"On the other hand, an extended school day could enable students to benefit from a more robust curriculum, with longer periods for more complex concepts. Additionally, this approach might be an attractive option for students who have part-time jobs or extracurricular commitments, as they would have longer days off.

Overall, while a four-day school week with ten hour days may have some benefits, they should be balanced with its drawbacks. From a student attendance perspective, this schedule could lead to increased absenteeism as students may need to juggle family matters on their long days off, such as childcare. 
The prospect of implementing a four-day school week with ten hour days has merits and drawbacks that must be considered. Furthermore, students should be encouraged to use their days off to help manage their stress levels, attend to necessary tasks, and engage in activities that promote mental and physical well-being.. It is important to remember that while increased flexibility may be a positive aspect, students must be able to cope with the extended days and additional academic demands. Furthermore, this model could prove overly taxing on students, leading to increased stress levels",1
"Students who involve in many activities it's complicated to take hours to study, and some times the parents need to leave his sons at the practice, many parents don't have time to do that because they work.

In opinion of the students is that best decision it's take only one activity. A lot of them works after school, so the activities is the best option and they don't deside to take this extracurricular activities. What are some decision that students take regarding extracurricular activoities?

Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have a little time to study or complete homework assignments.

Some activities carry out in the morning, with this the students have time to do his homeworks or study, however who practice in the afternoon can do it during school.

"It is important to remember that striving for effective problem-solving often brings us closer to finding the best possible solution. 
When faced with a problem, it is important to remember that underestimating any issue, regardless of size, can be detrimental. Additionally, mistakes should not be seen as shameful or embarrassing, but rather, enable us to gain valuable insight and understanding. For problems that involve multiple parties, it may be beneficial to utilize a mix of psychological strategies such as incorporating active communication, active listening, and understanding different points of view. Instead, individuals should try their best to assess the gravity of the situation and proceed with a peaceful and positive approach. Although some problems may appear daunting, one must keep in mind that there are supportive people and resources to turn to so one is never alone when it comes to problem-solving.",1
"     . In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own",0
"We all have the power to choose what kind of people we allow ourselves to be surrounded by and, in turn, by the company we keep, can shape our character and our decisions. This statement prompts the idea that our character is shaped by our mindset and environment. Having a positive mindset motivates us to reach our goals in life, and in doing so will shape our character. We all have the power and potential to shape and mold our character, but it is up to us to have the will power and perseverance to take the necessary steps.. It is all about having the courage to go out and take action to help create positive character traits and habits. 
The English philosopher John Lubbock once said, “We all have character traits that we have to consciously create or allow to be influenced by others”. 

The decisions and actions we take can lead to positive or negative outcomes in the formation of our character",1
"This should be embraced, rather than feared, as failure often gives us insight and teaches us valuable lessons. Having a strong mindset and the right attitude can be the difference between succeeding and throwing in the towel. By keeping our enthusiasm alive and staying optimistic, we set ourselves up for achieving our greatest successes.. In order for us to reach our goals, it is inevitable that we will experience failure along the way. 
The renowned British statesman Winston Churchill once famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” His words express a powerful idea: that failure is essential for success. This notion is particularly relevant in our modern lives, where every day we set ourselves goals and strive for success in all aspects of our lives. 

Winston Churchill’s quote encapsulates the idea that it is possible to utilize failure to propel us towards our desired outcomes. With each failure, we gain more experience and knowledge which can be used on our journey to success. We should use this knowledge to help power us towards our ultimate goals. Viewing failure in a positive light allows us to stay motivated and benefit from the lessons learned. 

The key to maintaining enthusiasm throughout this process is to remain optimistic and focus on our progress",1

Recent studies have shown that having a longer winter break than summer poses a threat to students’ ability to retain information. To ensure that students stay on top of their studies, it is important to limit the length of vacations and create regular breaks throughout the year.. Furthermore, experiences during a long vacation can affect a student's ability to pay attention in class, leading to a decreased understanding of the material. This is because of the physiological impact that extended vacations have on the brain. During a prolonged break, the brain is likely to forget more information, leading to fewer opportunities for recall",1
"Other people say that failure do not play in the pursuit of success.

Some people say that failure plays in the pursuit of succes because if we fail we learn how to stand up after every time we fall down,For thing we never had we have to do something we never did,If we fail big we learn big things,and we fail once we have to try again.

In life stuation we fail but it does not mean we never pass,Life is hard to deal with it but we can deal with it,every time we fail we have opportunity to fix it,Life is about gulliblety bad ideas come to our mind but we don't have to think about it we have to think positive,Every time we fail we think we are guilty,We think we are useless,We think we can not do it but there is somwthing in the back we have to catch it that thing is success.

We are skillful that thing is notthing against our skills,we always worried about what others think what we accomplish and what we carry out but it is our job that what we do, We have to lead our self to get success and we are the finder,there is alot of ways to pass we can get help from others:family,teachers,friends,and people;every body is liable for there own work.

Once i had biology class that i had to pass SOL I toke the SOL fourtimes at the last time i pass it,It was hard to pass SOL for me but i never stop accomplish even i hate that,In some point in our life we fail but we do not have to loss our firmness or solidity,We do not have to shrik responsibility,We have to strenghen our ideas,We ahve hopes in our life that we need to make them true,In some points in life we have to calm down take a teep breathe and focuse on our work, In a test when we fail we learn things like:what was in the test,how to use an other strategy to pass the test,how to try,and what can we use in the test like dictionary;This is how failure play in the pursuit of success.

"Not only does it give the individual a broader range of perspectives to consider, but it also helps to boost self-confidence. 
Asking for advice from multiple people when faced with challenging decisions or struggles in life can be beneficial for anyone. Opening up the dialogue with a variety of people also encourages the individual to be more candid and honest about their thoughts and feelings, leading to more holistic decision-making. Having the support and guidance from others can be an invaluable resource and give someone in need the assurance that their problems are being taken seriously. Ultimately, seeking advice from multiple people when faced with difficulties can make the journey easier and more fulfilling.",1
If you do a act of kind ness you might get some to say something good about to make you feel good. He said in his words NO! act of kind ness should never be wasted for no small reason I think that means that evreyone should do a serten amont of acts of kind ness a day like I said that I woud do do like one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy. You can feel good if you gave some a complement of there self and make them feel good. It is nice to do in genral. I think Aesop is a ancient greek king That can tell people to do act of kind ness. I think That is why he wants evreyone to do acts of kind ness. They wan't everyone to be kind and no wasting act of kindness. My oppinoion I wold at least do one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy. The ancient greek story teller said no act of kindness no act of kind nees shoud never be wasted no matter how small.

"They believe that tailoring our endeavors to our existing skills and abilities can also lead to growth. 
Many people agree that pushing yourself to do something outside of your comfort zone is an important aspect of growth and development. 

On the other hand, some people disagree with this statement. Through practice and refinement of what we have mastered, we can become highly skilled in that area. Pursuing interests within our comfort zone can also lead to success, and could even lead to areas of growth or learning that were not previously considered.

My opinion is that I generally agree with the statement “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.” While every situation is different and can be approached in various ways, I think there is a great opportunity to be seized when one pushes themselves to do something that initially seems difficult. It can be hard to step out of our comfort zones, but it can also be incredibly rewarding. Taking on a challenge can help us gain knowledge and experiences that can be used to foster further growth, and can also introduce us to interesting new ideas and opportunities.. Taking on challenges that are unfamiliar or difficult can help a person gain experiences and knowledge, allowing them to progress and develop as an individual",1
"Finally, the development of friendships and shared experiences through working in a group setting can foster positive emotions and boost morale, which can create an overall positive learning experience. 
Working in a group setting provides a multitude of advantages, particularly in the academic setting. While working in a group setting can have its unique challenges, the advantages of group work far outweigh its drawbacks.. Collaborating and sharing tasks with fellow students can often lead to higher academic success due to the division of labor and increased opportunities for problem-solving. Additionally, finding solutions that work for everyone is vital to ensure that the group's objectives are met.

In conclusion, group work provides students with numerous benefits, such as increased academic performance, improved social skills, and strengthened friendships. 

When working in a group, it is important to find the right balance between collaboration and division of labor, in order to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of the group. Additionally, working in groups can foster important social skills such as communication and teamwork, while reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness that can often occur when working alone",1
"So i continued learning how to cook the egg, and now i succeed with the fried egg dish. So i asked her how to made that egg, and of course i had broken a lot of eggs. I thought that if i fail,i 'll have more experience. Some people think they are smart and they'd never fail. I remembered when i was 8, i was really love the egg that my mom made for me. And i also wanted to give up, but, i'm really love the foods that made from egg. I have failed many times in my life, but i never give up. I think i'm going to agree what Churchill had said. In my conclusion, i want to say that being a failure isn't a bad thing, because it helps me know that i can do better.. For an example, in my country, Vietnam, people always say that failure is the key lead to your success. Because, if i success so easily, i won't able to understand how hard to earn something.

Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution.

The energy, and the resources are the most important factors in the world, for the evolution and survival of the human. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening.

First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources",0
"In conclusion thats why high school students should take early graduation program. However students who take this program and they are going to college they could finish more early college and students who not going to college they can start working more early. But students who take this program are more exposed to fail or give up for the rush time that is in the programs and regular school years don`t have that problem. . Why high school school students should not take school programs that allow to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years .Students who take this program most take class after school , summer time or they not allow to take elective courses .Consequently students who take this program have less time to do homework, spend time with family or friends, enjoy the summer time or they not allow to take important elective classes like, foreign language, nutrition, music classes, computer skill class, or HPE.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change and I agree with that statement, because it is hard to change people's mind and the way they think about you.

When someone know you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. Because it is very hard to change the way a person thinks. First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearence or the way you act.

Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who thinks that it is not hard to change first impressions , and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions.

To conclude first impressions are almost impossible to change and people should be more carefully about first impressions. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change.

Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. and also it can affect your reputation. Then they just keep their distance or go away and you can not do anything to change their opinion. First impressions are very important because that is the way people know you",0
"It is fun because i used to play an insturment the last three years and it was fun because you get to go to trips. We went with the orchestra class, band, and even chores. and its nice to play an insrument because you have alot of oppsions to choose from and you even get to play nice soothing music or loud and extreame. so i recommend you to go look for an activity that fits yoou right and that enjoyable and educational.. And the fun part is that you get to be in a stage with your friends and play music infront of the audiance.

Another enjoyable activity is chemistry its fun because you get to mix different chemicals to objects or chemical to chemical. In this new year that we are now there are thosands of enjoyable and educational activitys. These activitys should be done because they are very fun.

An activity can be fun is like playing a sport their are alot of sports out there that can be fun and aggresive but its exciting to play a sport because you get to go on trips and you get to verse other teams or with only one player. Mixing chemicals can be hard and scary because what happens if you mix the chemcals and something happens in chemistry you have to be very careful with what chemicals are you mixing together.

I am very happy because you have thosands or hundres of activitys to choose from because their are alot of people who are loking for a good and fun activity. you get to even become a professional player

I played soccer for about two years and now i am good at it. nI really loved that activity because you learn more and become good at it.

Another activity that can be fun and cool and enjoyable is playing an insturment. They can be fun because you get to do alot of things with them. Last year me and my friends went to Generic_City. Before in elemantary school i used to be bad at it and used to say ""im bad at this"" or ill say ""im not good at it"" but then i entered in a summer soccer program every evening or in the day i would go to a school and we would go to a soccer field. Me and my science class will be doing it this year i am happy to do it becaue i never mixed chemicals or never put on science goggles. it was fun. i cant wait to do it this year we will be doing chemisry in april",0
"Without failure, success is impossible.. After several unsuccessful attempts, I was eventually able to accomplish my goal of becoming a small business owner. Similarly, many successful entrepreneurs have learned from their own failures to build successful businesses. It is often said that failure is an essential ingredient in developing personal success. Such stories demonstrate the invaluable lesson that without failure, success cannot be achieved. Though failure can be painful, it is also immensely valuable for growth and development. 
The essay will examine the role that failure plays in individual success. To understand this phenomenon, one must look at the individual experiences and successes of successful people. For example, I can personally attest to the power of failure in my own life. In conclusion, when it comes to success, failure is not only necessary, it is inescapable",1
"This will encourage diligent study and draw out a creative and thoughtful approach to new material. 

In conclusion, allowing students the choice of what elective classes to take is of the utmost importance. 

Not every student enjoys the same classes, and it is to the benefit of the student, teacher, and school system if students are able to explore what they are genuinely interested in. Having the freedom to pick and choose elective classes can also open the student up to unexpected interests they may not have known to have before. This choice allows students to explore different interests, diversify their education, and pursue passions both in and outside of their normal academic endeavors. If students had more choice, their motivation and improved engagement could lead to better learning. 

Requiring students to take a certain set of elective classes could also result in a time-consuming process without a significant educational benefit. Offering students the ability to evaluate each class and make an informed decision about their own personal education can have significant impacts on both the teaching staff and the student body, boosting motivation to learn and succeed in their studies.. Forcing students to take every elective class can be a waste of time because it does not allow for students to follow natural inclinations that are unique to them. Students can be made to complete classes they have little interest in, joining in lectures with minimal engagement or enthusiasm. 
The right to choose elective classes is of the utmost importance for students",1
"We learn that the work is a big responsability. Just we need to try. Students in high school get experiences learn about how they can find a job. Second step we need to put all our efforts every day. Students develop their emotional knowledgel; also, we start to proceed as adult. The last year I was in Internship class that was great because they give me the opportunity to get a job. If we have something that would like to be for example: doctors, secretary, actors, or nurse whatever we want. The life is a challenge if we don't try we can never get a good career. develop our skills is so important. In Generic_School my school, we have Internship class. Two years ago when I entered to high school

I was not sure what I want to be. We can do everything what we want because we are intelligents,positives,and great students. Students develop their emotional knowledgel; also, we start to proceed as adult.

Many students learn many laguages this is a great skill because we can travel every where, comunicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak differents languages we can earn more money, get a better job. Many students learn many laguages this is a great skill because we can travel every where, comunicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak differents languages we can earn more money, get a better job. Now, I know what I want to be, but that is thanks to my school that they have many ideas how we can identify a career. The job was about secretery I was in love with this job; however, was not easy to learn but I liked. I would like to be a secretary.

Don't matter if we are youngs, we can learn everything. Students have all the capacity to learn everything, so let's go to do it.

To summarize, all the students should identify a career in high school. Some people think that the students can not identify a career by the time they enter to high school. keep going becauses that's is the only way that we have.

Lastly, When we develop our passions we can get a good career. Firts step we need to faces our fears. Is for these reasons and many other that students should indentify a career in high school.. I would like to say go head! we can do it. It is a good idea for students to commit to a carreer at a young age because we can mature our mind, develop our skills, and develop our passions. It is so important identify what we want to do when we grow-up.

Additionally, develop our skills is a great idea that can help us. We can develop many many skills if we wants. The life is a challenge if we don't try we can never get a good career. If we wants a great career we need to put in practice the dicipline. Students in high school need to know these two steps",0
"Family dynamics are incredibly powerful, as the values and practices we observe at home become ingrained in our personal frameworks, influencing our decisions now and in the future.

On a larger scale, the influence of society and its institutions is something that affects us all. It is no mistake that the perception of education in our society is of the utmost importance; we associate success with education, something that is passed down to us in various ways from school. We observe their behaviors and mannerisms, often unconsciously mimicking the way they communicate and interact with others. It is widely accepted that we are subject to the influence of a variety of people and institutions in our lives. These key elements only come into play when we learn to recognize the importance of listening to one another, and understanding our shared humanity.. From family to society, school to social media, we are constantly exposed to examples of how others behave, and these examples shape us in unpredictable ways.

Take our family, for instance; as children, we look to our parents to learn how to interact with the world — both what is appropriate and inappropriate. It has provided us with a platform to interact with other people, providing a vast space for examples to be viewed and replicated. Whether it’s through the lessons we learn in the classroom, the expectations of grades, or the aspirations to achieve more, these values are taught to us from a young age, creating an expectation to try and do the best we can.

Furthermore, social media has become another incredibly powerful influence in recent times. We are constantly exposed to what others are saying, doing, and believing, creating a proliferation of ideals and beliefs that have the power to shape us.

Though the influence of other people can be beneficial to a certain extent, it is important to note that example is not the only thing in influencing others — respect, dialogue, and mutual understanding are just as important. 
Example:

The actions of others have long been said to influence us as individuals",1
"From everyday people to entire nations, an idle lifestyle can often lead to stagnation, which often leads to missed opportunities and, in some cases, a complete reversal of fortune.

In order to avoid a similar fate and ensure a prosperous future, active behavior must remain at the forefront of our minds. We can use our devices to make our lives easier and put off taking action until tomorrow, or even until next week. Unfortunately, this has had dire consequences more than once, leading to tragic consequences and lost opportunities.

Today, technology has made it easier than ever to live an idle lifestyle.  So let us take his words as a reminder to stay active and seize the day so that we can create a better future and leave behind a lasting legacy.. Such a mindset will not only help us reach our individual goals more efficiently but will also benefit the country as a whole. However, the flip side of this mentality has been the risk of becoming too passive and idle in our society. But if history has taught us anything, it's that idle behavior comes with a price. Taking Thomas Jefferson’s words to heart, we must not be afraid to invest our time and energy into something today rather than waiting until tomorrow. From Thomas Jefferson's famous maxim that encouraged citizens to ""never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today,"" an active and industrious spirit has been fundamental to our success. 
Throughout American history, the push for active thought and behavior has been a key factor in our nation's progress",1
"

Additionally, it can be beneficial for students to work independently. 
Working alone often has a number of advantages over working in groups. Independence and efficiency are both major benefits that can help to foster an environment of intellectual inquiry and personal growth.. 

Overall, I believe that it is often better for students to work alone than in a group. You won't have to waste time trying to work out group dynamics or compromise on decisions. For starters, it can be more efficient since you only have to consider your own needs and preferences. When faced with a challenging problem, the individual is better equipped to simply focus on the task at hand rather than trying to coordinate a group. It also instills a sense of autonomy and responsibility, as there are no other people to depend on to complete tasks. Working alone offers them the opportunity to learn to think critically and come up with their own solutions",1
"Taking a career course at a young age can be beneficial in that it helps to give students an idea of what they may be interested in, and a better understanding of the different career paths available and their pros and cons. Ultimately, the decision is a very personal one; one should consider all the factors and weigh all potential benefits and drawbacks before making a decision.. However, it is also important to take into account the drawbacks of committing to a specific career path at a young age. One may feel pressured to pigeonhole themselves into a certain career and may miss out on other opportunities down the line. 
When it comes to choosing a career path, it is important to consider the implications for the future",1
"First, Knowledge created stuff that is real. I am disagree with this statement because thing that are made up from mind seems to be not real. You learn that skill from knowledgeable teacher. Finally, knowledge is more power full then imagination.. For examples: a car that had been made by a knowledgeable person, can solve your life time problems, but an imaginary car is not real at all. People have made a lot of money true their knowledge. In conclusion, knowledge can help you with your life time.

In conclusion, Knowledge created stuff that are real. People today have invented a lot of things because of their knowledge. we should work together."" For example you have the skill to invented a phone, and you solled that phone to a person and you made a huge amount of money. Lastly, Knowledge can make you be rich.

Knowledge created stuff that exist. In conclusion, there are so many stuff that had been invented(created) true knowledge.

If you present the thing you invented from your knowledge, a company might respond to you and say,""hey, people really loved your invention. You would want to invent more and more to make a lot of money. all human have the knowledge to read",0
"It can also allow one to quite literally fast-track their educational ambitions. The main downside concerns the age at which the student would be graduating. However, there are students that may benefit greatly from such a program if they are mature, focused, and confident in their aspirations. As well, a lack of educational experience as compared to one’s peers can be a substantial hindrance.

Based on the research conducted, it could be concluded that the three-year program was unsuitable for some students, especially those that may not be fully ready to be out on their own as a young adult. 
After extensive research on the pros and cons of attending only three years of high school education instead of the traditional four-year program, it appears that some major points must be considered. From the perspective of the student, attending only three years of high school would reduce the amount of time spent in school, which can be beneficial depending on the quality of one’s educational experience. Going off to college or entering the workforce as a young adult three years earlier than the norm can be a daunting experience for some individuals. Ultimately, the student should gain advice from health and education professionals before making a decision about the program.",1
"                                               . This type of projects give you a lot of knowledge, and this projects give you an idea on how nature works is easy to do and is fun. This is fun because you get to help friends out, and do experiments with chemicals. Working on a project with friends is always gonna be fun specially on a science one because you have to repeat the project three times to make sure it gives the same result every time and its super educational to do.

The chemicals you use during a project could be dangers but at the same time they could be fun to use. This is one of the most enjoyable educational things to do.

Doing a science project gives knowledge specially if is about nature. If the project is about nature the things you'r gonna learn are fun and easy for example what causes wind,solar system,and how does the moon help us this projects are gonna make you learn about how earth works. One educational activity I like to do is doing a science project is the most fun thing to do with your friends. This is an educational fun project because you get to see how the reaction of different chemicals. The most fun part of a project is that you get to repeat things more then once in order to get the correct results is the most fun thing during a project testing out stuff. Also working as a team with you'r friends is helpful because you get to hear different parts,and it would help you learn more about the project you are doing.

Working as a team to see the different points of view of everyone is fun,and it helps for the project. Also getting help form your friends is better everyone gets to give ideas and help with the fun project. Learning is boring but the science projects make learning more fun and it gives ideas for future projects. For me this is the most fun thing to do when i have a project, and theres so many more activities but a science project is enjoyable to do and is also the most fun thing to do. A science project is also fun because you get to work with chemicals and see the reaction of each chemical. Presenting the the project would make you nervous if your by your self if you did it in a group its gonna be fun and also more easy. This is one of the most enjoyable educational stuff you can do and its fun.

This is an enjoyable thing to do you have so much fun doing a project,and Helping out friends by giving them ideas for the project working as a team to make it perfect and learning",0
"My brother is one of the most kindness person in the world. Its all about attitude.

It's been a while for all the moment's that I lived in my entire life. He could talk with an angry person, and just a few minutes, he would be able to change they're mind, how can that be possible?. My cousin is the one that teach me how to be a better person just with attitude,

because of some problem's that we have in our family, for all the things that happen in my country, and also for the death of my uncle.

I love my big brother, I want to be as him, for the things he achievement on all his life. Every single night that I'm going to sleep, I think all about what I did during the whole day, and I go over to think what do I did wrong, and what do I have to change to have a awesome personality, so when people talk to me, just for the way I talk, they would know if I have a great attitude. Every single person who can not do their own things with attitude, is like if they're not doing it with energy.

My mom change radically her attitude when she's talking with an unknown person. I do agree, attitude is energy, and without energy we are nothing.

All the time, the attitude of every single person could change radically, but that could demonstrate what kind of person who you are. The attitude can help people life, because when you are going to ask for a application to get an employment, if you are thinking negative things, nothing is going to be positive to you.",0
"Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self.

But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. According to me, I think that technology has change people's style of living. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days.

At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they don't do much physical activities.

Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology in today's life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on people's life. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us.             . It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. So less use of technology gives us positive effects and more use of it gives us negative effects",0
"The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time.

When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting.

Makeup Is one of the funest. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Playing the violin Is hard at first but when people practice and they want to be talented It gets easy. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience.

They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin.

Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. People and students' have some amazing talents and skills. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students' had to play by their self.    ",0
"everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and don't surrender don't give up with our goals, always been happy doesn't paying attention to the situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  . According to a quote that say ''You can loss a battle but not the war'', In fact we can loss everything but not our enthusiasm.

In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. Success is about to enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience.

My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self ,and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I loss my job because I didn't have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is a example how failure didn't take my enthusiasm, and that we can loss twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later.

My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want,

A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didn't pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success.

Other might say that success and failing isn't good for our society, however I sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later",0
"I did to for accepting my friendship with Generic_Name, if she really was a good friend, she would of told me she wants the best for me, and not lie about something that isn't even true, When someone lies to you, it's hard for you to gain their trust. We got each others instagram, snap chat, and our phone numbers.

We all wanted to hang out again, but tomorrow It's going to rain, and It's going to be really muddy, and wet outside. When Generic_Name told me his brother's name, my heart started beating really fast, I was really happy that I would do anything in this world.

Generic_Name comes up to me, and says hi, I was really nervous, me and Generic_Name were talking while are siblings were playing. We got home, and we ate dinner, we all took a shower, and did our night routine. We were going down the slide at the park, and I was with my brother, and sister. We had school tomorrow, and me and my friends were talking about it, but Generic_Name didn't seem as happy, as we all did. Generic_Name told me that all those bad things she told me about Generic_Name aren't true, she did that, so I would stop liking Generic_Name. Generic_Name is Generic_Name's ex girlfriend.

I was very upset, and started crying, I went straight to my house, and Generic_Name came with me too, she's my best friend, and she's always there for me, when I really need her the most, I told Generic_Name what Generic_Name told me. She told me she needed to talk to me, but in secret. If there is something wrong with you, talk to the person you feel more confident talking to, you can talk to your mom, dad, your principle, counselor, dean, or anyone you truly trust.

There's always a time where you accept some bad friendships, that give you bad influence, but it's okay. I called Generic_Name that I needed to talk to him, so I gave Generic_Name my address.

Generic_Name came over, I told him everything that Generic_Name told me, he told me she was lying, because she's jealous of me, and she liked him, but Generic_Name didn't feel the same way as Generic_Name did.

Generic_Name told me that he liked me since the time, he made eye contact with me. So we went to the library. It was a really nice day so we went to the park. Generic_Name told me he already knew Generic_Name. Girls shouldn't change over a guy that doesn't feel the same way as you do, and boy's shouldn't either! God has someone waiting for you!

If you really trust someone, don't loose their trust! A lot of people can give bad or good experience to you, but you have to see who's being a bad friend to you, and who's being a good friend to you. He had a really cute little sister, and she's two years old, and her name is Generic_Name, and Generic_Name is ten years old.

I asked Generic_Name what his brother's name was, he told me it was Generic_Name. I had so much notifications from my friends, I totally forgot i sent them a text, I told them everything that happened. My siblings are pretty annoying, but I still love them. Be careful in who you trust, there are several people that are there for you no matter what. I don't trust a lot of people just my best friends, and my most favorite teacher, because the people that care about you the most, are the ones that want the best for you, they're not jealous of you, like Generic_Name was. There are a lot of people that can give you bad influence, and a lot of people can give you good influence. We got to know each other, and now we're best friends.

I'm so glad I met Generic_Name! We have so much things in common, we both like the same sport, which is soccer. Generic_Name told me she knew Generic_Name, and she told me so much bad thing about Generic_Name. It was really sunny, and warm, Then this cute guy came, and right away I text my friends about it.

My brother somehow started playing with Generic_Name. You have to learn your lesson to the people that lie, your realize how you loose friends by just lying.

Me and Generic_Name are now dating, we are focusing in school, because school is important, and no matter what others say, me and him are going to be happy, and no one will ever change that. The saddest thing is that we don't go to the same school, I go to Generic_School, and he goes to Generic_School. I really didn't expect Generic_Name telling me that, I thought he would never like me. If I haven't told you what their names are, I'll tell you right now! My brother's name is Generic_Name, and my sister's name is Generic_Name, My name is Generic_Name. Be careful in who you trust, and never change for anyone, because you are amazing just the way you are!",0

Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

And many ways I think it does, and in others I think it doesn't. I always preferred to be with my cousin, and my childhood friends then be in my house talking about boring things, but now you can not have simple conversation with some people because when you are talking to them most of the time they are in they phone doing who knows what, and I don't know about you. technology has made every more easier, you can do almost anything, you can shopping without leave your house, order food...

and all this stuff made people lazy, maybe they ask thyself why should I do this when my small phone or computer can do it for me, why should I date someone to talk to them when I can do it by my phone, why should I have to have a conversation with somebody when there is a whole lot of thing that I can do in my phone or competed. every positive thing has to have it on negative thing.

it has a negative effect on people lives because with the advice of the technology phone, and others the people are losing the interest in norma things, like some people don't even care about family reunion. I mean I never really care about that staff neither. It depend on the person, that's what I believe.

It has a positive effects in the way that it can help people that feel along entertain thyself without nobody, I don't think that there are many things nothing worst then feel along. and I had seen many people who prefer all those things before then be along, and checking out book, shopping, playing games, listening music in your favorite app, Pandora... or watching you favorite show in YouTube, Netflix or whatever other app that you use is positive way of use the technology.

But you know in the worth nothing is perfect,like my grandfather used to say ""there has to be bad things, so that there could be good things"". but to me that's a disreperfull way to tell me that you don't care about what i'm saying, and that could made people dislike you.

technology is one of the greatest things ever invented, it made more easier the communication, it give entertainment to the people, it inform us of every that is happening in the worth, even in the space, and we don't have to read a whole book to find answer. that can do bad things to people brains, and I am not saying that there is nothing worst, I mean be in prison, not had a job, die... not letting it get into your mind. And maybe you are going to keep asking the same question to yourself unto the day that there would be no body by your side.

In Conclusion the technology is something very good, if you use it just when you need it.     ",0
"While pushing boundaries is important for growth, sometimes we can learn more by staying within our capability and experimenting from there.

Taking on something we know can help build confidence and hone our abilities in areas we are already familiar with. But it can also be incredibly rewarding. Each journey, big or small, can help us to move forward, even if we choose to stay close to home.. However, going too far beyond our existing knowledge can be overwhelming, leading to more difficulty in achieving our goals. Working within the realms of one's comfort zone can also help jog creative juices, allowing us to come up with new ideas and perspectives we may not have seen before. 
Having the courage to step outside of one's comfort zone and venture into the unknown can be terrifying and intimidating. 

Ultimately, whether we're trying something new or mastering the things we already know, both enable us to progress. This may involve perfecting an existing skill—becoming a virtuoso on the guitar, for example—or just exploring all the possibilities that already exist with the tools we already possess. It is important to ensure that we are constantly learning, whether that involves taking on something completely unfamiliar or not",1
Teachers should not be able design the students project because the students might have have trouble on the assignment the teacher gives them over the break and they wont be able to get help because the teacher and the students will be on break and it will make it hard for the students to finish the work and if students choose what they want to do for their project it will be easy and understandable for them and they can do a lot of research on what they they do on their project and when the students get to do what they want n the project they can get good credit on the assignment if the teacher gets to choose what the student does on there project then then the students will have a hard time thinking and coming up with ideas for there assignment and probably wont do good on the project and fail if students get to design what they want to do on there project then there creativity will go up and the way they think will be different and if they design it themselves then they will be more intrested in the assignment then if the teacher did designed it then the students would probably wont do the assignment.,0
"Take, for example, the immensely valuable service that is calling 911. 
Technology has revolutionized the way we live our lives. People can now talk to someone on the other side of the world in mere seconds, sharing knowledge and experiences seamlessly. Technology has also made it quicker and easier than ever to access medical care, store important documents, stay on top of the news, and even pursue education from anywhere in the world. It has opened the world up to people in unprecedented ways, allowing us to communicate more easily and quickly than ever before. Technology has also enabled us to access vital services in times of emergency. All of these benefits are truly invaluable and further illustrate how technology has improved people's lives.. This has saved countless lives over the years and is part of why technology is so important. Through the simple press of a button, we can be connected to professional help and receive assistance when needed",1
"It is important to consider the implications that an extended school day could have on both the students and the teachers before making a decision. For teachers, the extra hours of work could lead to increases in stress and workload. To address any potential issues, it may be necessary to provide additional support, such as extra funding for teacher aid or extended breaks for students. With the right support, the extended school day could be beneficial to all involved.. For students, it could mean added physical and mental fatigue due to the increased time in the classroom. It could be difficult for students to maintain a healthy balance between school and their personal lives. 
Extending the school day could have drastic effects on both the students and the teachers",1
"In many cases, one of these methods can be excellent for encouraging or motivating another person. 

Ultimately, using examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice to influence others positively can be extremely beneficial, as evidenced by countless successful relationships and teams.. Actions, such as leading by example, can also be beneficial in reinforcing the idea that positive behavior can be rewarding. 

Providing reasons for why a course of action should be taken, or why a certain result is desired, can help create understanding and spark interest in the subject in question. Further, providing personalized advice tailored to the individual can help show that their opinions and voice matter and can help to hone in on the best course of action. 
The ability for examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice to positively influence others is vast and multifaceted. 

For example, providing a relevant or relatable example can help someone to envision a goal or understand an idea more deeply",1
"They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore.

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. Different things can have an impact in your life, but that's how we all stated from very beginning; we never known we had a special talent until we try something new.. No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. You will never grow into something you want to be in the future if you don't find your inner indite. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one",0
"People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life.

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things.

You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true.

It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt.

People wont be able to brake you down that easily.

So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life.

When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it.

Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking ""oh theres no way im going to make it"".

Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action.

Sometimes your words reflect your actions.

This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life.

Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"".

Lets talk about why i mention ""faith"".

Having faith makes you believe in yourself'

When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action.

But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible.

This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other.

So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a possitive attitude.

Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too.

If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad.

The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours.

For example, if i say to myself ""Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try"".

Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try.

So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",0
"From strengthening physical and mental health to developing skills, outdoor activities can be a great way to get outside and enjoy the natural environment.. The teamwork, communication, athleticism, and strategy involved in the game makes it an enjoyable learning experience that builds confidence and brings lasting satisfaction. 

Riding a bike is a great way to stay in shape and explore the outdoors.  

Playing football is a perfect way to bond with friends, get an intense cardio workout, and have a good time. There are so many enjoyable activities to enjoy while out in nature – from catching a ball with family and friends to riding a bike down a scenic trail or playing a pick-up game of football, outdoor activities can be the perfect way to get exercise and unwind. It is also an inexpensive form of transportation that can help us connect with our environment outside of the car. We learn to listen closely to directions we are given and how to work as a team. It requires eye-hand coordination, which is important both on the field and in our everyday lives. 

Overall, spending time outdoors comes with numerous benefits. A leisurely bike ride can help reduce stress, improve our mood, and increase concentration. 
Spending time outdoors offers a myriad of both physical and mental benefits. 

Playing catch teaches us the basics of good communication and cooperation",1
"Attend to class offer students communication to easier solve their problems, created competition place for students and experiences inspiration from the teachers for students have a better way to learn. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students would not struggle with the same mistake they did. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students.

The first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. For example, some students have watched video, and they still misunderstand and how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home.

The last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students.

The second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. . Those are the most important things school offer to students. Those things that online learning students would never received. class is not just a lesson, it is also the small society that students should have before the real life. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way. School always creating the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That was the reason why attend classes better than onine learning at home. That was the most valuation that students can not get anywhere except in class.

Eventually, classes give students a lot of thing that they would not benefit from being at home. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal",0
"I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. And you can be late for school. If weather is such a bad you can't go out of the house still able to attend classes from home. Even if you sick for a week you still able to attend to school everyday by way of online or video conferencing. They're able to work in online.

In conclusion, for online or video conferencing students doesn't need to worry about there attended. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. If they late in every first classes they might fail that classes. In many states students live far from schools. Suppose they use the online conferencing they can be on time in every classes.

Also, attend to school everyday. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Sometimes they can't be on time because of highway traffic. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

First, distance learning students attend classes on time by online. You can join to the class even if you go to your friends house. You can attend school by way of online or video conferencing.

Then, By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere. Although none is home to drop you off to the school. Also if you plan to go out the state for few days you can attend to classes from there. Students can enjoy also they can study. Sometimes cause of bad weather you have to drive slow than speed limit",0
"It also allows the school to tailor its teaching efforts to the needs of the student body since it will already know the courses that need to be taught.

However, this system of course selection can be limiting for students. Allowing students to choose their courses late in their high school career gives them an opportunity to delve into different fields and discover their true passions.. After considering the opinion of both students and parents, it is clear that flexibility and personal choice are essential components of a successful school curriculum. 

On the plus side, this system allows the students to get more in-depth experience in the field they’ve chosen. This practice has both pros and cons for both the students and their parents. Additionally, even when students want to pursue a different career, they may be forced to take courses for their chosen profession.

It is therefore important to weigh the pros and cons before implementing a system of mandatory course selection. If their interests or ambitions change over time, they may not have the opportunity to sample courses outside of their chosen profession. 
At the Seven Oaks School, students must choose the courses for their chosen profession at an early age",1
"If you not sure if its right or wrong, then you should ask someone for their opinion. It better to keep in mind that your family and friends have faith in you. At that point, I realized my parents were always right.

My parents have made mistakes before too. After couple weeks of having social media, someone decided to hack my snapchat. After couple minutes, my mom realized I wasnt there so she ran out of the house to find me and than couple blocks down she saw in someones shop. The only reason why my parents said,""no"", to social media was because they didn't want me to get hacked by people. So, I crawled out of the house and they didnt see me.                                                      . All though, my parents said no to socail media i got it anyways. After we got to my grandparents home, my parents forgot to close the door behind us. If you do something wrong then people will change the way they look at you. After that, this guy saw me crawling down the streets and there were cars driving by me. I believe that Winston Churchill's quote,""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is true because after you make the mistake you learn how not to make that mistake again. I think that you should always isten to your elders because they have been threw rough and happy days. I was thirteen when I got my first phone and my parents always told me to not have social media till i'm sixteen. When we are little, we always think that our parents are being really strict, but they're only trying to keep us happy.

I have made alot of mistakes when I was a pre-teen and I still make mistakes now,but at the end i realize that I was wrong. When I waa a baby, my parents took me to my grandparents house for the first time. The only way to learn how to be successful is to make a mistake. If that doesn't work out than your probably doing something wrong. My parents always checked if the door was closed after that incident.

Always keep in mind that you shouldnt do anything without thinking of the affects. So, the guy carried me to his shop to see if anyone comes to find me",0
"Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged.

To close up studenst will gain knolege and enjoy writing. Undoubtedly, students do better on a topic they all feel good about.

Finally the students will enjoy doing the project. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. finally studenst inprove there skills when writing something they enjoy.

To start with, summer projects should be student designed. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. How ever they are wrong. Some school require students to complete summer projects. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. Students should be able to pick their topic do to they know what interest them and what doesnt. . Generic_Name has never done sports her self so there she has no interest on it. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed.

Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. They will aslo do better in the project do to is in there best interest. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project.

Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength they'll aim for that A on the project. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. For example, Generic_Name was given the topic to right about sports Generic_Name. Second they would put more effort and time on the project",0
"Have you ever thought of a place in the world you would like to visit? Some people would go to France to see the popular Eiffel Tower; while others would go to Hawaii just to relax. And Also because there are outstanding waterfalls and parks. Furthermore, most of the people in Dubai make a honest living and there is rarely any crimes caused by residents.

Additionally, there are amazing waterfalls and parks because the designs and structures are well made and created. . And something I would like to do once I arrive, is to greet these grateful and thankful people because they are gentle to one another. And also because there are amazing waterfalls and parks.

To begin with, the people there are well mannered and kind because they treat each other like brothers and sisters instead of mortal enemies. For instance, when visiting the waterfalls at night, it is very colorful which makes it beautiful to watch. For me however, I would like to visit Generic_City because the people there are well mannered and kind. Also, something I would like to do when I arrive, is to go on a boat ride because it is very peaceful and it make you feel calm as the ride goes along.

In conclusion, a place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City because the people there are well disciplined and nice",0
"Another way a student can get help is asking a friend for help. Also for the people that want to finish there homework. One way they can get help is by asking a teacher for help. This is how students can get help easily.

Students can finish there work at school. They could play games. Lastly It gives them an chance to learn more.

Students can get help in a homework club easily. Establishing a homework club would be a great idea because students can get help. When they finish there work at school they got more time to do whatever they want. They can get help with a teacher and a friend. In conclusion people can do more things when there done with there work.

This gives them a chance to learn more because they can ask more questions and get there work done.

In conclusion they should establish a homework club for the people that need help. They could read a book. Thats why they should establish homework club. Another reason this is useful to student is because they could finish all her/his work and get more time to do what they want at home. they could take frequent naps",0
"Finally, while some colleges may accept early graduates, others may not, and students may have to adjust their plans if their desired school does not have policies in place for early graduation.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years can be a great way for students to get a head start on their college education. One of the main benefits of graduating early is that students can skip some of the core courses they would normally take, saving them time. 
Graduating from high school in three years is an increasingly popular choice for students who want to save time, money, and get an early start on their college careers. However, they must be prepared to balance their studies with other responsibilities, and be mindful that some colleges may not accept early graduation.. It can also reduce the cost of college, as students would spend one fewer year paying tuition.

However, there are some potential downsides. High school students who wish to graduate early may find it difficult to balance their course load with extracurricular activities and part-time jobs. It can be a great way to start a career or gain real-world experience sooner. It can also be challenging to fit in the required credits in three years",1
"Instead of being overwhelmed and defeated by them, I try to remain focused and look for solutions. When struggles arise, it’s an opportunity to develop resilience and learn from the experience. It’s important to be able to take a step back, assess the situation, and come up with a way to prevent the same problem from occurring again. I’ve learned that it’s essential to be able to pick myself up and keep moving forward no matter what life throws my way. This philosophy has served me well throughout my life, and is something I encourage everyone to embrace.

I have always viewed my problems as a chance for me to do my best. 
Growing up, I faced many problems and hard times. By taking this approach, I have learned how to be resilient and determined, and am constantly striving to become better.

Hard times can also be a great teacher. I believed that if I could just push through it, I would come out stronger on the other side. Through my own experiences, I have learned that these challenges can be difficult to overcome, but they can also be used to benefit and better oneself.. As someone who has struggled in the past, I know first-hand how hard times can build up strength.

Additionally, hard issues can show someone how to make better decisions in the future. With this understanding, I have been able to make thoughtful decisions and have avoided repeating the same mistakes.

In conclusion, I believe that problems can be a meaningful chance to do your best, hard times can build up strength, and issues can show someone how to do better in the future. Whenever I encountered a difficult situation, I saw it as an opportunity for self-improvement and personal growth",1

Some people have good decision is because they confidently with own life?

people who make good decision is becuase they cofidently with own life and experience when they are young.

My project topic is the history of the American Civil Rights movement. I'm looking into primary sources, including personal accounts from those who experienced the movement, as well as other sources such as books, articles, and blogs. I plan to conduct interviews with family and friends to gain a more personal insight into the importance of the Civil Rights Movement and to highlight the collective experiences of people on the ground. This will help to provide a well-rounded, comprehensive overview of the movement and its effect on people of color in the United States.. I will also use modern technology to look at the current landscape of the civil rights movement, especially any changes that have taken place since it occured. I plan to create a timeline presentation and corresponding paper outlining key historical events, intertwined with personal research about important figures in the movement and their legacies. Additionally, I plan to explore visual sources such as newspaper archives and documentaries",1
"The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. It will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they don't live around the school area. Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. Conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. In the case for students that don't have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well.

Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. Adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. That's one of the best ways to conserve cars' energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas.

Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people.

To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs.

In conclusion, Adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged.

Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the school's building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Firstly: conserving energy light and food and saving gas and money, having extra time for work, friends and most important: Family.. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school",0

In opinion of the students is that best decision it's take only one activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        . What are some decision that students take regarding extracurricular activoities?

Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have a little time to study or complete homework assignments.

Some activities carry out in the morning, with this the students have time to do his homeworks or study, however who practice in the afternoon can do it during school. A lot of them works after school, so the activities is the best option and they don't deside to take this extracurricular activities",0
"Additionally, as one gains more experience, any mistakes seem less disastrous and can provide further lessons to build upon. As one practices and starts to gain experience, the skills and knowledge become second nature and can serve as a guide in the journey. Ultimately, this cumulative effort of practice and experience helps to empower and drive one’s journey..  Practicing and having more experience helps to give the necessary tools and confidence to pursue and attain success. Practice and experience are essential components in this journey. 
Emerson once said, “Life is a journey, not a destination.” This statement speaks to the idea that success is not the end goal, but rather the by-product of the journey. Practice helps to ingrain the skills and learning necessary to become successful",1
"With this understanding, I have been able to make thoughtful decisions and have avoided repeating the same mistakes.

In conclusion, I believe that problems can be a meaningful chance to do your best, hard times can build up strength, and issues can show someone how to do better in the future. This philosophy has served me well throughout my life, and is something I encourage everyone to embrace.

I have always viewed my problems as a chance for me to do my best. I’ve learned that it’s essential to be able to pick myself up and keep moving forward no matter what life throws my way. As someone who has struggled in the past, I know first-hand how hard times can build up strength.

Additionally, hard issues can show someone how to make better decisions in the future. I believed that if I could just push through it, I would come out stronger on the other side. By taking this approach, I have learned how to be resilient and determined, and am constantly striving to become better.

Hard times can also be a great teacher. 
Growing up, I faced many problems and hard times. Through my own experiences, I have learned that these challenges can be difficult to overcome, but they can also be used to benefit and better oneself.. When struggles arise, it’s an opportunity to develop resilience and learn from the experience. Instead of being overwhelmed and defeated by them, I try to remain focused and look for solutions. Whenever I encountered a difficult situation, I saw it as an opportunity for self-improvement and personal growth. It’s important to be able to take a step back, assess the situation, and come up with a way to prevent the same problem from occurring again",1
"With the use of technology, businesses no longer have to rely solely on manual labor for their operations. From the development of modern medicine, to providing an easier means of communication and transportation, technology has significantly changed our lifestyle for the better. This, in turn, not only saves critical time and resources but also provides a better standard of care for patients worldwide.

Not only does technology improve our lifestyle, but it also supports knowledge and education. We can only imagine what the future holds in store for us with advancements in technology.. 
Technology has profoundly impacted humanity in positive ways throughout the years. 

One major example of this is in the healthcare industry; the advancements of technology have allowed medical professionals to deliver treatments with a greater level of accuracy, speed and efficiency than ever before. It has improved our lifestyle, supported knowledge, and had a major impact on our economy. 

In conclusion, technology has had innumerable positive effects on humanity. The internet has made it easier than ever before to access information from across the globe, allowing students and researchers to broaden their understanding and learn from the collective knowledge of our species.

Last but not least, technology has a major impact on our economy. For example, the use of automated machines for patient diagnostics, and surgical robots, has allowed for a more precise and detailed diagnosis compared to older traditional methods. With the advent of the internet, access to vast amounts of information is now literally at our fingertips. Automation has allowed businesses to increase their productivity and efficiency in an incredibly cost-effective manner, and the use of technology has had a major impact on how we conduct business on a global scale",1
"On the other hand, school-based learning can be time consuming and costly. 
There is no definitive answer to the question of whether attending classes in school or from home is the better choice. Furthermore, because virtual classes are more cost effective, they may also offer the chance to save money on tuition and transportation costs. Both methods of learning come with their own benefits and drawbacks, and it is important to consider both before making a decision.. Students can learn at their own pace from the comfort of their own home, as well as from various locations. On the downside, it can be more challenging to stay motivated without the in-person energy and capacity for interaction with a teacher and peers. In addition, technical issues may arise during virtual classes such as low-quality audio or video. It can also be easier to understand complex concepts via direct instruction from an experienced teacher, as well as the ability to get immediate responses to any questions asked. Each method of learning comes with its own advantages and drawbacks. Additionally, it can be difficult to stay focused when learning in a classroom setting, due to the distractions of other students.

On the other hand, attending classes virtually can offer more flexibility and convenience. 

In the end, the decision of whether or not to attend classes in person or virtually will depend on the individual’s preference and lifestyle. 

Attending classes in person has the benefit of being able to socialize and network with peers in addition to the formal education",1
"so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. they not prepared for the world students in high school don't have any experience of any career.

I think is a little to early. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career.

As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. One topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new",0
"Additionally, it could offer a structure that encourages scholastic success, since those students who are motivated to achieve higher grades would be rewarded with chances to participate in school activities. 
Implementing a policy where any student receiving a grade of less than a C in class would be excluded from participating in school activities could have several benefits for students and teachers alike. For students, such a policy might provide an incentive to take their studies more seriously as there would be direct and immediate consequences for below-average grades. 

For teachers, this policy could mean lower stress levels and a more productive learning environment. Not only would the teacher be able to focus on quality instruction rather than attempting to encourage a struggling student, but the other students would also be more engaged in their learning, encouraged by the absence of any disruption caused by a student with below-average grades.

Ultimately, by communicating the consequences of underperforming in their classes, a policy like this could be an effective tool for improving both student performance and overall school environment.",1
"Since all the work will be the same the students can look things up online. Getting all the answers from the internet and being able to just cheat off friends. It could still be a big distraction for the students.

The reason why i believe it can be bad for their learning enviorment. It would so get the students for envoled. The teacher-designed project will have work thats equal to your grade. It can also help them learn more as much as not help them learn more because students who actually do their own work and choose good questions for the project can help them be successful. Students will find the school work difficult for them since all they did during the summer was choose easy assignments for th project and cheat off of each other. Each student or group would have different kind of project so students can have their own work.

Yes student-designed projects would be cooler for the students to have their own project and not be assigned one. Students copying from friends causes students to learn less. The students would be able to pick their own type of questions in the project. Although student-designed projects isn't a horrible idea, because students would pay attention more to the assignment since their putting effort of their own into it. They will not be ready for the beggining of the school year. In conclusion i think teacher-designed projects for the summer is far more successful for the students than letting them do their own designs, because of the lack of effort is going to be put in if they do student-designed project and the amount of similar project they'll be from cheating off of each other.                                 . But there is just too many students who would cheat and not give effort to the project. Causes them not being envolved in the assignment. But at the same time student-designed project can effect them learning more,because all the assignments will be the same. Putting in type of effort to the student-designed project.

Teacher-designed projects will be outstanding for the students. Not make it too easy but also not too hard. The teacher can possibly let the students have partners and it'll be more exciting for them. Those questions can be really easy for them and picj it for the less work.

For example since the students will be not learning very much during the summer",0
"Before deciding to take on the challenge of finishing high school in three years, students should consider the pros and cons carefully.. Students may find themselves feeling increased fatigue from coming early and staying late in order to be able to complete the required courses. 

However, there are some drawbacks to finishing high school in three years. Finishing high school in three years can also better prepare students for college, as they may be able to take college classes as early as the end of their junior year. There are many advantages to this accelerated approach, such as being able to take classes before and after school in order to cover the content more quickly, and the ability to forego taking elective courses in order to focus on core courses. Additionally, students may be missing out on important developmental experiences which can come from taking elective classes and socializing with peers during lunch and other in-school activities. 
It is becoming increasingly popular for high school students to complete high school in three years, instead of the traditional four-year model",1
"We can share ideas and create solutions that are more creative than what one person could come up with alone. 

In conclusion, working in a group is a great way to break down complex problems into manageable parts, create solutions more quickly, and find solutions that may be better than what any one person could come up with alone.. Furthermore, if a member of the group gets sick, on vacation, or is otherwise unable to continue work, the other members can seamlessly continue due to the collective knowledge of the group. Most importantly, working in a group allows for more support and understandings of concepts; we can talk about our problems and come up with solutions more quickly when we are working together. 
Working in a group has many tangible benefits. By combining different perspectives and information, a group can form a more complete understanding than any one individual could",1
"Setting goals and developing a plan to reach them is a great way to stay committed and motivated. Finally, it's important to stay positive, as having a positive outlook makes it easier to stay focused and motivated.. After identifying their goal, individuals should break it into smaller achievable goals, and create a timeline or roadmap. There are countless successful people who testify to this fact. For example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, is a famous example of someone who used his positive attitude to propel him to success. His strategy was to stay focused and to have faith in himself and the projects he was working on—despite facing many obstacles along the way. Hard work and perseverance are also essential to success. 
Developing a positive attitude is a key factor in achieving success in life",1

Allowing students to use their phones during class can bring about many educational benefits which aid in fostering an enriching learning environment. Furthermore, students can use their phones to snap photos of course materials and diagrams for future reference. By allowing these students to access their phones in moderation during class, they are able to stay on top of their studies and stay productive. There is no denying that there are certain drawbacks to allowing phones to be used in schools, such as potential for distraction and abuse of technology. I therefore believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage is the most beneficial for our students.. 
As our school's principal, I'm sure you are aware of the rising issue of phone usage in classrooms. Fortunately, I believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage can bring more benefits than drawbacks to our students.

For starters, many students use their phones for organizational purposes, such as setting reminders of upcoming assignments and activities. This will help to promote a more academic and organized atmosphere in our classes.

Additionally, using phones can be a great educational resource. Through apps and websites, students have access to a wealth of information which can foster greater student engagement and facilitate more meaningful class discussions",1
"For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.

I try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. Successes comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.

When you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money",0
"Further, it is worthwhile to investigate if there are any graduation policies in school related to a minimum GPA.. 
Graduating early from high school is becoming increasingly more attainable. Another option to support the aim of graduating early is to bring up your GPA by taking extra classes, participating in sports, or switching courses with the help of your teachers. It is also important to evaluate the pros and cons of working during high school, as this can be an effective way to prepare for adulthood but it can also impact the amount of time spent on serious academic work. Students can take advantage of various resources, such as online classes, summer school, and staying after school for extra help, to gain a head start on their future",1
"So eduction help to learn about know technalogy, and technalogy helps to make life easier also connected with other easily. but still some people think's that it's not helpful to have the advance system of technalogy.

Minority of people misconstrue about technalogy because they never used the advance technalogy or they might be used it but they never realize because at some points there are some how people should be aware of how to should use it, and it all need knowledge that some people doesn't have that so it's really hard for them to use it.

Technalogy might be useful to comunicate with people but sometimes it's hard for those group of people that doesn't have the knowledge how to use it, get benfite from it. secientestes people who find out after alots of research that technalogy is the best way to persuad people connect with each other. Technalogy is the line that get the world people's in the cirlce, and create a group that make cummunication oaver cyber way by saving their time also best way of connection between people it make it really easy to people who are far away from each other by taking seconds to contact them.        .

"One such side effect is that people are slowly losing their ability to think for themselves. Instead of relying on our own problem-solving abilities, we are increasingly relying on technology to do things for us. If we are not careful, our current generation and future generations may suffer because of it.. 

Technology has undoubtedly become an integral part of our way of life. 
In the modern technological world, it is hard to ignore the potentially negative impact that technology has had on our lives. With the ability to access the internet and social media from wherever we are, a large portion of our days are now spent aimlessly browsing. While technology has revolutionized how we live, the side effects cannot be overlooked. This has led to many people becoming dependent on technology as a mental crutch, and caused us to lose our ability to think independently.

Another way that technology has negatively impacted our lives is how it has become both an addiction and a distraction. 

The exponential growth of technology over the past decade has meant that technology is now everywhere. As an example, the many online banking sites and financial calculators available have become the norm, as opposed to manually calculating and budgeting ourselves. However, it is important to recognize the negative effects that it can have, as this may lead to us losing the ability to think for ourselves and be self-reliant. This addiction has significantly reduced the amount of time that we are spending thinking and reasoning for ourselves",1
"On the other hand, schools controlling a student's participation in extracurricular activities can bring an element of structure to the student's life and ensure that activities are consistent with the school's values and goals. This approach gives students the opportunity to explore a variety of interests while also ensuring that their extracurricular activities are aligned with the school's values.. Furthermore, students can use their time in extracurricular activities to engage with their peers, build relationships, and explore their talents. 
Allowing students to choose their own extracurricular activities offers many potential benefits, including the ability to pursue passions and develop skills that may otherwise be inaccessible. While this approach may help students discover new interests or discover a career path, it does limit a student's potential to explore and develop their own passions. In my opinion, schools should provide guidance to students on what constitutes a healthy and beneficial extracurricular activity, while also allowing space for students to explore activities that interest them",1
"Students need to communicate with others to gain more experience.

a lot of students needs help with one person to support them with their work. They communicate with others share their thoughts. If their having problems with their assignment they can ask for help.

however some students are not agree to come to school because they might not like to wake up early every morning or deal with others. Because is more helpful for them they get help from their teachers. Some students are not smart enough to work by their-self. I think students should not be able to take classes at home. Sometimes students dont know how to do their assignment assigned. But it is more important to come to school because it benefits you gain more experience.. Some students have bad attitudes and they dont like been with others or forced to talk. If students take classes at home they might have some issues.

For example from my point of view I think students should come to school. Because is not going to benefit them with their work",0
"Fake news can misinform and mislead people, which can lead to social misunderstandings and false impressions. Online trolling usually involves malicious remarks and hurtful language, which can make individuals of any age feel insecure. 

In terms of the classroom, being surrounded by digital screens can make it difficult for students to engage in face-to-face communication. Technology can make it difficult for students to interact both in the physical space of the classroom as well as with one another on an emotional level. This can manifest itself in disruptive behavior, such as students talking over one another in conversations or physical aggression. This increased access to technology has brought with it both advantages and disadvantages in the social dynamic, especially for the younger generations. 

Moreover, the ease of access to the internet can also make individuals particularly vulnerable to online bullying. 

In recent years, technology has become an integral part of our lives, with many of us constantly connected to the online world through our phones, tablets, and laptops. Strategies such as providing students with access to mental health services, emphasizing the importance of in-person interaction, and encouraging digital literacy can help to some extent. Despite trying to ignore the comments out of fear, she became increasingly isolated as her peers began to ostracize her. Ultimately, it is important for teachers and parents to strive for a balance between technological use in the classroom and fostering physical interaction.. 

Given the sheer complexity of the issue, it is important to explore different methods to reduce the detrimental impact of technology on students' social skills. One example is that of Sarah, a young student, who was cyber-bullied by her peers for her choice of clothing. 

The prevalence of online trolling and fake news can also add to the mental stress and social burden of those who use the internet",1
"Researching occupations, talking to individuals in the field, and attending workshops and programs are all viable options for identifying a career. Committing to a career at a young age can grant more time to specialize in a chosen field, providing a competitive advantage along the way.. Additionally, examining the stories and examples of others who have chosen their career paths can be exceptionally beneficial in providing insight and direction. Despite the potential risks, devoting oneself to a field of study early on may grant additional time to research and develop the skills that are necessary for success. 
Choosing a career at a young age can offer certain benefits, such as increased focus and determination, as well as the opportunity to plan accordingly for future milestones. 

Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide how and when to commit to a career. Students in high school should take advantage of the resources available to them to explore and discover potential career paths",1
"I think that getting guidance from experts could help make decisions better because most people look and ask for guidance on a lot of things most of them are on decisions to make whether it's a good or bad decision to make.

I have asked people for guidance on decisions i remember i asked my old teacher if i should move to the U.S or stay in my country Generic_City. He told me that it would be better to move to the U.S because i would have more chances of being successful over there than staying in Generic_City and that i would have a better life too and that was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made in my life because i was leaving friends and family behind and i didn't want that to happen.

I have been asked for help before, my friend one day she called me and asked me to help her on her relationship i could tell that she needed help and guidance i could her it in her voice they got into this argument and she told me that it wasn't the first time they have argued before and she told me that it got to this one point that it made her cry so i told her that she needs to break up with him and that he wasn't good for her and if she keeps dating him the argument's could get worse what if he starts getting violent with her and stuff. People who have self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. I told her that it's going to be hard but it's for the best.

People ask for help when they need it or when they want it , However some people may not agree with me because they value their self-reliance and trust their instincts, they think that they should keep their personal problems to themselves but eventually those people are going to start having this feeling like they should talk about it to somebody and ask for their guidance because the same thing happened to me i didn't like telling people what was going on with my life later on i started feeling like i needed to talk to somebody about my decisions and i started to ask my family and friends for guidance. It's not bad to talk to ask people for guidance it can help you make decisions easier.",0

Thinks get easy every day, Long time ago you had to attend to a regular school because there was no other way to attend to school and accomplish your career dream, But now we have new technologies that allow some school to give online classes from home, If you live far away from school and theres no way you can get to school faster and easily. by the other head in home school you can be with them during that time they dedicate to study, or even better if your schedule don't fit with the time they need to study, you can hire someone you have confidence with, To help you, In home school your child is not surround of bad children that can make your child feel depressed, So in this way you can see how your child is going in progress,

And I think this is one of the best decision you can take to enroll your child in a online school, Or even your self if you want to get your education higher, I think this is a big opportunity not just for child but for adults too, This schools online bright us a lot of benefices, For example those people who didn't finished their studies is not too late to continued, This benefices them because they can do it at the time they are available, And in a comfortable place, In my position I'd rather enroll in myself in online classes. You don't have to worry at all, Because now there are a lot of online web site that can give you an opportunities to you to accomplish your goal or your professional career, so I think this is a great opportunity for all of those people who never went to school and think is too late, Well is not, Online classes allow to accomplish their goals to every one, No matter what age if they are old or young they can do it whenever they want, And at the time they are available,

However, Some parents decided to enroll their children in a online school, Because they think thats better then to sent they to a regular school, In one point those parent are right because in a regular school you are not looking out their children, And they dont know what they are doing, Or even if they are in school or not, And also you dont know what class of friend does your child is hanging out with, Or if other children are bulling to your children,

In regular school you don't know whats going on,

But. Great opportunities for students to attend to classes from home by online way,

Well, Now a day with the new technology",0
"Additionally, these changes could interfere with the ability to find daycare, as many daycare centers close before a ten-hour school day is over. 

When considering the importance of family time and connections, extended school days could have many detrimental effects. Extended school days can create difficulty in scheduling daycare for young children, drastically cut into family time, and interfere with jobs that may require five-day work weeks. 

Overall, while there are potential benefits to conserving energy and resources, the implications of an extended school day should be carefully considered when considering the needs of families, jobs, and other responsibilities.. 
Making the switch from a five-day work week to four days with an extended school day could be a benefit for conserving energy and resources. This could also mean that the school day is not over until late in the evening after sports, clubs, and other extracurricular activities, limiting the amount of downtime and family time. However, this change could create a host of problems when considering the needs of family, jobs, and other responsibilities. It could restrict the amount of time parents are able to spend with their children and limit the opportunity to eat meals together or have meaningful conversations",1
"Good impression have a lot of good benefits with your social life. So the next time when you meet someone new its good to have a good impression.. Like if your in a sport team and your that one kid who always bragging about how good they are, people around you wont want to be around you if they know your always bragging and they will spread rumors about you and people will stop talking to you if they know you like talking about yourself and people wont want to be your friend. Sometime they people you had a bad impression of are usually the people you want to be chill with. Sometime you can change people impression of you if they get to know to know you.

if your first impression isnt good it can messed up they stuff you do in life like a job interview if you dont a good impression you may not get the job. I agree with this statement because its hard to change your first impression. Some kids at school have bad impression and people talk about them behind their back and their made fun of them for being weird. In life its best to have a good impression because it can help you through life with people you met before. If you move to new place and your going to a new school, your going to need to have a good impression to make new friends because if your new and a lot of people dont know you and if you do something weird or dumb everyone at your new school is gonna have a bad impression of you and that may cost you to make new friends and sometimes someone may bully you for being weird. If you meet someone and you do something weird theyre gonna remember you as that one weird kid. If you wanna ask out the girl you like and she heard you did something to a another girl, shes going to have a bad impression of you and she wont even want to talk you and your tried to ask her out shes gonna reject you.

First impressions are sometimes always hard to change if you dont try change it with the people you had a bad impressions with. it can be bad when someone have a bad impression of you when your trying to be their friend",0
"its a really bad idea coming from the principal. And something kids may not like the food from the beginning cause it may not be cooked right, or it may have the lunch lady hair in it, and lunch ladies should ware hair nets when they cook the food in the morning and after noon.

And this should be for the bananas too if they don't look good you should throw it away and some other food it are past days. . it would be better just too leave the food alone and let people enjoy it. And Chips or other snacks shoudn't be taking away either mostly poeple like snacks more then food. Taking out the student favorite food shouldn't be taking out cause a lot of kids wont even come to school cause of the lunch and but if there different kinda food it would maybe make kids love lunch more. well a lot of kids dont care about what they eat only if its good",0
"Without their vision, we wouldn’t have access to lightning-fast communication and other tools that rely upon the power of imagination.

Imagination can also be credited with our ability to progress culturally and spiritually. It allows us to reshape our reality and pursue a better tomorrow. Imagination encircles the world.” This statement speaks to the power of imagination and its ability to stretch beyond circumstances and possibilitites of the physical. Knowledge is limited. When we embrace imagination, it helps us envision paths to personal growth and transformation. It is more important than knowledge because it enables us to find creative solutions to our problems, build upon our wins, and become wiser as a collective. Knowledge may guide us through life, but imagination can help us envision a better world. 

Ultimately, imagination is more important than knowledge because it is the spark that triggers creativity, discovery, and progress. 

For instance, the technological advances of the 20th century would have been impossible if it hadn’t been for the imaginations of inventors like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. It can constantly inspire us to think bigger and better, to uncover new insights and explore our own potential. 
Albert Einstein famously said “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Without it, our ambition to learn and grow our potential would be limited. 

In many respects, imagination is the tool with which we build the future. Through our imagination, we can rewrite the rules and design the future.",1
"I have heard that many people gets bully by others people sometimes, and which is I don't understand, why this it happens probably for the color of you're skin and we all are the same just the color of the skin is different. Or can be other reason why they bully other people, which is people who gets bully they could kill themselves about getting bullied by other ones and thats a bad situation.

But those bad people they keep on bulling they don't stop until something happens and I ask my self why? this happens sometimes, probably its because we are different than they are or they feel more stronger than other ones or can be any other reason probably they are rich they have more money than other people, probably thats why bulling someone is not nice it could cause bad things to you.

And I understand that its hard for those people who are suffering about bulling, and its hard to support all that when you get bullied for someone, when you bullied i thin k is not for some reason and its horrible for those people who gets bullied by someone, I think thats something that those people who are bulling they should stop bulling those poor people.

What should we do about bulling collaborate to stop we should stop because, it can cause bad situation to those people who are bulling other they can go to jail for the reason they make fun of others, why they can go jail because those poor people who are getting bullied they could kill themselves and thats why they can go to jail its a bad thing thats what can happen to them if they don't stop bulling           ",0
"Do you want to know some enjoyable ways to do at the park? Well, at the park you can walk your dog, you can have a picnic with family or friends, some parks have animals you can look at, and you can ride your bike, skate board, and scooter.

One enjoyable thing to do at the park is, you can walk our dog. It's also fun because the dog can explore new places to go to.

Also it's somewhere you can take your dog to go out and enjoy nature with you. Also you and your dog can have some time together.

Another enjoyable way to do at the park is, you can have a picnic with your family of friends. If you brought someone with you and they never been there before then they might like it and they would want to come back again.

Third enjoyable way to do at the park is, some parks have animals you can look at. The park is also a safer place because there won't be a lot of cars. You can also go look at the pig races. There could be some animals you may have never seen before. Sometimes when you go see the animals at the park some people can tell you some stuff to learn about the animal like where is is from or what it eats and you can feed the animal food that the park provides them to eat.

Last but least, you can ride your bike, stake board, and scooter. Having picnics at the park can be good for example, the weather when it is hot or warm or it is a beautiful day outside. At the park you can learn how to ride the the thing you brought and practice. While you are riding on what you brought with you, it is fun to ride it while you see the beautiful features of the park. Having a picnic is fun because you get to talk to the person with you and eat with them. It is a good place to go and play with your friends with bikes, skate boards, and scooters because the park is safer than the street and might be a big park to play at with your friends.. It is enjoyable to look at the animals for example, the bears, fishes, turtles, goats, chickens, and pigs. When you are done with your picnic you can go and explore more of the park. Some dogs like walking, so a park is a good place to take them to go walk. While you are walking your do, you are also getting some exercise by walking with them",0
"As I practiced and explored these instruments, I began to participate in musical contests, concerts, and any other opportunity to showcase my talents. My hard work paid off when I became the leader of a school band, and we wrote and performed a song for an important event. 
My love of music started when I joined the school choir in elementary school. I was curious about different types of instrument, and soon began to learn the recorder, xylophone, percussion, and the violin. Music has been a passion of mine ever since.. I was proud to have contributed to something so meaningful",1
"It is important to manage time effectively in order to make time for practicing, however a good diet can also help. 
Excerpt:

Without proper sleep and nutrition, students can suffer from serious health complications that could impair their ability to practice and compete in games. For students with busy family and school commitments, stress and fatigue can interfere with their ability to practice for a game. Eating healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients to maximize energy and focus for game practice.",1
"Though dedication and diligence played a large part in his success, Jefferson also believed that experiences shape us into more successful, knowledgeable people. He understood that careful planning and taking initiative could lead to greater accomplishments. Ultimately, it all comes down to individual responsibility as to which approach is taken, and that diligence is important to strive for success.. 
Thomas Jefferson was an American statesman, diplomat and Founding Father whose meticulous planning and diligence were hallmarks of his successes. While some may favour the latter, believing that open-mindedness and curiosity can lead to greater growth as individuals, the former may argue that having a plan and executing it carefully can make us more successful, independent, and secure. Experiences can challenge us, refine our capabilities, and help us become more valuable and proficient.

The debate between whether living diligently or more opportunistically leads to greater happiness has been discussed for centuries",1
"Arguments for and against the use of cell phones in the classroom can be found on both sides of the discussion. Additionally, text messaging, email, and other online communication tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between students and teachers. Smart phones are also able to capture photos and videos that students can use for research projects.

On the other hand, cell phone use in the classroom has shown to be distracting to both students and teachers. Cellphones can be used to cheat on tests, watch videos, or send messages if not monitored properly. . The benefits of technology must be balanced with the possible negative impacts to ensure a safe and productive learning environment. 

Overall, the effects of cell phone use in the classroom will depend heavily on the policies and administration monitoring their use. 
Cell phones have become integral elements of modern life, so it is no surprise that their use in the classroom has been receiving much attention. Additionally, too much reliance on cell phones can lead to students not learning the material in-depth. 

Positively, cell phones can offer many benefits to the learning process, enabling students to access information quickly and easily. Many schools and universities have varying policies surrounding the use of cell phones in learning environments, ranging from complete bans to learning scenarios that include cell phone use",1
"For those juggling multiple responsibilities, such as jobs, summer break is a vital opportunity to catch up on rest, spend time with family, and plan for the upcoming school year. Furthermore, shortening the summer break would make it difficult for students to break from their habits, explore new interests, and gain the perspective and balance they need to be successful. 
Summer break is an important time for students to recharge and refocus after a busy school year. With no break, they may become burned out and overwhelmed trying to manage both their academic and personal lives. It gives them a much needed respite from academic pressures, a precious chance to relax, and the opportunity to pursue hobbies and interests that are not always available during the rest of the year. Taking away the summer break could also put students' mental health at risk. We must recognize the value of summer break for students and oppose any efforts to reduce it significantly.",1
"Think about it.     . For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home.

Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine.

They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home.

After school many students might have something to do or attend. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away.

In conclusion The school board shouldn't add an extra hour and a half to each school. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. And,their wouldn't be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they won't be late. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time",0
"Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what they're working towards the same goal. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills.

However,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome.

Personally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal.

Group work isn't always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,It's more of letting people get their thoughts out. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isn't bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. This helps expands the thought process as many can see a different perspective on things. Therefore if you have communication you don't have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes I'm here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!. It's actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didn't even know they could think of such thing,that's why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think they're too good for everyone. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient.

I have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. Also a group is not always a maximum group of 5-7 people it can also be about just 3 maybe even two.

Group work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well that's okay but wouldn't you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldn't you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things",0
"

Other approaches such as conflict resolution training and restorative justice show far greater promise in helping children recognize their mistakes and resolve conflicts without resorting to harmful behaviors. While it may send the message that the children's actions have significant consequences, it usually results in further disconnection and isolation rather than long-term behavioral changes. Conflict resolution training teaches children how to recognize, express, and resolve feelings, while restorative justice allows them to reconcile with the people they've hurt and take responsibility for their actions.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to curbing evil behavior in children, there is evidence to suggest that conflict resolution and restorative justice are some of the most effective methods available. 
Recent studies suggest that separating children from their relatives in an effort to diminish their tendency to perform evil acts is an ineffective approach. These strategies create an environment of understanding and communication, encouraging children to work through their problems and build better relationships.",1
"Furthermore, I know that attending college and getting the qualifications I need will maximize the potential of my educational opportunities and open up a world of possibilities.. 

Growing up, my parents have always supported my academic pursuits and inspired me to strive for excellence. This thought is daunting, because I am aware of the financial and personal commitments such a choice will require. I understand that to get the job I want in the future, I need to pursue higher education to develop my skills. As I reflect on this inspiring influence, I recognize that completing college will be a key factor in my feeling successful and secure in the future.

"
The shift to a four-day school week is becoming more and more common among schools across the country. However, there are also some disadvantages to consider, such as added stress on teachers, students having to attend longer school days on the four days when school is in session, and limiting extracurricular activities due to the shortened school week. Research and further discussion are needed in order to determine whether or not extending the school day two hours is a feasible idea for students.. It can be beneficial in terms of saving money on transportation and utilities, improving academic results, and allowing teachers and staff to gain additional professional development opportunities while school is not in session. 

Extending the school day two hours for students to gain additional academic instruction is an idea that is gaining traction. While this could be beneficial as it would provide additional instruction time, it would also mean that students would have to attend longer school days and would require more funding in order to staff the additional teaching hours",1
"Students can come up with their own checklist and show their classmates how they came up with it so the other students can do it one day for fun.

In conclusion, these our my reason why i think students should design their own summer projects.. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. I think students should come up with their own summer projects design because, students can come up with really creative projects, could have more fun doing their own design projects,and will have less stress over the summer.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others.

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Students could also can work on a project with their friends.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone",0
"Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them.

Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasn't a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don't have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases.

As a student I desagree with this option. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who won't take this seriously.

I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don't have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren't prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn't do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes.

My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can't happen because we are the future.

In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.",0
"They believed that if you work on something every day, eventually you will succeed. Their lives have provided us with numerous examples of how constant work and effort can help you reach your goals. This supports the popular saying, “Practice makes perfect.”. Research shows that the more effort you put into something, the more likely you are to experience positive results. 
Many great inventors, such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, have attributed their success to hard work and persistence. Inactivity allows you to be creative and thoughtful when it comes to your work. 

These examples demonstrate how important hard work and practice are when it comes to achieving success. 

Furthermore, staying still and inactive can sometimes be beneficial as well. Similarly, many companies have achieved success by continuously striving to improve their products, services, and processes. It can give you time to reflect on your work, consider ideas, and devise a plan of action",1
"Depending on the severity of the offense, legal penalties can range from fines to jail time. 
The potential consequences of disobeying curfew for teenagers can be severe depending on the city or state where the curfew is being enforced. As an alternative to legal penalties, parents can choose to impose other forms of discipline such as discussion, restriction of privileges, or other punishments. Ultimately, it is important that parents and teens understand the consequences of breaking curfew and take the necessary steps to ensure it is followed.. For those who live in a city or state that does not have a statutory curfew, breaking curfew can still result in consequences from the parents such as restricted access to cars and phones, fewer privileges, or grounding. If the curfew is established by law, then it is punishable by law",1
"People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. I hope this helps you with your every day situation.. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. Community parks has it all open space, sun ,green grass, tables and a nice setting in general.

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. his sibling are loud he can't focus. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams",0
"

By trusting my gut and focusing on my true goals, I have been able to take the necessary steps to succeed in my education and beyond. 
Growing up, I was constantly told what I should do with my life. I have found that it is essential to listen to those around you, while also giving yourself the freedom to make your own decisions. However, over time, I've learned that it's important to stay true to myself and focus on my own goals, regardless of what the world says. From parents to teachers to my peers, I felt like the world was trying to direct me in my own path. Everyone had an opinion – choose this career, don't get too many tattoos, go to the right college – and I felt like I had to follow what I was told. 

For example, when I was deciding on a college major, I felt like I had to stick with a ""traditional"" degree, such as engineering or business. It may be difficult to go against the current, but in the end it is worth it if you remain true to yourself and your own goals.. But deep down I knew that I wanted to pursue a degree in the humanities, an area that many people have often deemed as ""unrealistic."" In the end, I decided to take a risk and completely forgo the advice of others, embracing my love of literature instead",1
"When working alone, one has more time to gain insight and understanding as there is no need to engage with others, allowing you to focus on the goal. Success outcomes are more likely to be achieved when working alone as there is no getting caught up in unnecessary arguments or delayed decision making. Furthermore, when working alone, there is no need to compromise in order to accommodate opinions of others. Finally, working alone helps increase confidence as you are solely responsible for the outcome of the project and can measure your own capabilities.

When we consider the advantages of working alone, it is clear that it can provide great value when it comes to developing knowledge and understanding, as well as leading to success.. 
Working alone has many benefits that may be overlooked when compared to working in a group. This freedom allows you to push your boundaries and be creative as you see fit. For starters, working alone can help to echo back and refresh knowledge by teaching yourself through your own projects. Moreover, there is no need to share ideas or credit, as all ownership remains solely yours",1
"At the same time, students must also put in more effort to complete the same amount of material within the shorter schedule, and teachers must adjust their plans more often.

The school board must also take into account the effects of a year-round schedule in terms of preparation for tests. 
Year-round education and the traditional school approach both have their advantages and disadvantages. It may be difficult for students to remember what they learned after an extended break, and the shortened break periods of a year-round approach may require more frequent testing that could add to the stress levels of students.

In summary, while year-round education can lead to increased student retention and engagement, the increased effort and frequency of testing can lead to more stress and difficulty for students and the school board. On the one hand, year-round education can result in a greater retention of material for students, since the breaks between classes are shorter and students are able to stay engaged and motivated to learn for longer periods of time. Careful consideration is needed to determine which approach best suits a given school's circumstances.",1
"Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment.  . Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school",0
"A trustworthy person who can help the team be better and cooperate positively.

No employer would hire someone who can't be at work in time, someone who always finds excuses to stay at home, someone who can't accept to be wrong.

I remember the way I was raised. She is my model. I will not say I am the ""Albert Einstein'' of this generation but, I am intelligent , fast learner, humble and cooperative. Employers need to know that they can rely on this person in rough time. My mother died. I might not be the most experienced person for this work, but I am a good candiade.. I have known how it felt to be miserable, dependent, be rejected, to count on someone, to fail again and again.

Even though I did not go to college, I am proud of myself. She did not have the chance to see the fruit of her hard-work.

I want to make her pride from where she is. In my country, Haiti, school is very expensive and not accessible for everyone. As she always said, '' Je me leve a l'aube du jour et m'endorme apres le couche du soleil pour que tu sois fiere de toi meme, et sois capable d'aider les gens comme moi. Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. Because she was a hard-worker. I can read, write, and speak not only one language but, 3 different ones.

I have learned to offer the better side of me in anything I am doing. "" I graduated high school with advanced diploma. My mother do not know how to read just because her parents were poor. Responsible and hard-worker people are the top choosen. But, I had this opportunity because my mother made the impossible become possible",0
"Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.

When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and don't have distractions all year. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn.

some people prefer to take classes from home or online. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. . I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision",0
"
The success of a program in a school can have a significant impact on student relationships, teamwork, and trust. This can lead to stronger connections in the community, greater self-confidence, and the foundation for a successful future.. When teams are formed, the value of solidarity and working together towards a common goal increases, allowing everyone to benefit from each other’s unique skills. When students are working together towards a common goal, it can lead to relationships that are more collaborative and trusting. This is especially true when it comes to programs that are designed to foster collaboration and team work. This trust can carry over to other areas of life and can create a stronger student community.

Finally, participation in a program can also lead to greater self-esteem and confidence. Friendships can be formed among students who are part of a successful program, and this relationship can lead to greater collaboration and success outside of the program.

In addition to fostering interpersonal relationships, participating in a program can also encourage teamwork and trust. This confidence can carry over into other areas of life, such as their relationships with family and friends, or in their abilities inside or outside of the classroom.

Overall, participating in a program has the power to make positive changes in student relationships, teamwork, and trust. By achieving success as a team, students gain a deeper sense of self-esteem and gain the tools they need to build their team skills and trust in others. By working together, students can better communicate their strengths and weaknesses and learn to trust each other",1
"Because if you find a programs that can help you, so you can follow what you want to do it in a future.

If you are a bad students and you GPA is so down you can`t go to the college becuase for going to college, I think you GPA have to do more the 3.00 for you can go a good callege.

Thats why I think is good take the high school in three year, because you can have more oportunidis for well have a good future.

Conclution.

Yes is good idea that students to finish high school in three years becuase is something like well better for you futuere, in your live. because the education is very important.. But everything is your decision you know what you want to do with life and if you don`t know what you want to do just think about in you future and thats you can find the enswer and belive in yourself that you can do it. I thinks is decions of everyone because if you are smart and if you want to graduation in three year just you have to focuse and give your best and you have the decion in your hands if your decion is yes so do it, because another students can`t do it or din`t like, so i think is opecional, for my selfel i think is greet idea just take three year of the high school but i know is not easy becuase take the high school in three year is very complicate becuase you well have to take course duging the summers and may not be able to take elective couses, but you advance is good.

Reasons. (why is good)

Examples of kindness:

Opening a door.

Giving compliments.

Helping someone with bag's.

asking about their day.

Impact on other people:

The impact on other people can be so important that even can save lives! and example of that can be that if you notice someone that is passing trough bad moments but you doun't know how to help the simple act of kindness of asking ""how is your day?"" can actually help that person by knowing that someone cares about him/her. . Other ways that the small act's of kindness can change things is by making a person do good things for others. For example, if you help someone with bags, they will see how that little help makes them feel, that will make them do it for someone else or even back to you. ~Aesop said: ""

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. The hole point of this is to make people know the importance of doing little act's of kindness and to show how you can do it",0
"Everytime one of the members in my family would try to talk to him it would be like he was zonned out; he just would not listen. Technology is something many people use in their daily lives, I belive technology has definintly made an imppact on people over time. Children are the worst when it comes to doing things for yourself, which is why there is technology to help you out, you can do online shopping for grocieries, clothing, exc without having to leave the comfort of your own home.

In conclusion, technology overall has its ups and down, there are times where it can be beneficial and there are also times where it can be a distraction but it has definetly helped in the past in many ways one really big one is hospitals, technology has saved many lives and helped alot of familys so it really depends how you use technology for it to actually be benefitial. Another negative impact this was would be that my little brother would yell when someone tried taking his Ipad away and thats when my parents knew it was a very huge problem, so they decided to put his Ipad away for a while as well as our electronics or atleast keep them out of his sight and over time I got my little brother back and my parents got their son back.

Secondly, technology can distract people in many negative ways, one way is safey, you could be walking, driving, on a boat it does not matter, but if you're on your phone and not aware of your surrounding, or not paying mind to them, than you could get hurt. It's not good to take advantage of it, you have to use your brain as much as you can, people depend on technology too much and that's what causes problems. Another reason in why it would be negative is the children using technology.        . Phones, cell phones, laptops, tv's have all been upgrated during the past couple of years, technology can effect us in both negative and positive ways but i belive that their are more negative's than positive's.

One reason I belive technology has more of a negative impact is because it causes a lack of communication with friends and with family, I myself have witnessed and expirinced this. Children can become more obsesed with electronnics than most teenagers and adults, I have a little brother that recived an ipad as a gift from my parents whe he was only three years old, only because he would'nt let my mother use her cell phone in peace, getting that ipad might have been the biggest mistake thats my parents could have made. Some ways that technology has been beneficial is if you work in a job that requires you to have a computer or laptop to make work easier, or having a busy work schedule that you can type into your phone and it would alert you about the things you have to get done. Their have been many reports on people getting in car accident or getting hit all because they were not paying attention, but overall their have been more incidents while driving.

There are some ways that technology has also been benefial to us. My little brother (when he recived the Ipad) stopped playing with his toys, stopped watching his favorite show which was spongbob, stopped eating as much and also stopped listening to direction and became rebelious. Another benefial way that technology has helped is shopping! eveybody loves shopping but somtimes you can't go out and do some shopping for yourself becuse maybe its been a long week and your exausted from work or you're injured, as well as having children",0
"when they get a jod were they have to do team work it won't be so hard because they already now how to communicate and show team work.

STUDENT_NAME. Many students might change schools because they want to be in a team. sport's teach diciplean and team work witch will help in their future live when they grow up. Dear: principal

I think that the policy is unfair because not all the students have a B range and they want to be in a sport team or other thing.

I why don't you change the policy to C' s. If not the team' s are not going to be complete and the school could lose all the games",0
"So there was students how was older then me and the help me where was my classroom because i was getting losed in school and every time when i was getting in to boy bathroom there were showed me where was girl bathroom and they were helped me how to speak English.

The older students are available to assist the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something. . for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

Finally to shows the younger s how to do something, older student can be helpful when you need help they can help you. to ilistued. when i came to America i was in third grade i was new and i didn'et know what are the school rules and i didn'et know any thing about school and also i did'net know how to speak English. Many people think that older students can be helpful to the younger students on the other hand many people think that the older student can not be helpful to the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject",0
"No one want to live their life with the negative way that not good for everyone, their family, and everyone around them. When you touch your dream by hard-working, and you will know the challenge in the life make you grow up.

in conclusion, the success in life is can be base on the attitude you have, the positive is always good thing for your life, that make you life is easier don't make you life become too hard. For example you think you don't know or not good at anything, why you don't try it? whatever you are you still not doing great for the first time just do your best, you can do better for the next time, you will never know what you can until you try it, you believe you could and you did it. Or the long time no see they still remember you in the good memory, and not forget you make feel you important in the world everyone not forget you, that is the success in life.

I am very sure most of us learn from teachers and parents are always the positive way and positive attitude, they will not teach you some thing bad and negative, what is mean? That mean they want you to live the most happy you can because they know they can't go with you or following you forever.                  . They like you and when you get in trouble they will help try their best to help you without your money like the way you make them happy. Let thinking about that when you have positive attitude and good energy and give it to everyone first thing you got is people will love you because that make people feel comfortable when near by, they feel your positive energy you giving to them,and you will have a good friendship when you give them the best feeling they need after all the problem, stress in their life. Why people always say never give up or you don't know how far you can touch your dream, you think it very far away, some it next to you but you just don't take your chance and your time to finish your dream. The success not mean you become you must be rich or must become famous, you can think it the easy way is make yourself happy. The first of all you need make yourself happy, then you can make other people happy, finally don't give up make your life going up by your hard-working if you can do all of those thing you are successful not by your career or your money but by your good energy and positive attitude make it become success. The second thing is that make yourself happy, life is tired you will not happy if always have a negative attitude in life, no one can make you happy except yourself. The statement positive attitude is the key to success in life is true,the attitude is important in life. For example, when you rich but you not live positive attitude and people not respect you, love you, support you, or you always worry about your money, you get stress or some people always say they love you but for real they just love your money when become poor they will leave, I am sure you still not happy for that way.

People think they have very bad life and always think the worse thing that the negative attitude and it will go with you forever and you never have the better life, the life you want and you never become successful. The last one is some people think they are having very bad life, they always get the worse thing than other people, and they want to give up but if they looking around them they are not the one have the baddest life. Follow that way you will never become success.

When you do a good thing make everyone happy and you will feel like you are so cool, you are very good, anyway you will feel happy because you was did a good thing and when they happy they will give their love, their respect",0
"yes impression can be change based on your experiance or your attitude that you show to the people around you, we know everybody have a different impression, but in the different ways. you can be impression if you respect your self, be nice.

and to love other,example celebrity they do good things to impress us, after that they start have a impressoin to people, but if they acting badly to people they impressoin start finished, but if you be good or nice impressoin will come to you it not just to be famous that mean you gone have impressoin even if you not famous you can have impressoin, just you your kindness or help other nobody can,t take you impressoin or change it if you used it. in good ways, you can,t be impressoin if you fighting with people oall the time you can,t impressoin if you don't know how to talk nicely with people impression, person always is cool with people show people your impressoin prove it to them let thems see your impressoin because you can be success because of you impressoin nobody can't take you impression, nobody can't change exspect your self you are the only one can make your impressoin go away you can make people not to trust you but if you keep show tthem your good, impressoin in good way don't acting mean to other because you have impression, just you peole or the one you make that impression work to you...

"First of all, the student has more flexibility when it comes to their studies since they can set their own schedule for when they do their work. 

For students attending classes in-person, one great advantage is the social aspect. 
Excerpt: Online classes have become increasingly popular, offering students the option to study from home instead of attending school in person. Furthermore, online courses may not have the same level of resources as a more traditional learning environment. On the other hand, the lack of social interaction and the dependence on self-motivation can be drawbacks for students who are used to attending classes in-person. 

In conclusion, when deciding between online and in-person classes, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Additionally, students are not limited to their physical location as they can attend classes online from anywhere, making it easier for students who have limited access to physical classes. However, this type of learning may also be stressful for some students, as they have to adjust to the pressures of attending classes in a traditional environment.

Studying online has its advantages as well. They are able to form relationships with their peers and build social skills. Each individual student needs to consider their own personal preferences and skills to decide which option best suits their needs.. Furthermore, techniques such as hands-on learning and real-world application are utilized and can help students find practical solutions to their problems. There are advantages to both online and regular classes, and it depends on the individual student to determine which will be best for them",1
"Ultimately, honesty is the best path to ensure relationships are built on trust.. For example, if you make a mistake at work, it’s best to own up to it instead of trying to pass the blame. 

Many situations demonstrate when honesty is the best policy. 

Of course, there can be serious consequences of lying. If you are caught lying, even once, it will be incredibly difficult to regain someone’s faith in you and the truth going forward. Breaching somebody’s trust can hurt them and can take a long time to repair after an act of dishonesty. Being honest about your shortcomings demonstrates integrity and a sense of responsibility. It also shows that you are accountable for your actions and is far more likely to be viewed positively by colleagues than trying to save face. Trying to cover up lies can be damaging to relationships, as it erodes trust and can cause considerable distress. 
Honesty is essential in everyday life; it’s the foundation of any healthy relationship - be that with your family, friends, or colleagues. Honesty is an important factor in gaining trust from others as it shows that you are trustworthy and reliable",1
"Whether it's trying to beat a personal record or striving for a championship title, motivation can lead to personal successes and team victories. In sports, for example, motivation is integral to striving for the best performance. Whether it's reaching a dream job or saving for a purchase, using motivation to move consistently towards a goal can be key to lasting success. 
Motivation can play a key role in many aspects of life. Finally, motivation is essential for achieving life goals. Similarly, in professional settings, staying motivated can be a deciding factor in career success. Whether it's pushing your limits to move ahead in an organization or staying motivated to complete a project, maintaining dedication and enthusiasm can be key to making progress. In all these instances, motivation is a recurring factor that has the potential to make or break lifelong endeavors.",1
"Its also good to talk to the people that have been through your situation becase they have been through it and they can give you tips on how to be positive or how to be relaxed in that situition if it ever happens agian.

You can also talk to your familiy members becase they are are close people that you can always trust to help you like a project or just homework things like that so it doesent stress you out so much. Its good to know that someone will always be there to help you out. I think it better to talk to more people than just one person, why becase different people have a different way of viewing a situation. People act differnet, one person might be angry and the other might be happy. Thats one of the reasons why i think its better to talk to more people than just one person.

You can see how different poeple think by just starting a conversation, different people might have better advice than others becase of the way they think or how they were taught to do things. Thats way i think its better to talk do different people not just one person.

"As Jefferson once said, ""Never take more time and pains than is necessary for a thing - the genuine wisdom is in taking the shortest way."" It is important to find a balance between staying busy and taking time to rest to avoid feeling overwhelmed and overstressed. 
Thomas Jefferson believed that the key to getting tasks done was to strike a balance between constant work and rest. Taking time to rest was vital in order to refresh memories, perfect ideas, and help alleviate the temptation of overthinking small matters. By ensuring that one is taking the time to rest, it is easier to tackle tasks with the appropriate frame of mind and boost efficiency. Rest is essential to enable focused, intentional work.",1

I was very sad, however, my teacher told me that I had a second chance. in my oponion this cause happend to them or they are saing that because they loss their enthusiams and become weak person. seven month ago she called again to the airline and the prices tickests increase more money, but she didn't want to continue waiting more time so she decided to buy it, when she was buying the tickets the person told to her of her ID was already expire, so she can not buy the ticket. To fall out the test made me to understand that it doesn't matter how many times we can fall out about what we want, we only need to be strong and try as much as we can for being successful. also, they say when the person loss the first two times they're losers, stupy persons, or other bad things that are not right. I practiced a lot and I did my best for taking A+ or maybe B+, but I did pass the test. My aunt was sad because she did not remember about to renew her documents, but she went to renew her documents some weeks later and after that she has to wait at less three months to receive the new ID. even thoug she can't travel yet, she doesn't lose her enthusiasm of travel this year to my country. some people think this statement is not true because some of them loss multiple times for being successful in their life. in conclusion, for being successful we have to fall out in the life, like when i fall out my test and with my aunt cause",0

While there have been more traditional ways of taking classes throughout educational history, the emergence of online courses and virtual video conferencing have made it possible for busy students and those living far away from their desired schools to benefit from quality education. With no physical boundaries, educational opportunities are enabled for those who may not otherwise have access to them. 

Overall, taking classes online or through video conferencing can provide busy students and those interested in classes with more convenience. Additionally, online coursework provides the ability to access material from multiple resources, giving students a more in-depth understanding of the course. Virtual meetings with professors can ensure that the student remains engaged and is able to interact with their professor much in the same way as if they were in a physical classroom. This can also be beneficial for those who may not be able to attend traditional classes, such as those with physical disabilities. This can be highly beneficial for those with commitments that may prevent them from taking classes in a traditional setting, and can open up many learning opportunities for students.. 

For students living far away from their school, taking classes through video conferencing can provide many of the same advantages. While there may be specific deadlines for assignments, students can utilize the convenience of online to their advantage and submit work when it's most convenient for them. These classes present more convenience to those who have a baby or who need to go to work, allowing them to complete their coursework at their own pace and in the comfort of their own homes. 

In an online setting, students have the advantage of greater flexibility and being able to work around other commitments",1

I recently took some time to look inward and reflect on my interests and skills. Additionally, I will look for ways to apply my talents in real-world scenarios, such as submitting stories and articles to publications or giving speeches and presentations at events. After considering what I'm passionate about and what I excel at, I pinpointed two possible talents: creative writing and public speaking. To hone these talents, I plan to practice and develop my craft in various ways. I'm excited to explore my potential and further develop these two talents in the coming months.. Going forward, I will read up on writing and public speaking, join online courses or forums, and network with people in the writing and speaking industries",1

"With a little planning and effort, there are several strategies you can use to retain school information during your time away. You can also create flashcards with key concepts and topics and review them periodically throughout the vacation in order to keep the information fresh in your mind. 

Finally, any additional reading or research related to the topics you’ve been studying can also assist in retaining information. 
Vacations are much-needed breaks from the demands of school. Taking a fresh approach to a subject or exploring the same topic in a different way can help you to gain a deeper understanding of the material. 

An additional strategy is to make a game out of it – for example, you could create a quiz with friends or family about the material you’ve been studying or, if you’re the competitive type, you can create a scoring system to see who scores the highest. 

These are just a few of the strategies you can use to retain school information during a summer or spring break. This is a great way to make studying fun and engaging, while helping you remember the information for when you return to school. 

One effective strategy is to review the most important information the week before your break. This will help to refresh your memory, as well as ensure that you don’t forget any key points during your time off. With some planning and a little extra effort, you can ensure that you don’t forget the information you’ve been studying when you get back to school.. However, long breaks like summer or spring can make it difficult to retain information learned during the school year",1
"These are my reasons of why I agree with the famous Albert Einstein.

First of all, without an imagination you wouldn't have dreams to succeed. Imagination is like an opinion,no one can take that from you. But than I realized that soccer isn't very popular in America. I always want to be one step ahead from everyone. As a person that has dreams to succeed you need imagination to achieve them.

As one can see,me as a football player. I agree with this amazing quote because without imagination you wouldn't be yourself. Since than I've always imagine of being a professional football player.

Secondly, imagination is an everyday thing you use it everyday in many ways. As a kid everyone has always imagined of them being like or better then someone. I use my imagination a lot for many reasons. Like if I ever lose at something I would think about it and say ""imagine if I won"".

Lastly, the famous quote can say a lot in my opinion. The famous Albert Einstein always said ""Imagination is more important than knowledge"". Because without an imagination you wouldn't be a regular person.. Myself for example I've always wanted to be a professional soccer player. Because I am very competitive when it comes to sports, I always want to be better than the old me. So than i started playing football and I enjoy playing that sport very much. For that reason I think I use my imagination a lot. Imagination is everything because you always imagine or wish you were doing something or wish you were with someone. It can be positive nor negative either way no one can change the way you think",0
"Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. I disagree with what John Lubbock saids ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. For example if someones morals aren't made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work.

I get where Mr. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals.

As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. . I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character.

In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. Ones morals has a big role in character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character",0
"This helps them stay informed without having to constantly interact with other people. Furthermore, technology can help create an awareness of how news and events in the world can affect individuals personally, making them more cognizant of their environments. 

Overall, the use of technology to limit human contact has brought a positive impact on physical and mental health, as well as providing important information about the world. It has enabled people to lead more efficient, safer, and ultimately healthier lives.. 
In recent years, technology has been a great aid to humans in limiting contact with one another, especially during times of change or crisis. Those who participate in online social networks are capable of maintaining meaningful connections without the need to congregate in person, allowing them to stay safe and secure. Such use has helped to improve physical and mental health for individuals around the globe. 

Technology also allows users to keep up-to-date on world news. Individuals can regularly read about or watch news broadcasts that update them with the most recent information about news and events. As people limit their contact with each other, they limit their exposure to external factors that may disrupt their daily lives",1
"Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. We can do alot of things with out it. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Furthermore parents have to a limitation on their kids and put a limit on them.",0
"For example, if you live in Virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to Florida or any other place. After failing tests, having bad grades, your parents yelling at you for it, pressuring you to do better, and having other things to deal with that will make you have stress. If you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there. It is best to just keep it the way it has always been. Also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. You will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. Having long summer breaks also results in a lot of solutions for people. . It is important for students to be able to have a long summer break so they can get their minds off in a lot things and have less stress.

Overall, having a long summer break means people will run out of things to do there should still be a long break because people go on vacations a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and it reduces stress for students. You will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. I do not think this is a good idea. Most schools have three months of a break and people are used to having a three month long summer break, so there will be a lot of arguments into why change it now. Being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. To have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer.

Finally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. For example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. Having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation.

Another reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. Most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. A long summer break means more fun and less stress. For example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. Other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. Even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students.

Educators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. Being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. Schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. Most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. Having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things",0
"For example, it is possible that student performance could improve if they are given extra time to focus on studies or better understand the material. Furthermore, local school districts could be faced with strain due to the heightened burden of providing teachers, resources, and updating curriculum to accommodate the addition. 
The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours. In conclusion, the implications of adding extra time to the school day should be carefully considered before any additional hours are added.",1
"Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments.

However, teacher's opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they aren't robots who are just set up by the government. For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him.

Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he won't get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we won't have to turn in it late. We don't know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we don't have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. . This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources.

As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I don't agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they aren't really saving energy

Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesn't have, which make us a different environment than the business. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers.

My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybody's benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the school's main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesn't.

Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, let's use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class",0
"It is crucial that students take the time to invest in their education and understand the importance of good grades, and this policy encourages them to make the effort. It raises the educational standards for our school, while motivating and inspiring students to make the most of their education.. 
As a student, I believe that requiring students to maintain a grade C average to participate in extracurricular activities is a wise decision. This gracefully encourages students to strive to do their best in school, and understand the importance of working hard to achieve their goals. 

Overall, I believe this policy to require a grade C average is a beneficial change for the school activities. In my opinion, students should understand that there is a direct correlation between their academic performance and their ability to participate in activities outside of the classroom. 

Furthermore, this requirement allows the school to ensure that students can handle the extra workload associated with extracurricular activities, while still balancing their academic responsibilities. Ensuring this balance will lead to increased student success, as well as fewer overwhelmed and stressed students",1
"By taking a step back and focusing on the positive aspects of the task, I was eventually able to finish it. By maintaining a positive mindset, I was able to push through and cross the finish line.

In conclusion, I believe that a positive attitude is the key to success in life and is essential to meeting your goals. I have seen this principle in action many times. 
I strongly believe that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Soon enough, he landed a great job at a company he really wanted to work for.

Finally, when I was running my first marathon, I was determined to finish it but I was so exhausted by the middle of the race that I thought it was impossible. My success was a direct result of my changing attitude.

Another example is my friend who was unemployed for a long time. He became increasingly discouraged, but he eventually decided to change his attitude and stay positive. For example, when I was in university, I was struggling with a difficult assignment. At first, I had a negative attitude and was convinced I could not complete it. By believing in yourself and setting your sights high, you will be more likely to overcome any challenge and reach your desired outcome.. He made new contacts, revised his resume, and started to actively search for new opportunities",1
"When play basket ball make sure the court is large enough for the sport. Fitness is important for basket ball because it can bring up your stamina. The last thing for equipment is the out line of the court, it needs the out line for lineing up shots.

The skill of basket ball is important because of the gameplay is to win the game. Some people don't know how to play basket ball, Well I have some things that might help you with basket ball or build it or anything with the sport. People just need to practice and trained if they want to be good at something.. The last thing for the enviroment is the day time and nigth time, you should play in the day time because nigth time you can't see much but in day time you can pretty much see everthing.

Equipment is important for basket ball, so here some things you would need for basket ball. Strategy is important with teammates to win the game, think of new ways to beat the oppitsite team. The frist thing is the enviroment, most people play outside and others play inside, well I think you should play outside mostly on summer days because the enviroment is more cooler or warmer than other months. The next thing is a pole for the basket, make sure the pole is high enough for the basket and the ball to reach. Fourth thing is the good days to play basket ball, like summer days or sping time. The basket needs to be wide enough for the ball and a net that is short enough for the ball. The frist thing is a basket ball, make sure the ball is full of air and a frim grip. The thrid thing is make sure its not high winds outside to be cold, this will effect your gameplay for basket ball if its high winds. The court need to be a flat surface for the basket ball not to roll off. If you want to be good at the game then practice and trained your shots and make new openings. Then you have planing, planing ahead is good way of back up plans to prevent losing. Team work can make the game change from a losing game to a wining game, just by passing the ball to a teammate is important for skill. The second thing you should do is to try not to play in extreme temperature",0
"Working in the group is more beneficial rather than working alone to work in the group is fun, makes me be more responsible and it is also the easier and creative way of finding solutions for the problem.

First of all, working in the group is fun. This made my vision clear that working with others makes people more responsible.

Some say working with a group distracts them from the task, but I will disagree with them because I believe, that working in the group helps you find the creative way of solving the problems. Finally, students are not going to be stressed about the problem and will complete the task with higher quality.. When I was in the fifth grader I went to the camp over summer the first day they made us do a project with a group to earn the title of the best group. For example, I have a friend who didn't like to work with anyone or even talk in his classroom,,, one day his teacher put him with group of students after working with them he finally made a new friends and the work that teacher was giving them was much more enjoyable with mates. In my computer science class we usually work with groups so there is this guy that thinks he knows more than some of us and for that reason he didn't work with us, so we solved the problem the way that no one in our class has solved the problem this way and the teacher gave us extra points for being the creative group of the class, and the smart guy that I mentioned before couldn't solve that problem. This is way I don't like to underestimate my teammates or classmates I know that together we can be smarter, faster, and even

If the problem seems unsolvable together we can do it.

In conclusion, working with a group is enjoyable, make you fulfill your obligations, and makes it easy for students to solve any kind of tasks. I have friend his name is Generic_Name and I want to tell you something about him he is the most irresponsible student I have ever seen, but when it comes to a group work he is getting his job always done because he doesn't want his group lose the competition or simply fail the project. The benefits of working in the group or working alone. For that reason I think this is a great way of learning, communicating and building friendship with people around us.

Also group work makes us more responsible",0
"you can be able of leading them to work hard everyday and help them in motivating by not giving up easy on what they want to accomplish. I believe that choosing your own character is a way on finding who you really are because you can be able to show things that you never thought you were able of doing, you can set goals and try to put your best on accomplish them, and by setting your own character you can be able to help other people to follow the right path to success.

My first reason why is good of showing your own character is that you can show things that you never thought you were able to do. this can help you in so many things later in life because you can create or be able to experience new things that can be come very interesting in your life.

setting your own character can provide you on setting yourself goals too by believing in yourself and working hard everyday for what you want. Help other people whose doing things that they are not supposed to and leading them in the right path, and you can accomplish so many things by hard work.. Some people think that setting yourself goals is something that can't help you in life and you have to follow what others do to be able to find success. not being lazy it all and you would be able to have more energy in your system and try to work for something that can help you in the future and being proud of doing.

Last reason why setting your own character is a good thing because you can help a lot of people too by showing them the right path of success. They feel that people don't have enough potential to do things and by doing that they have to do what others do and not showing who they really are . One of John Lubbock famous quotes is, "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"". try to provide them certain thing what they can or cant do making them things a little hard but believing in their self and working harder then usual.

As you read, setting your own character is something that can bring you always to success, it motivates you and you can believe more in yourself on what you can do and getting out of your own conference zone. it can help you in so many ways because you can see your own potential and see who you really. you can be scared of certain things in life or wont be brave enough to try them but you have to be able to get out of your conference zone and try to step for yourself",0
"As students become more successful in school, their confidence will grow and they will be more willing to take on more difficult tasks and see them through to completion. A strong self-esteem is the cornerstone to success in school, and achieving success in school can help to reinforce a student's self-esteem further.. A strong and positive sense of self-worth can form the foundations for a student to reach for academic goals, believing in their ability to offer solutions and challenge intellectual tasks. 
Self-esteem and school success are intimately intertwined. But how can achieving success in school help promote a student's self-esteem? Although the journey of success can be long and winding, the feeling of accomplishment that comes from achieving goals can provide a sense of pride that is essential for a healthy self-esteem",1

One of my most remarkable talents I have developed over the years is my ability to write. Since I was a child, I have expressed my creativity through the written word. From reading classical works to understanding the importance of grammar, I have benefited greatly from their guidance.

As an immigrant, I am able to relate to the difficult journey of leaving one’s home in pursuit of a better life. Despite these unique differences, visitors can often find similar recreational activities that bring together old and new cultures alike. Overall, my experience living in Generic_City has been a positive one.. The experiences of being an immigrant can be both challenging and rewarding; I have encountered both opportunities and obstacles, but ultimately am grateful for the growth and progress. 
Generic_City is a rapidly changing destination that offers a variety of socioeconomic opportunities for immigrants from all walks of life. 

The culture and society in Generic_City differ from those of United States in several ways; language barriers, economic developments, and school systems are all examples of distinguishing characteristics. The city boasts a strong job market, competitive educational institutions, and a supportive government leadership.

"Whether it's a small gesture or a larger commitment, any act of kindness has the capacity to dramatically improve someone's life.. An act of kindness can provide hope and comfort to someone who might be in need. 

Moreover, an act of kindness can also act as a source of inspiration. It is possible that the kindness one person shows can have a far reaching effect and encourage people to improve the lives of those around them. A single action can cause a chain of reactions that spread outward, positively affecting the lives of multiple people. By showing someone that they are important and valued, it can have a profound effect on how that person values and views themself. If we look at the example of a coach who takes the time to mentor a younger person, that coach's act of kindness can not only have a positive effect on the life of the child, but also the child's family, community, and beyond. Whether it's a smile in passing, a word of encouragement, or a friendly gesture, any act of kindness has the potential to have a high impact on someone's life. 
In today's world, oftentimes the greatest gift we can give another person is a simple act of kindness. 

For starters, research has shown that an act of kindness has a ripple effect of its own. When one person performs an act of kindness, it has the potential to motivate others to act similarly. 

However, perhaps most importantly, an act of kindness can have a tremendous impact on someone’s self-esteem and mental health. 

Ultimately, acts of kindness can bring incredible positivity to both those who perform them and those who receive them",1
"It can open doors to new beginnings, help us stay resilient amidst hardships, and give us the energy to overcome any challenge. A positive attitude allows us to focus on our goals, look at every setback as an opportunity for growth, and be truly passionate about what we are striving for. 
One of the most important factors in becoming successful in life is to have a positive attitude. When we choose positively, we begin to see the world through a lens of endless possibilities—one that can help us to experience true fulfillment within our lives.. This makes us more motivated, creative, and confident, which in turn gives us the necessary tools to reach our desired destination.

On the other hand, having a negative attitude puts us in an energy-draining downward spiral where we focus on failures and obstacles rather than proactive solutions. 

A great example of how positivity impacts our success is that of setting goals. Having an optimistic perspective allows us to discover opportunities we may have otherwise overlooked and provides us with the courage to take risks and push through difficult times. This can not only limit us from accomplishing our goals but also lead us to lose sight of our hopes, dreams, and aspirations.

Therefore, having a positive attitude is essential to achieving happiness, respect, and success in life. We may also find that a positive outlook brings more happiness and respect, not just from those around us, but also from ourselves",1

It is important to be mindful of both the benefits and potential shortcomings of each approach, so that your decision-making process can be tailored to meet the needs of your particular situation.. 
Making your own life decisions can be both highly rewarding and filled with challenges. However, this can also create a sense of passivity or dependence upon others, as the bulk of the decisions are made by those others rather than by yourself.

Ultimately, making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts and authorities can each offer advantages depending on your needs and preferences. On the other hand, it can also be incredibly stressful, as the sole responsibility for the outcome of your decisions lies squarely on your shoulders.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can also offer its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Expert advice may provide a level of security and confidence within your decisions, knowing that their experience and knowledge can help guide you properly",1
"People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult and sometimes I need help doing my homework and it would help me have in my school a after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students.. I'm not against having the after school homework club. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me. I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and i would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school or they don't remember they have homework",0
"Taking a break and having fun also give families the chance to strengthen relationships, increasing trust, communication, and understanding. While some families may enjoy the structure that a yearly school schedule provides, the benefits of having longer school holidays and more frequent breaks can’t be overlooked. 

The benefits of having longer holidays, a year-round school schedule, and frequent breaks are clear. Taking vacations and engaging in activities with family offers life-long benefits, providing an opportunity for relaxation, growth, and creating lasting memories.. 
    
When it comes to taking a break from the everyday grind of work and studies, having longer holidays, a year-round school schedule, and more frequent breaks from school offer countless benefits. From going to the pool or amusement park to having family movie night or picnicking in the park, each activity presents a unique opportunity for families to spend quality time with each other. People estimate that taking a vacation can reduce the chance of a heart attack by a whopping 50 percent, while also cutting down on stress and reducing the risk of depression. 

For families, the options for vacation and activities are endless. Taking a breather from work and studies provides an opportunity to relax and reset, relieving stress and allowing one to be more productive",1
"For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it. Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens.     . when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase",0
"However, it could be difficult to accommodate certain classes that require in-person student participation, such as science experiments or exercises within a physical classroom setting.

On the other hand, for school staff, a four-day school week with ten hours per day could mean working more hours within those days. For students, it would give them more free time in their week to pursue hobbies or focus on individual research projects. 
A four-day school week with each day lasting ten hours may seem to be an appealing option, as it has potential advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and school staff. It has potential advantages and disadvantages for students and teachers, as well as considerations for the school staff and resources available.. It could also allow teachers more flexibility to plan ahead and their teaching approach, as well as the ability to cover more material in a certain amount of time. Whether this is an attainable option depends on the resources the school has available to provide these services and support staff. Depending on the school's other services, such as extracurricular activities and on-site care, this could mean added demands that would be outside of traditional school hours. 

In conclusion, a four-day school week with ten hours per day could be a feasible option for your school depending on a variety of factors",1
"So i asked her how to made that egg, and of course i had broken a lot of eggs. But me, i thought a different way. I think i'm going to agree what Churchill had said. For an example, in my country, Vietnam, people always say that failure is the key lead to your success. So i continued learning how to cook the egg, and now i succeed with the fried egg dish. I remembered when i was 8, i was really love the egg that my mom made for me. In my conclusion, i want to say that being a failure isn't a bad thing, because it helps me know that i can do better.. And i also wanted to give up, but, i'm really love the foods that made from egg. I thought that if i fail,i 'll have more experience. Some people think they are smart and they'd never fail. I have failed many times in my life, but i never give up. Because, if i success so easily, i won't able to understand how hard to earn something",0
". The British john Lubbock wrote 'your character will be what you yourself choose to make it'

there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they dont fell good about them selves and have a lot of thinking inside of them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i dont think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control.

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives.

Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.

There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in.

There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

Have a nice day, that is what makes us movie froward every time that we get stuck",0
"I had the pleasure of speaking to locals in their native language, something they deeply appreciated. It can be challenging to learn the language, but it's worth the effort.. Not only can it help you when travelling in a new country, it can also help to foster meaningful connections and help enlarge business opportunities. By breaking it down into segments, we were able to cover a lot of ground and eventually had a basic conversation in Vietnamese.

One major benefit of speaking Vietnamese came into play during my visit to Beihai. Not only did I gain knowledge about their culture and customs, but I was also able to connect said locals with potential customers, broadening my business horizons.

In summary, speaking Vietnamese has numerous benefits and can be truly rewarding. 
My friend and I decided to take on the challenge of learning one of the top 10 hardest languages to learn - Vietnamese. Not only would it make it much easier to communicate with the locals, but it would also help to build bridges and make meaningful connections with people around the world.

When it came to getting started, I took the lead and taught my friend the basics of the language, from pronunciation to conjugations. From our research, we discovered that there are numerous benefits of being able to speak this language, especially for travelers",1
"We as people have to set goal's for the future and plan ahead to accomplish them. I'll say is, with everything going on in the world we got to get together and help each other more and come together as a team NO! more as a family, when one of us fall down we lift each other up, if one of us get's hurt we heal each other. There's got to be thing's we can do, hard time's dont last forever at these moment's we got to remember how far we come from hard time's when things didnt look good for us. One thing i learn while being incarcerated you got to value yourself more than you value other's, if you dont value yourself what's the point for setting up goal's if all they going to do is collect dust.

Everybody haves different opinion's some people might think the world is at fault for the choice's they make and thats not true, people blame others when they know their in the wrong or done something wrong than try to say it's the other person's fault. The world can try to charge you, it can try to break you, it can throw you to the side but the goal's you set up and the people by your side will help you complete the dream's and goal's you wish about.. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson, have's kind of a point about the world trying to make you something else.

My point of view is that we all have choice's we make to better our selves to make us better people in the world but some of the choice's we make as human's can lead us to a wrong path",0
"The greats benefits to work with a group

To work on groups is better for many reasons,everybody can help each others,in groups student's can do a better work,and it can help all the people on the group to learn more skills,it can help students to know each others and be friends, more communications, more ideas and sometimes it can be helpful to work in groups because some students don't know what to do,i thing teachers should let student's to work more on groups so like that they would help each other and work better,and is good to work with a group because that can help you for the rest of your life like on your job also with your family and you con do better and a great job if you work in group

It can be helpful for students to work in group,First, because with more people helping are more and betters ideas and more helpful for every students,and sometimes student's don't know what to do,but if somebody on the group help so he would understand and know how to do a great job and work with a group is much helpful than work alone on many ways like to understand better with communication with your group and it can be helpful so you can do a good work and pass the class and not failed,and work in group it can help you to know others people that are in the same classroom but you never have the oportunity to talk wich their so in the teacher make a group and you can joing to one there is going to be new people and you can know others people

,Second,it is good for student's to work in groups because they can learn more skills such like the communication and they can help each others with the written,and also they can help each others how the way they talk. The communication is important and many cases because with communication you can do many things, like if you don't understand something you can tell somebody for help and all the persons on the groups can practice all days to do a great work,and also some student's need a lot of help so students that know more can join to the groups to help the others,but sometimes is not because some students don't know how to do the work sometimes it because they don't understand sometimes is because the language is a problems for some student's so there is good to make groups to help them,Third it can be an experience to work in groups because some students that don't know each others later on they can be friends and work in groups it can be helpful to students,but also to school because work on groups students can understand more and they can get betters grades also work in groups and a a good relationship it can be helpful not only at the school it can be helpful like in your home with the family and not to get in trouble with their, but also it can help you on your job to work well and not to have problems with the people that you work with,is like on soccer that why it call a soccer team because they help each others they share new or more strategies that it can help others to do a great job because work in groups students have more and betters benefits to do a great job,Finally is good to have a good communication in groups because with a great communication all the the group can understand each others and is important to have a good relationship in the group so like that they can do a better job and some students help others and that is great to be generous with others because if you help to someone that need help other people is going to help you on what you need and is a lot much better to work in group than alone sometimes when you are working alone and you got stuck in something no body is going to help you,but if you are working with more people in group they going to help you on what you need but most of the teachers want's to students work alone sometimes is good that students work alone because sometimes students got distracted for the people on the group and the teachers don't wants students to copy each others sometimes is good to work alone maybe better concentration,but sometimes is not that good to work alone because sometimes you got stuck in somethig, but if you are working with a group they are going to help you i would like to see more teachers that put more student's to work in group i don't think student's would like to work alone than with a group is better an sometimes is more easy and faster

In conclusion, is a great idea for me thats teachers make students to work in groups on my opinion is much helpful to they work in groups instead to work alone,because when people work in groups they have betters ideas and they can do a better work with more interesting and more opinions is better to do a great job and also have a great relationship and a great communication is so important to work in a group and some students know more than others so the students thats know more is good that they help the others on what they need and is good to work in group so like that you can know others people i hope teachers continuing making groups to students can learn more than what they know and work in group it can help you on your life because if you got a job and many people work there too but you don't like to work with others people as a group the boss is going to kick you out only because you don't know how to work as a group and if you only like to work alone it can be a problem if you don't understand work with others people is better always more ideas,opinions like that you can do a better work and it can help your future job and the rest of your life sometimes some student's don't like to work in group's sometimes it because they don't know others people,but i thing if teachers would like to student's work more in groups i thing they would like it and they can have more communication student's would like to work with a group, I like to work with a group because sometimes i don't know what to do so others students help me to do a great work and we all share other.",0
"In doing so, we give them the opportunity to experience a moment of joy and relief.

We are all connected, and kindness has an infinite ripple effect. Whether it’s a gesture of tenderness, compassion, or simply a listening ear, kindness is a healing balm to the soul. The dawn of a new day, a cool breeze on a summer evening, or the beauty of a sunset can all be enjoyed by reaching out and extending a kind gesture to someone who might be struggling. However, something that we should never forget is the value of a single act of kindness. As such, no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. In the face of difficulty, an act of kindness, no matter how small, can provide some light in the darkness. Kindness isn’t meant to be measured—it’s meant to be shared. Kindness can help us to appreciate the little moments that make life special. Even in the toughest of times, small acts of kindness like a smile, lending a hand to a friend in need, or simply being a good listener can be enough to hold onto hope and stay positive. It has the power to lift us up, keep us positive, and most importantly, seize the day no matter the circumstances.. 

When faced with adversity, it can be easy to forget that even the smallest acts of kindness are enough to make a difference. 
It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the trials and tribulations that life throws our way",1
"I li9ke to paint landscapes because I

feel relax and am not thinking nothing I forget about everything and I reflect how I feel doing landscapes

I also like to paint landscapes because I love acrilic paints and how they mix and how they work.. I chose to do landscapes because I like to paint

I like to see the color and how they are mixted that's so cool. The type of work I would like to have is a stalyst professional and paint landscapes.

Stalyst professional is a really good job you get a lot of money only doing hairstyles.

Painting landscapes is a really good job too because you are doing what you want doing a really good art and a lot of people like how it looks like they pay a lot of money for the landscapes if you do a really good job.

I chose stalyst professional because is interesting to do, you learn a lot about girls hairstyles and boys hairstyles I think is a really good job because a lot of people likes to do hairstyles and people likes to do haicuts because there is a lot of different things for example new hair color or a new hairstylt and stalyst is a really good job because you get a lot of money and you can do whatever you want with your own money but working hard.

I think the workplace will be in a place that there is a lot of people, because when is people they are interesting to have new haistyles for example if someone goes to have a new hairstyle and is really cool people are going to wish have the same hairstyle or a different hairstyle.

People are going to be really happy to have a new hairstyle because some people are bored to have the same haircut and if is a place with a lot of people they are going to love that place.

I chose doing landscapes because is interesting for a lot of people, because if you do a really good lanscapes people are going to love it and they are going to be interest to have one.

I think the workplace for landscapes is like where is a lor of people that like to see landscapes and buy them because landscapes are so pretty",0

"My grandmother, for example, kept going in her job well past retirement age because she was passionate about her work and enjoyed being surrounded by a positive and supportive community.

Though there are certain challenges that life throws our way, with the right frame of mind and the right support system, we can conquer almost anything. It is all too easy to become discouraged or overwhelmed in the face of setbacks and opposition. Make it a point to savor accomplishments and embrace the journey of learning and growth, even if it's during a difficult period. Change our internal dialogue from ""This is too hard"" to ""I can do this.""

Family and friends are also significant resources for staying motivated. To sustain enthusiasm and resilience throughout our lives in order to achieve our goals, it is important to develop our own personal strategies for dealing with depression and disappointment.

One strategy is to focus on the positives in any situation. Having an accountability partner, even just checking in every once in a while, can remind us of our goals and inspire us to make progress. We can also draw strength and motivation from the people around us. As long as we remember to stay optimistic, stay motivated, and always remember why we are striving, we will be able to achieve our goals.. 
Life is filled with moments of joy, as well as times of struggle. Another key approach is to foster a positive and resilient mindset",1
"Dear principal ,As a student i think we should balance The school menu of healththeir school lunches is a good idea and also a bad idea, the resaon why is when most students don't take care of their own body by eating junk food but most student like their favorite food for example, most students in my class when they eat their favorite food for example pizza, in lunch it will affect their stomach but not only their stomach but they have nothing health besides milk to eat.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              . So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods.

When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body",0
"You will fail and fall but its very important that you get up and keep fighting because once failure takes over, it will be hard to get back up.                . However, having encouragement won't mean anything because if you're encourage enough, you will get back up and do anything you can to be successful.

At last, learning from your mistakes is the key to be successful. To to successful you may have to archive it. Every each person in this world know that they're capable of, and every each person know what their weakness are. In life, you will fail a lot of time but it's important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes.

To begin with, a lot of people thinks failure will only make you look bad and some thinks its the end of the world for them but that's not the case. That's why Winston Churchill once said ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. So will you just give up if you failed? and of course, people will judge you because you're not perfect. You might encounter or even fail so many times, but who cares, as long you try and try you will be successful. Some people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement. Also you will need to earn the key to success, but once you find it, you will achieve anything in life not because you didn't give up but because your learn from your failure and mistake.

In conclusion, people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement and in life, you will fail a lot of time but it's important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes. Every each person make mistakes and having a motivation in your self will get your somewhere: however, when a person is lack of motivation in their life, they won't be as much successful and failure will take over.

Secondly, when it comes to hard times, a lot of people say that there's no point of trying if you're meant to be a failure",0
"Another example is that students would not communicate with other students and would not know the importance of Team Work. Most of the times, the students don't get the help they need by the school. Also, some students get bullied by other students and there is no one who could defend them. This idea emerged because there is many conflicts that school has to deal with, for example discrimination, and violence and between the students. Anyways, the school helps us to get right path for our lives, so without it, we would not the education we need to improve in our lives and in the world. If the school applies more fair rules, the students would feel more safety and gain a lot of confidence. So, thanks to the advances of technology, the school can provide their services at home. Also, they would not have an experience by doing activities (such as playing sports, instruments, going to filmstrips, etc,)

which help them to develop useful skills. Another reason are that it is less stressful because the students would more time to complete any work. Also, the school has to have better teachers who really want to help their students and not teachers that only care about their job. Is a great method, but not as going to the school, sit in your chair and learn. The reason for this is because some teachers don't really care about whether the students are learning or not, but about their money. This happens in a many schools, such as schools in Mexico, United States, Central America, etc. For example construction, cosmetics, arts, music, engineering, technology, etc.

In conclusion, attending classes online is a great method, but not as much as going to the school. For example there will be no jobs for teachers who really want to teach, share experiences to their students, and help them to improve in their lives. Also, it helps the students to better subject. Also parents can supervise their children and help them if they need, and they would not have to worry about attendances.

Classes online are a great benefit for students but they their disadvantages as well. For example, the rate for shooting will be reduced, and the students will not suffer any discrimination against other students. Another disadvantage is that schools would not have alternate classes that helps them to chose the career they want to. The school is always going to be a learning center. This method has its advantages, but also its disadvantages.

One of the advantages attending classes online is that is more comfortable and secure for the students. So, in my opinion, attending classes at home is a great option for the students.

Classes online, well known as ""homeschooling"", is a method in which students can do the assignment of their classes at home in their computer. For example, students can watch videos about any specific subject, observe the procedures, and replay them if they are confused.        ",0
"Although working alone can be more efficient and organized, it is important to consider how it can hinder creativity and cultural appreciation.. For example, if one person is harder to work with or slower to respond during the task, it can be difficult to stay on track. There is no need to worry about individual personalities and conflict. Group work can have the benefits of increased cultural appreciation and stronger communication. 
Excerpt:

Working in groups and working alone both offer unique benefits and challenges. 

Overall, working in groups may provide more benefits such as heightened cultural appreciation, communication, and collaboration, but it can also lead to challenges in managing individual personalities and delegating tasks. On the other hand, working alone can help an individual stay organized and productive. In a group, diversity of thought and differing perspectives can be appreciated. However, when working alone it can be easier to get sidetracked and lack inspiration or creativity. This encourages people to be more open-minded so they can work together and create a higher quality product. Working alone also eliminates the need to divide the tasks and there is usually greater responsibility. However, group work can also be challenging in terms of managing individual personalities and completing tasks within a specific timeline. Each has advantages and shortcomings",1

"3 reasons I think that students should start this club is so that they'll have an easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them, they can work together to get their homework done, and students can work with their teachers to raise their grades up in a specific subject.

My first reason is that students can have a easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them. My 3 reasons that students should work with their teachers to raise their grade up in a specific subject is so that they can be more productive in class, they can catch up on what they've missed in class, and the teacher can guide the students on what they're confused on on their homework.

Overall, these are my reasons why I think that students should have the opportunity to have an after school homework club.. I think that students should start an after school homework club. My 3 reasons that students should work together to get their homework done is so that they can turn it into their teacher once they're done, they'll have it all completed when their teacher asks the students to give their homework up, and they'll receive a good grade from their teacher.

My third reason is that students can work with their teacher to raise their grades up in a specific subject. My 3 reasons that students can have a easier time doing their assignments is that the students can ask their teachers for assistance if they need it, they'll get their work done quicker, and when their teachers come to collect their work, the students will have it already completed.

My second reason is that the students can work together to get their homework done",0

Overreacting is another promble kids have. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much",0
"Take learning distance on home is not good ideas .  . But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. sometime when we don't undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times. first reason is not the same to take on school. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping.

In conclusion. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant.

To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes",0

The counselor told John that taking physics, calculus, computer programming, and engineering classes would be very helpful for him in his future endeavors. With this information, John felt more informed and prepared to make the best educational decisions for himself.. To get some guidance, he decided to talk to one of his school's guidance counselors. 
John had done lots of research into what career he wanted to pursue after high school, and felt confident that he wanted to become an engineer. He also mentioned that the courses would give John opportunity to develop new abilities such as problem solving and critical thinking, as well as enable him to acquire industry-standard knowledge and advance his technical skills. However, he wasn't sure which classes at his high school would be best for him to take in order to help him prepare for his career",1

Thomas Jefferson believed that productivity was essential for personal growth and development. Idle activities, such as watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing video games, can​ be enjoyable, but can also reduce our motivation and prevent us from reaching our goals. 

To accomplish more, we must set achievable goals and use our time wisely. To achieve our goals, we must utilize strategies such as breaking them up into manageable parts, setting a timeline for completion, and utilizing motivational techniques. 

When seeking to maximize our productivity, it is important to differentiate between Idle activities and productive activities. . Jarvis, ""Determine never to be idle…It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson recognized the potential power of consistent effort and encouraged others to stay busy in order to achieve worthwhile goals. Productive activities, such as research, problem-solving, reading, and project-building, can help us to pursue our ambitions and are important for personal growth. Making a conscious effort to focus our efforts on productive activities rather than idle ones may also help us to be more successful in reaching our goals. 

At the same time, Jefferson believed that inactivity could have an important role to play in how we use our time. In his view, moments of pause could lead to reflection, contemplation, and self-examination–all of which are critical mental exercises that can lead to increased productivity, once motivation has been restored. He wrote in a letter to William C",1

On the other hand, technology has created a divide between people and their relationships. 
The impact of technology on people's lives is complicated. 

Technology has undeniably changed the way people live today and how they might be living without it. . Technology has become a replacement for physical contact and has made it harder for people to meet and form strong relationships with each other, leading to social isolation. Moreover, parents often worry about their children spending too much time on their devices and not engaging with the world around them. Although it can be beneficial to certain aspects of life, it is important to be aware of the negative consequences of technological dependence. On one hand, technology has allowed people to connect with others in ways never before possible, allowing us to stay in touch with close friends or family members, even if they are far away. Additionally, buying items online has connected people to lucrative deals they otherwise wouldn't have access to and allowed them to make efficient, timely purchases",1
"Banning cell phones completely might be too extreme if the main concern is misuse, as confiscating them away from students would not hold oneself accountable to foster responsible behaviors. These solutions are a way to create a balance between the potential misuse of cell phones in school, and their potential benefits as learning tools. 

The debate on allowing cell phones in school should consider the respective pros and cons, as well as the potential solutions to effectively manage the devices' use in an educational setting. 
Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, with an ever-increasing penetration in our schools. An alternate approach could be to allow the use of cell phones under teacher supervision, emphasizing the importance of appropriate usage in the classroom as a digital literacy skill and through the use of classroom policies. On one hand, cell phones offer conveniences such as access to online resources, and can be used for educational tools such as apps, as well as an outlet for reporting instances of bullying or abuse. By studying how to effectively manage the use of cell phones in an educational setting, and by implementing appropriate policies, we can ensure a safe and responsible learning environment for our students.. 

Overall, we cannot deny the advantages of cell phone use in school, but we should also recognize the potential risks if left unmanaged. 

The prevalence of cell phones in school also gives rise to the use of alternative solutions, such as filtering applications and messaging services that limit distractions and inappropriate media access. On the other hand, the use of cell phones in school can be distracting to students, and their misuse can result in cheating on exams and cyberbullying. It is also important to consider making resources available for students to learn proper internet safety, and for teachers to understand and accommodate the devices' use in the classroom",1
"They also have access to a virtually unlimited range of resources that wouldn't necessarily be available to them in a traditional classroom setting.

Additionally, distance learning is widely accessible, removing all physical barriers to education. Whether it's due to geographical distance or other circumstances, distance learning can provide students with options they wouldn't have in traditional settings. 
Distance learning has become increasingly more popular in recent years, as technology has allowed us to create innovative learning experiences that can be accessed from almost anywhere in the world. Students have the option to access course material 24/7, allowing them to work around their own personal schedules. By comparison, traditional in-class learning is done within a confined physical environment, limiting both student accessibility and teaching capabilities. For example, students who have disabilities or chronic illnesses can benefit from distance learning, as they can interact with the same educational content from the comfort of their own home.

Overall, it is clear that distance learning can provide a range of benefits over traditional in-class learning. This means they can listen to lectures, submit assignments, and take exams in their own free time. Therefore, distance learning can provide a number of advantages that make it a more preferable option for learners.

For instance, distance learning can generally be more flexible than traditional learning. By allowing students to access courses anywhere with an internet connection and receive the same educational content, distance learning has proven to be a more preferable option for those seeking an alternative to traditional learning.",1

"Taking the time to dress appropriately, come early, be polite and friendly, and practice good communication are all great ways to do just that. Whether you're meeting someone for the first time in a professional setting, a social gathering, or in any other kind of situation, having a positive first impression is essential for building relationships and trust. Doing so will show that you're willing to engage in meaningful dialogue, listen, and understand what the other person is saying.

Overall, making a good first impression is key to any successful interaction. Additionally, make sure to show up early and be prepared. 

Fortunately, there are some simple things that you can do to make a good first impression. Additionally, make sure to have an honest and open attitude; no one likes when people put up walls or act unreasonably. Making small talk can be a great way to show that you’re interested in the other person. Your first impression is a crucial part of any interaction, and it can sometimes be the difference between success and failure. 

Finally, make sure to practice good communication etiquette. One of the most important is to dress appropriately for the occasion. Be sure to introduce yourself properly, listen to the other person’s thoughts, and take the time to express yourself clearly and respectfully. 
First impressions are essential in today's world. The way you dress can speak volumes, and dressing in a way that's both professional and appropriate is a great way to make a good impression.

"Group work helps foster a sense of collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. They can learn valuable leadership skills, as well as the importance of listening and understanding others' points of view. 
Working in a group is beneficial for students and life outside of school. 

Overall, group work is beneficial for students in several aspects. These skills are invaluable both in and out of the classroom and can help prepare students for entering the workforce. 

For example, working in a group can teach students the importance of compromise, negotiation and organization when tackling a problem. Working in a group also encourages students to form meaningful relationships with their peers, which can help ease the transition from school to a professional environment, where team collaboration is vital. By participating in group work, students gain the important skills needed to succeed both in and out of the classroom.",1
"For example, if you are a athlete and you are constantly over working yourself there is a high chance you may get injured, but if you balance yourself and take breaks you are allowing your muscles to heal themselves which also boosts your performance for the next practice or game. For example, if a man wants to sell a product, and he puts hours upon hours into this item but there is no quality then the item will not sell. Allowing yourself to take breaks also improves the quality of the work you provide whether its paperwork or sports.

Although some people think never being idle is a good thing because you can achieve more work with no set backs. There are many instances where people have the mindset that you must be doing something constantly in order to achieve the most. Having a creative mindset will allow you to think freely, and come up with brilliant, unique ideas that give you an advantage over possible competition. I believe that having this mindset is terrible and is not beneficial to the person. These problems can be avoided by taking breaks, taking breaks allows your mind to relax and release stress that has been piled over a certain amount of time. When an individual is working the factor that they must think about most is the quality of the work they are providing. Another example we can use for this scenario is when an entrepreneur is constantly trying to start a business without taking a step back and allowing themselves to come up with a unique idea that they have passion for. Finally, if you are one of the individuals who like to work diligently without breaks, you should at least consider taking a break once because it will not hurt you, and if anything it will help you.. Where as if someone who does take breaks is working in the same field as another individual they are working less, but achieving more because their ideas are more unique and thought through.

When you are constantly working there is a high chance that your work may lose its quality. For example, if you are constantly writing all the time you are not giving yourself time to create unique ideas that separate you from the rest of the competition. I still think that being idle serves a purpose because you want to be able to incorporate quality into your work, you also want to be creative when it comes to providing, and lastly you want to be able to gain the benefits from relaxing your body and your mind. I believe this because if you take the time to rest you will find that it allows you to regain a creative mindset, it allows your work to regain its quality, and taking time to rest serves many health benefits.

Regaining a positive, creative mindset serves many purposes. When working diligently all the time there may be times where you may be very stressed out or you've tired your body out, but these problems can be avoided. If the quality of the work is not there then it completely takes away from the rest of the qualities from that body of work. Where as if the man takes constant breaks focusing on quality, and not quantity then the item will have a lot more attraction from people.

Being idle sometimes rather then working persistently also has its benefits",0

After analyzing the pros and cons of keeping the current school lunch menu versus changing to a healthier one, it is clear that there would be several advantages of making the change. 

Based on this analysis, I recommend that the school adopts the new, healthier lunch menu to improve student health and wellbeing, save costs, and reduce the strain on other resources.. Additionally, making healthier food choices has the potential to reduce the burden on other resources such as the environment. This would save time and money that would have otherwise been spent on visits to the doctor or absenteeism from school. With healthier options, students would have more nutritious meals, leading to improved health and better overall performance",1

Having a positive attitude in life plays an important role in one's personal and professional success. Success is the result of the combination of all of these elements.. 

At the same time, many argue that there is no single key to success and it is more important to focus on skills and hard work than attitude or outlook. It can help in certain ways - like fostering a healthy self-esteem and helping build healthy and supportive relationships - but it cannot entirely replace hard work and preparation. There are countless unreliable biographies, for example, of famous people claiming to have an unattainable positive outlook that was responsible for their success.

Ultimately, having a positive attitude is important for success in life, but it is not the only factor. Studies have found that positive attitudes can increase self-esteem, create more meaningful relationships, lead to better health and help build resilience in the face of life's struggles. There are many examples of successful people who have demonstrated the power of a positive attitude to shape their lives. For instance, Steve Jobs was famously known to have a strong optimistic outlook, which is often argued to be one of the key contributors to his success",1
"I think this quote has a lot of different meanings and I think it depends on your own personal experiences and It has honestly helped me a lot through my teenage year and overall my biggest accomplishment was to follow my heart and be who I really want to be in life just like the Ralph Waldo Emerson said. This reminds me of myself because in my senior year of High School I didn't have enough credits in order to graduate that really got my family disappoint that the time I was going to an online school and it was harder for me to make up for all the classes but I saw how my own family started to put me down and it did hurt my feelings but that used that feeling to pick myself up and work everyday on the classes to be able to graduate on time. People should not listen to what other's say it only matters what you know that you can accomplish and that you believe in yourself that is all it takes to became and be where you want to be. I speak two languages Spanish and English and I believe because I speak two languages fluently I have something to give to the world, to the community and to any one in need. This quote has reminded that you should truly believe in yourself, be yourself, do hard work and it will motivate you to be where you want to be. . This showed people and most importantly it showed me that im capable of showing people who I really am by doing hardwork.

I think everyone has a lot to offer to this world, you never know who will be the next person to discover a cure for a illness that people thought it was terminal. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a quote that has Inspired me,""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". Everyone is capable of doing what there heart desires it just take determination, hard work and desire to accomplish what you want. People may or may not agree with what want you want to do, their are always going to be someone who is going to try to bring you down emotionaly, physically or mentally but you have to show them that you are going to be yourself and do what whatever it needs to take to accomplish it. I truly agree with this quote because it demonstrates who you really are by doing hard work,everyone has something to give to the world and it is important for self esteem.

By doing a lot of hard work and not giving up, it demonstrates to people who you really are, that you are a person who is determined to get where they want to be and who preservers no matter what the chanlleges are. I finally felt like I was doing something for myself because my parents wanted to keep me at home but I managed to get through everything and anything while living on my own and It made me more independent person and it helped me boost my energy and believe in myself.

Nevertheless, Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". You can not always depend on people to get you what you need, to get you where you want to be. I know my own family wanted me to be a lawyer to help people with immigration lawsuits and for a while I started to consider following my parents dream of me being a lawyer to make them happy but my passion for the medical field was bigger and from my knowledge a big percent of pregnant women are Hispanic and as a person who speaks Spanish very well,I think I could help out people who don't know English in order to get the resources they need.

Being yourself and showing the world what you are capable of shows the world that you believe in yourself and it is important for your self esteem too because it makes you feel good about yourself and most of time your going to be alone doing your own stuff, taking care of your business. My plans after High School is to go to college to become a ultrasound technician. I remember when I moved out of my parents house with my son and having my own room, my own space and paying bills made me feel so good about myself",0
"Additionally, online schools can offer access to a wider range of courses and subject areas, providing more specific focus for students and enabling parents to tailor their child's syllabus. Without having to attend physical classes, busy working adults can pursue their studies at their own pace, allowing them to take time to explore new topics and learn at a rate which suits them. Despite the potential drawbacks, online schooling can offer more flexible schedules, greater access to course material, and improved access to education for adults.. 
Attending classes online has become an increasingly popular option for students who are looking for an alternative to traditional schooling. 

In addition to offering a more flexible approach, online schools may also provide opportunities for individuals wishing to return to education later in life. 

Overall, online schools can provide a valuable alternative to traditional institutions. 

When weighing up the pros and cons of attending an online school, it is important to consider the costs associated with these types of educational programs. Many students find that they can benefit from the increased flexibility that online schools provide, allowing them to fit their educational pursuits into their work and family life. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors can make it difficult to ask questions and get feedback in time-sensitive situations. Although costs may be reduced in comparison with traditional settings, many online schools still require students to purchase textbooks or other learning materials which could increase the overall financial burden",1
"First impression is like the first step toward your goals, so if you have a negative impression it will be almost impossible for you to get there, because having this impression can also effect your lessons, but if you have a positive impression it will be much easier to get there, because you can have more success in your lessons. Everything that you have control of them, and you want to change them, you can do so. If a thing come to your life, and you know that, it will have a negative impression on your life try to keep them away, because they can make problems for, they can pretend you from having a good future, they will try to destroy you, so you are the only person who can keep all these things away. For most of the peoples it will be hard to forgot about their first impression, because they have a good knowledge with that, and they think it is good even if it is a negative impression. As the boy grows up, and recognize that he should change the negative impression that he had at first, which kept him away from his friends or classmates. It can bring a lot of changes on you it can change you future, your position in a place.

I think that those who want to change their first impression should know that, this will not be easy, but if they try, and keep this in mind, that if they bring this change in their life they actually achieve a very big success. Changing this show them that everything that they want to change in their life is up to them, however, it will not be easy to do that, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible. For example; if a boy in a place or society have a negative impression, other people who live in there will not let their children s to play with him, or to go to school together, or even their parents will try to change their children s classes if they know that they are in the same class, because they don't want their children to be like him, or to have a negative impression that he has. When we try to find new friends we always try to find about their impressions in our life; how can they help us to solve our problems, or how can they help us to achieve our goals. . They will know that having a positive impression is not in everyone's luck, those who have a positive impression, on their society, school or etc will have a successful future. Changing the first impression is not impossible for those who have a strong trust on theirselves, and really want to change this, especially, if this impression is negative, because he knows or soon he will know that this can be very bad for him, and can keep him down in school, society, or in the place they live. Those who have negative impression can't reach their success, because having a negative impression is like a wall between you, and your success, that will prevent from you achieving your success. He will try to change it to positive impression, which will be hard and for him it will be a strange thing, because he never tried this before, but, as he continues he will realize that, how much he was bad with that negative impression, and how much he was hurt, by that negative impression. In the process of changing this impression they will also learn a lot of new about how much will a positive impression good for them what can a positive impression do for them. It is not going to be easy, but that doesn't mean that it will be impossible. It well be hard, but not impossible. As, he knows that how much a negative impression will hurt them, they will try to change it. For most of the people changing their first impression looking impossible, because they are never going to try it, they never want to experience a new thing, or maybe most of them think that this is not that important, but, I think that first impression is also very important in life. They become to change themselves from what they were before, tried to forgot about the negative impressions they had before.

if you Have a negative impression at first, and you want to change it, it will be hard, but it is not impossible, if you really want to change it. Having a negative impression at first, and changing it will take much time, but changing this will help you to reach where you want, it will help you to achieve your goals, and it will help you to find a good friends, everyone will try to be your friend, and wants to have a good relationship with you, so you not only help yourself, but you will also help your friends to reach their success or to achieve their goals. First impression can also have a large effect in someone's life, if it is a positive impression it can lead to the success, they want to have, but having a negative impression will not only take away your success, but it will also keep you down in your society, you will not have the respect, that you want have in your society. I'm disagree with this statement, that the first impression is impossible to change, because, I have seen a lot of people who doesn't had a positive impression at first, but later they completely changed. Most of the peoples want to change their first impression, because they haven't seen any positive result from it; they want to change it for a good future. Everything in your life is in your control, and you are the only person that can change what ever you want to change in your life, it just depends on you, that you are going to handle the situation. Having friends with positive impression in life will help you to take over your problems easily, but if you have friends with negative impressions, they can put their own negative impressions on you too, they will make think like a loser, because they don't want to reach your success.

In my idea those who want to change their first impression, first they have to think why they want to change it, what negative result they have seen with this impression, after they reached the position to change their first impression, they should start working for. This kind of people will have a hard time to forgot their first impression",0

Although it is tempting to think that sometimes it is better to do nothing, doing nothing rarely brings substantial benefits. Time wasted and goals not achieved can lead one to feel unmotivated and incomplete. To this day, it remains a timeless piece of advice for those looking to make the most of their life. By stepping out of one's comfort zone, new paths open allowing one to become the best version of themselves. If one chooses to be idle, the effects can be detrimental. It is more rewarding and beneficial in the long run to be proactive and take initiative towards what you truly desire. 
One of the most influential quotes of all time, Thomas Jefferson said ""Determine never to be idle"". Therefore, I agree with Thomas Jefferson's sentiment and believe that it is crucial to be determined and never idle.. Allocating time wisely and making responsible decisions can open up doors to opportunities that may have otherwise been missed. By being active and responsible, people can make progress towards the goals they set out to accomplish",1

"Instead of feeling overwhelmed with the project, I could focus on understanding the concepts I was presented with, and use that knowledge to come up with my own creative solutions or ideas. A study published in the International Journal of Research and Reviews in Applied Sciences showed that when students were given guidance, structure and support, their overall learning experience improved. Instead of having to think of an idea from scratch, I had a framework to work off of – the challenge was figuring out ways to take that project and make it my own. In my experience, having a teacher-designed project gave me a starting point to expanding my knowledge and learning. 
When it comes to classrooms, having teachers design projects for students can be just as beneficial as having students come up with their own ideas. It is an effective way to guide student learning and understanding, while still allowing students to express their creativity and come up with their own solutions.. 

Research has also suggested that when teachers structure and guide learning, it leads to better academic outcomes for students. 

In conclusion, having teachers design projects provides many benefits for students that they wouldn’t experience if they were designing them on their own. Specifically, when teachers designed projects, students reported feeling more confident and comfortable in their learning environment",1
"As a result, she grew up to be very artistic and proficient in multiple instruments. Through careful consideration and exploration of these external factors, a person can cultivate an abundance of positive traits and become their best possible self.. Over time I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence. 
One's character traits are often strongly influenced by the people we communicate with and the environment in which we live. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life. Spending time with them often pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take on new challenges. 

To illustrate this point, one of my relatives grew up in an environment where she was surrounded by art, music, and books. At a young age her parents exposed her to various forms of creative expression and provided her with the necessary resources and tools to be creative. 

Overall, it is clear that one's character traits are often heavily influenced and formed by the people we communicate with and the environments in which we live. For example, growing up I had a close friend who was very outgoing and adventurous. This would have not been the case had she not been exposed to the various forms of art and creativity in her childhood",1
"I try doing different way to learn. people that become success is because they have failure a lot of time during the process, and they work harder each time to do it better.

When someone success in something, they had failure in something one time in their career. Thats what make a person successful.

Failure is something that all of us do. For example, when I was 10 years old, i couldn't ride a bike. I away fail trying to ride it, but i never stop trying. Some times was because the customer din't like the work.

Now he know that he should do the work as the customer said and do the work better. Thats what make us do better in life. A failure can teach you lessons to do better that last time. All the failued that you took make you work harder and do way better. Do you think that you need to fail over and over to become success. Maybe the fail they took in their career is what make them successful. Sometimes he have lost a lot of money, or work for free, because he din't do what the customer said. My success of riding a bike was based on failure that teach me different way to learn something and better.

My dad have a company that he have work hard and a lot to archive what he have now. That why we have become successful in something in are life. That why a lot of people said that never gave up just for a fail that you can have. In the future, I hope people learn more from their failure to be successful in what they want to archive in their life. In this essay, I will argue about the important role failure plays in people success. They knew, if they dont work harder they wouldn't do any better. All the knowledge that my dad have now is by the failure. . If we all ignore are failure, we would keep failing over and over. Success comes from failure that make you have knowledge. He have learn that he should do what his job more better and do what the customer said.

Some people said that you don't need a failure to become successful, but they are wrong. He never loss his enthusiasm to make his company better, years over years",0
"Additionally, for students with physical or psychological disabilities, distance learning provides the ideal learning environment that caters to their individual needs. For those needing last-minute credits, distance learning provides the flexibility to take classes outside of traditional school hours. 

Furthermore, distance learning can provide more time for homework, rest, job-related activities, and visiting other places. Not only that, but distance learning can also open up opportunities for students to gain knowledge and experience in topics they may not have been exposed to while in a regular school setting. 
Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for high school students, offering a variety of benefits. This means that students may have more access to more specialized courses that may help them achieve their educational and professional goals. With the right resources and support, distance learning can give students the opportunity to develop their skills and fulfill their ambitions.. For students with jobs, distance learning allows them to complete school work around their work schedule, meaning they can manage both without feeling overwhelmed",1
"Depending on the type of shoe, it is important to ask people for their ideas on which style is best, as well as tips on size and fit. Consulting multiple people is a great way to gain a wide variety of perspectives, enabling a more educated decision-making process. This can help make an informed decision and potentially save both time and money. Doing research and consulting multiple people can help make informed decisions and save time and money.. In conclusion, asking family and friends for their advice and opinion when buying new shoes is invaluable. It is essential to ask people who are more experienced in the particular topic in order to get a better understanding of the specific situation. 
    After researching the opinions of family and friends when buying new shoes, it is clear that gathering knowledge from multiple sources can be hugely beneficial. Furthermore, consulting multiple people may lead to valuable insights that may have not been thought of before",1
"Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. My family was impressed at how much I've eatan. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it.

Another reason why Emerson's quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you've neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.

As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.

In contrast of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Another experience I had was in elementary school. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it",0
"Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up.                         . They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Online school is for every student. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. On the other hand, some students think online school isnt for visual learners but online class has many ways to educate visual learners.

Online class has video conferencing to help better understand. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

To conclude, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom",0
"Positive influence can provide people with the confidence and motivation to pursue opportunities in life and strive for success. Conversely, negative influence can be incredibly destructive, resulting in patterns of unhealthy behavior, low self-esteem, and disastrous decision-making. 

The impact of influence on people can be far-reaching. This can be an invaluable tool in helping individuals develop their potential. Positive influence exists when people are uplifted and encouraged to accomplish goals or achieve desired behaviors; for example, a parent conveying to a child praise or words of support. 
Influence, both positive and negative, is an unavoidable element of human interaction. Negative influence, meanwhile, can manifest as manipulation, coercion, or in cases of severe power inequity, even physical, mental, or emotional abuse; these can be particularly damaging as people can be coerced into damaging or dangerous behaviors that have both immediate and long-term consequences that can be detrimental to their well-being. For this reason, it is important to be aware of the dangers of negative influence and the power of positive influence.",1
"While the extra hour and a half of school time could provide additional educational opportunities, it is important to consider the balance of benefits and risks in order to make an informed decision.. 
After much research and analysis, it is clear that adding an extra hour and a half to the school day can have both positive and negative implications for students, teachers, and their families. On one side, students would be able to gain more opportunities to have more class time to complete their coursework, have additional tutoring, and benefit from other extended educational experiences. On the other hand, studies suggest that increasing the school day could also lead to higher levels of stress for both students and teachers, increased behavioral issues in the classrooms, and less family time. Furthermore, if parents are not able to adjust their work hours to accommodate the extended school days, this could lead to further challenges for the students and potential childcare issues for the families",1
"History is full of examples of people who have had to overcome failure and struggle in order to achieve their goals. She overcame numerous failures throughout her life, and ultimately achieved tremendous success due to her persistence and unwavering determination. His refusal to accept failure and continued perseverance eventually led to his success.

Another inspiring example is that of Marie Curie, who won two Nobel Prizes despite facing significant gender-based obstacles. 
No one has ever achieved success without making some mistakes along the way. Take the example of Mahatma Gandhi: Though he had faced numerous setbacks throughout his lifetime, he never gave up and eventually achieved India's independence from Britain in 1947. The most successful people in the world have likely faced numerous failures throughout their lives, but their willingness to take risks and never give up has ultimately enabled them to lead happy and successful lives. It can provide invaluable lessons and the opportunity to learn from our mistakes. Failure and setbacks are part of life, and how we respond to them can often determine our final success. It's important to keep in mind that failure is never an excuse for giving up — but instead, it should be seen as an opportunity to learn, grow, and ultimately, reach success.. Her story highlights how no amount of failure should ever hold someone back from their dreams.

These examples show that failure can actually be a key driver towards success",1

Spending time outdoors is an important part of life, for family and for oneself. 

However, beyond having fun and entertainment, spending time outdoors with family or by oneself can bring a sense of peace, relaxation, and joy. There are many enjoyable activities that can bring joy, stimulation, and relaxation if done outside. Through zoos, Disney parks, and travelling to different states and countries, one can explore the world and enjoy the beauty of the natural world.. Disney parks can also be a great place to get outside and explore thrilling rides, delicious food, and unique characters. Travelling to other states or countries can also bring one to a land of beauty, cultural newness, and a different way of life. Walking through a park, swimming in a lake, or simply lying in the grass can be a great way to destress, and give one a newfound sense of clarity and happiness.

One can observe the natural beauty of the world, get some exercise, and enjoy the company of others.

"Similarly, if students take classes in the evenings, and want to be enrolled in sports, or clubs, which require students to stay after school. Students have to study for all of their classes, do homework at home, and keep up with their classwork, so they won't get behind. This would enable students to be enrolled in elective classes like art, drama, music, or photography.

Some people may say that students finishing high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early, it's a good idea. It's really exciting because all that hard work was worth it, and you made it, but to get through you had to give up many of the activities you liked as well as your time. Students would need to take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Also, finishing one year early can be stressful for students. Imagine yourself getting out of high school early, and going to college or the workforce. They would not be able to participate.

If students finish high school early, they may not be able to take elective classes. Instead, students would have to attend to school, do homework, study for tests, and quizzes. All of these can stress students a lot, and won't have time for their own.

It's not a good idea for students to finish high school, and enter college or the workforce one year early. That is why it's not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Many students work over the summer, and having to take classes would not give them time to get a job. Students would not be able to take elective classes. This required classes are also important when getting into a college. However, it can be very stressful for students. Many students may not be able to take elective classes. Students must take classes during the summer. Schools should not offer students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early.. Having to take all the classes they need, can barely fit into their schedules. Finishing early can be very stressful for students.

Students finishing high school in three years must take classes during the summer or in the evenings. In order for students to graduate, they have to take required classes. Additionally, students have to do projects, and presentations",0
"Other times kids should learn from their mistakes. Here are some ways to try to have a good attiude during these times.

Getting a bad grade on a test or quiz. They dont know intill they try to do their best.

Having a good mindset can help. They should try to be more calm and the should try to not overreact at much. One way to provent this from happen is by having a good mindset. They could be telling theemselfs "" i'm going to fail"" or anything else instand of that they sould try telling them say ""i'm going to try to do my best. There are a lot of poeple these days that having a bad attiude during a difficult time. That everyone had to start from one place and build on. They can deepdown be mad, but if they put tell themselfs that ""i'll try harder next time"" they could do better on the retake or on the next quiz or test. Even when some kids that study a lot and fail some of they overreact during it.

Overreacting is another promble kids have. They might have or might have not fail and they shouldn't put it on themselfs because they could fail if not.

These are ways to provent kids from having a bad attitude to having a good attitude during their difficult time. Some kids overreact by saying ""if i fail this i wont get a job"". They should also try to have a good mindset during it.. Havin a good mindset meaning to think positivly and to know that not having passed their test or anyting in life.

Be yourself in the world is not simple, need to have good thoughts, these are the key for the most big accomplishment. Individuality

I am agree to be independent in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because you can feel proud of yourself. That is why I think that be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.. The biggest accomplishment only are caused when you do things for yourself. Also I think that do all individuality is not easy, but not impossible. Sometimes we don't something that we want for fear, because think that the result not going to be favorable or how you thoughts. Independent means that you have the control of the you doing, also signify not looking to others for one's opinions or for guidance in conduct. For example, when someone tell you do this, you need to think about it, and decide it is good or not , if is something bad that going to affect you. But you need have the capacity to show them, that you can and not need help for obtain it.

Accomplishment is the quality or ability, the result of something. I think that when you decide make the things for yourself is because you are ready to confront the different situations that the life give you.

The individuality is one that pursues a markedly independent course in thought or action. Some people no want that you win or protrude in the life, or not believe that you can do. I think that good thoughts can make you successful. Now know that you are able to do anything that you want.

In my conclusion be yourself in the world is good, because your learn about the life, also to do things that you not believe possible. For example, sometimes many opportunities came for your life, and you never accept. But when you take the decisions of do, you see that is possible. That means that your actions have influence in you, all that you doing have a purpose.

For example, when you want something but is spend, you work hard for it, and can get it. Make big accomplishment for yourself, teach you that you can do all that you want, but only if you believe and have trust in you",0
"If they have a brother, or sister that they have to take care of or they have to work two jobs to help there parents out. what i like about my school is that they let students pass there sol's with a 375 or more the ones that are in small group and that they need more help. also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years.

If there bad grades are low or GPA they can take a another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. There is a another way for them they can go to school summer and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they don't want to keep on going to school. I feel like if students want to graduate in three years or two years they should talk to someone like there teachers and they can ask them if there GPA is low.

there is a lot of ways that they can help them for an example if they are failing any classes then they can take some classes online, or if they can go to night school,or stay after school for more help. or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there where is two teachers.

I feel like my school they should let students graduate with a low GPA because there is some students that have a hard time keeping up there grades up like.    . but i feel like students shouldn't work while going to school because that how they get bad grades and can't bring up any grades up",0
"An Example is when you are a teenager you want to buy the best of the best pair of shoes to show your friends that you got something that they done But if your parents say to not buy them and to save the money instead to buy something better and more special later in life like a car there is were we should press attention to what they say about spending money because they are older there brain is fully developed and they know what to save for because they are older and have been here longer and know how to use money.

Thats why I listed to what the older grandpas and grandmas have to say when I do something Bad or incorrect because they pass that and know how it was and they want us to Be susses full in our on life and they share with us wisdom and experience and thats Important because they we can learn from them.. Someone the has share wisdom, and experience to me is my friend Generic_Name he has stage 2 cancer and he been fighting all his live he is someone I look up for as a super human he says that everything is fine and he just wants to enjoy his life he is an awesome friend funny he is everything that a friend could have he knows the real meaning of struggle he suffers daily from his deadly cancer but he is always happy We play mostly every day Me and One of my friends from school Generic_Name we play video games with Generic_Name and he destroy us. He is always happy and smiling he shows wisdom and makes other around him happy. They also been a live longer and knows how it works. Like my grandma she is good at cooking so I press attention to her cooking and see what new things I learn. My other person the shares wisdom and experience is my grandma.

She has share a lot of her experience of cooking I learn something new from her cooking ability she is a bit old but it does't stop her she has a lot of energy to make food for her family I learn from by seeing her cook an egg or make chicken I see her, and learn from her experience.

When we go to the beach my grandma always takes food so she wakes up early and starts cooking.

From the experience from my grandma I learn how to use spices and cuts of meats in a dish,

Also learn the amount of vegetables or spices that some dishes have my grandma been cooking for almost all her life she knows what taste good and what taste bad.

She teaches me how to cook some basic but delicious plates.

I think Learning from the experience of others is better because they been alive longer and know a lot about the topic like cooking, playing a sport, Driving, swimming or teaching they study or practice a lot that they became masters at it",0
"While this type of learning can be advantageous in certain ways, it can also present drawbacks that should be considered. Additionally, online courses provide students with greater accessibility to materials, classes, and educational resources than would be available without online learning. 

On the other hand, learning from home eliminates many opportunities that students would otherwise have when attending classes in person. This type of learning provides students with the ability to attend classes from the comfort of their home, allowing them to learn in an environment that is more comfortable and suited to their individual needs and preferences. Without direct human interaction, there can be reduced understanding or even confusion in regard to certain topics. This provides students with the ability to further their understanding of topics and stay up to date with new information. 
In recent years, the use of online and video conferencing to facilitate education has become increasingly popular. Additionally, there can be a lack of motivation and drive in completing work or engaging with tasks. While there are drawbacks to learning from home, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, and with careful guidance from educators, students can still have successful and beneficial educational experiences.. Students can complete their work when and where it is convenient for them, giving them the opportunity to develop their own schedules and manage their time more effectively. 

One of the primary benefits of learning from home is the flexible nature of the learning environment. 

Overall, schools should offer this type of learning as an option as it allows students to engage in the material in an accessible and flexible way. Students may struggle to maintain their focus and develop connections with their teachers or peers due to the lack of physical presence in the classroom",1

"you'll need to give it your best and try to give it all you got it could be on a test or it could also be on another problem in life by doing this you could achieve on being successful and end up doing great with no struggle or bad choices.

Final reason is that people end up saying that ""it's to difficult"" but by showing this people can make it difficult on themselves by not focusing or doing what your supposed to it can be in some situations where you have difficult times but in the end if you end up following direction or staying on task it could led to having a successful accomplishment.

As you have read that people should have any other way but to be always successful and always trying your best, you will end up failing but it's always good to never giving up. Only when will we ever end up failing that will always find a way to end up doing it correctly. Some people think that most people are consists on going with failure as a way that shows us that most people end up with failure again. It could be like saying it's a job and your been stressing out so much that you couldn't take it anymore so you decided to just call it quits, but for this problem people should always try there best and never let any other problems get into the way of their accomplishment, all ways stay positive and never lose on what you enjoy like giving up on it.

Second reason could be is that people don't ever try giving it their best it's always a been a problem cause some of the times people end up saying i'm not going to even try. On that day will we ever have to worry about failing.. One of minister Winston Churchill most famous quotes is ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I believe that most of the people should believe that success can be achieved only if you try but you will end up failing some of the times because first reason some people give up so easily and second reason they'll never give it their best some of the times and final reason is that people end up saying ""it's too difficult"".

First reason is that people most of the times end up giving up is because of the lack of things such as work or other sorts of jobs it could also be anything in life that people will give up on. They feel that it's true most people end up failing and end up doing the same process over and over again",0
"There are several advantages and disadvantages to taking courses online. Furthermore, several studies have shown that students tend to be less successful in passing online classes than in traditional classroom courses.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to taking online classes, there are also disadvantages to consider. It can be difficult for students to motivate themselves when there is no professor present and no regular deadlines and expectations. 
Online classes have been increasingly popular as technology advances and the need for social distancing increases. There is also evidence that online classes can foster student engagement as students are in control of when and how they access their education. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to take online classes should be made on an individual basis, taking into account student engagement, difficulty of passing, and student-teacher relationships.. Additionally, online classes make it easier for students to collaborate and communicate with one another in discussion forums or chat rooms. 

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to taking online classes. One pro is that online classes can be taken at any time and from any location, making them more accessible to people who have difficulty attending a standard class. Online classes also often lack the personal connections and relationships that come from face-to-face instruction",1
"
Extending the school day is a controversial issue that has split opinions among educators, parents, and students alike. . 

In conclusion, the decision of whether to implement an extended school day should be carefully assessed by the school and district, taking into account both the potential positives and negatives of such a measure. First, they point out that children could become increasingly overworked and overwhelmed with the additional amount of work. Additionally, longer school days could also negatively impact the quality of instruction, as teachers may have to rush through classes to fit in more material. Furthermore, they argue that an extended day will provide children with more time to participate in extra-curricular activities which can benefit the child’s social and emotional development. On one hand, advocates of extended school days argue that students will benefit from additional instruction time and schoolwork, allowing them to gain more knowledge and skills, and potentially earn better grades. They also argue that students need a break to be able to relax and reset after a long day of studying, or else they may become more susceptible to burnout. 

On the other hand, opponents of the extended school day fear that such a measure could cause more harm than good. Ultimately, the best decision should be what is most beneficial for the students and their overall academic success",1
"Failure sometimes make persons to stay in the same place, failure don't let people to keep going because they think everything they do is failure and never try again or be unsuccessful in achieving something.. Don't drop out your dreams if thing not going well.

Second, we need the enthusiams in our lifes no better if we failure, the enthusimas is the impulse to keep going and get everything like finish high schools, past the test, has a good grade but first thing possite and be enthusiams in things you really want to be successful in the future.

Third, the enthusiam is a great enjoyment, interest or approval . Enthusiasm is everything in life.

conclusion, I will said that Minister Winston Churchill is rigth because how i said in the beginning of my first paragraphs enthusiams is everything in life, we need to has enthusiams in everything we do to make it better. In my opinion, I gree with the Prime Minister Winston Churchill because the enthusiasm in the life is everything because without the entusiasm we are nothing, we can't go nowhere because we don't has the enthusiam, if we want something like jod, career, something the we want in life, we need the enthusiams first. We always need to thing possitive and has the enthusiams to do it again and get what ever we want in this life but always with the enthusiams because we need to has enthusiams to try again. Now i going to writting some example and information about the enthusiams and failure.

First, In this life if we not make a mistake (failure) we are not going to learn anything but we has to know if we fail we always has to try again and again no better what. For me, my enthusiams is graduate from high school to make mother proud of me because thats why she came to United State to give me a better future and now she enthusiams to see her daugther graduate from high schools.

Addition, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" in this quote said failure to failure is an instance of something not functioning properly but is not mean to give up just doing again but never loss enthusiasm to thing you love or want in the future just keep going make yourself proud of you and but never lost the entusiasm you has for things you love just because people talk bad things or thing is not good well, life give lesson to see if we are strong. Failure make people to give up when they mess up something but they has to keep going and doing thing possitive. I think everyone has interest in something and we can make it, we can has everything but if propose in life",0
"So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively.

Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. Haven't you got an advice from multiple adults in your daily life? Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. This is my thoughts on why some people would like multiple and how it can affect them in a certain way.. You could also use the people's advises you heard and give that advice to another person that also needs to hear it. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing.

He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one.""

Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced",0
"it's good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance.

In the other country's the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. it's rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 it's not to work his family have to support him to study. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosen't have to study too much because collage is easy that school.

I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didn't study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they don't like school the only reason they don't like the school is that they wake up early and they can't sleep. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years.

Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that it's not good to graduate early because you didn't learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they can't answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate.    . It's family responsibilty to tell his child to study. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he did'nt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity.

Working in school time is not good for student, because he can't learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he did'nt study he can't graduate. In my opinion it's not a good idea because in every country in world it's role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college",0
"Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online?

It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.

Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Which if they have kids or teenagers the online claeese can be benefitationl bacuse they can speent time with their kids and teen to see if they are doign good in school.

And the end the technology make the lifes easly and helpful;safe time,make anything be done on the time, so we can say technology refund the time for these who always busy.. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from honme by way of online video conferncing. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.

Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.

Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes",0
"Do you think is it a good idea for students to start a career at a young age under 18 or not,student should make their own choice. In some societies, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

First having a career in a young age,start work (having a job) and living by yourself. Your family will support you no matter what happen,you could go out with friend. money is like water you have then spend it, all gone.

Then the other choice not having a career in a young age,living their life to the fullness plus spending time with family and friends. you dont have to worry so much about paying bills and other things. At that age no one knows how to spend money or mange too. its like middle school and high school switch around youre pranging to live your life as adult instead living your life as teenage. At this point you could spend more time on studying mostly importation on yourself.

Be honest i dont think is a good idea,It take time to grow up to be young ADULT!!! Yeah sure everyone make mistaken but learn by it even if youre old,young it doesnt matter.",0
"While Michelangelo was never without ambition, he shifted his expectations and expectations of others depending on the task at hand. He knew that if he set too stringent requirements that he could not achieve, he would be worse off than if he had set lower expectations and achieved them. While he had to check his own hubris, Michelangelo was rewarded with numerous successes throughout his life, likely due in part to his ability to set realistic expectations and strive to meet them. 
The life of Michelangelo is an example of how setting your aim too high and falling short can be a greater danger than setting it too low and achieving your mark. His own experience and success affirm the danger of setting goals too high and not being able to achieve them.. He once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" 

This quote reflects his ability to recognize his limitations and adjust his goals accordingly",1
"These activities can even help to build leadership skills and reduce feelings of helplessness in teenagers. With careful consideration and proper oversight, it is possible that principals should require students to participate in these activities.. Knowing their teens are involved in community service activities with positive adult oversight can help foster mature decision-making. Finally, they are labor-intensive tasks that administrators must manage to ensure safety and compliance with state guidelines. 

Given this research, it is clear that proactively engaging students in community service activities can certainly have a positive effect on a student's physical and mental health, and can create a stronger sense of camaraderie and involvement in their community. For parents, there are also peace of mind benefits. For example, some students may not be comfortable or feel safe doing such activities alone. 
Recent research has indicated that there are many potential benefits to having students engage in litter pickup and community service, such as fostering a stronger connection to the community and increasing social-emotional skills. 

However, there are some risks associated with these activities. However, school administrators must put safety and cost considerations first, ensuring that both students and school staff are comfortable with the activities and that the added costs are covered. In addition, these activities can become costly for cash-strapped school districts",1

Self-reliance is an essential human characteristic that is both necessary and beneficial. They must navigate their surroundings, make decisions, and weather the consequences in order to secure resources and thrive. For example, a student who is struggling to write a difficult essay may need to rely on themselves in order to overcome the challenge. 

The thought process behind self-reliance is personal and divergent. Ultimately, self-reliance is the key to personal growth and success.. 

In conclusion, self-reliance is an incredibly valuable trait that is both necessary and beneficial. The decisions we make can have a considerable impact on the outcome, so it is important to consider all the consequences and think logically before we act. Seeking help and guidance from others can be helpful, but it is ultimately up to the student to make the final decisions and take the necessary steps to reach success. It cultivates a sense of independence and autonomy that is necessary for growth and personal development. It requires the individual to assess the situation, consider potential options, and weigh the pros and cons of each decision before making a final choice. It is the ability to make decisions and cope with the consequences, both good and bad, in order to achieve a certain goal. 

In real life, self-reliance can be seen as a problem-solving tool when faced with various obstacles. It is impossible to progress without the ability to make informed decisions and face the consequences alone. 

The same applies to nature, where animals and plants must use self-reliance to survive in their ever-changing environment",1
"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            . Students should commit to a career at a young age?. Many people thing that this would be an advantage in the future, because if many students choose a career when they are young, then there's going to be more professionals that can help the country, but other people thing the opposite, because they thing that the students are not ready to choose a career,because they are not in the age to thing by themselves. In my opinion, I would say that both arguments have good reasons to support their arguments, but l would prefer to be disagree with this opposition.

For my first reason, I would say that it's too much responsibility for their age, because they don't have the experience necessary to complete a career that they like, but they are not prepare to complete, however if they choose a career, then they have to worried about the college that they want and how much it's going to cost to them and their family to start a career, also because they are not going to take the career seriously, and it's going to be a waste of time in a career that they can not hold by themselves, so they are going to leave the career.

In addition, my second reason is that they don't have the ability to maintain a career mentally, because they can not control their actions and thinking, and if they do things wrong ,and they try to solve their problems alone, it's going to be stressful for them, what can cause a distinct kind of future that they don't expect , so they can get affect by all the things that can occur on your way, and also because there's going to be people that instead of help you, it's going to use for their benefits, and one example of that is the people who works in factories, construction, and bussines.

Finally, my last reason talks about how much time they have to enjoy their life, if they have to work in their career at a young age, because you can choose to be a professional when you are young and find jobs with that kid of career, but if you already know that you are going to work almost the rest of your life to have better future and keep progressing, so why don't enjoy your youth and be happy doing things that you like, instead of worry about find a career that if you are not ready, it's going to make you problems that you don't want to have now.

In conclusion, supporting with the reasons, I would like to say that the best thing to progress in life, is to find something that your are good, that you can control, and also something that you can make money with that,

however if know what you want to do in the future, and you know how you are going to try to make it possible, why don't enjoy what you have now, and leave the occupations for later, so you can concentrate in what you want now, before it's start to being late,because life is only one and we have to enjoy the maximum as we can",0

Technology has had a tremendous positive impact on individuals in many aspects of life, particularly in emergency, transport, education, and security. Overall, technology has made remarkable improvements to the lives of people in the areas of emergency, transport, education, and security.. In emergency situations, technology has enabled medical personnel to rapidly respond to emergencies with the use of sophisticated medical tools, rapid response systems, and computer chips that can detect health problems. Lastly, technology has had a positive impact on security with facial recognition, biometric identification, and surveillance cameras. In terms of transportation, technology has enabled advancements in autonomous vehicles, modern navigation systems, and real-time traffic monitoring. Education has seen improvements with online learning, personalized learning systems, and new virtual classrooms",1
"Self-reliance allows one to follow their own path and makes their own decisions. In our minds we think about different things in a situation, the good and the bad. With self-reliance, one is more keen on their own inabillities and strives to problem solve with a more in-depth and notable understanding.. An over-sized black hoodie and a regular sized white hoodie. Like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing. Then you feel like you're being held back by people who offer advice.

When I read my prompt for this essay, I struggled coming up with ideas and examples. Although guidance makes you sound weak, but we want to be satisfied with our decisions. Guidance is helpful if there are no choices that the person sees that needs it. Others can conduse issues more than solve them, at times. With guidance it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people aren't completely following their instincts. The prices are in the same range, a worker comes up to you asks if you need assistance. People are capable of making their own decisions. In nature, most animals get to be self-reliance in order to stay alive, for example, as bear gets older, their parents have to let them go alone in the wild.

We have voices in our minds that we talk to, and get really indecisive. People who are self-reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. These types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves.

We all value self-reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. The process of thinking about your ideas.

Our stance on the matter of self-reliance in humans stans to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. The thought of, what am I going to do, to make my essay satisfied so I can succeed? You feel like you need to find information yourself, managing your stress and time",0
"                            . Do you surround yourself with people who have goals in their life or inspire you to become a better you.?

It also takes part on things you choose to do and say on a daily bases. It also takes part in who you surround yourself with. It take's part on you and what you strive for in life.

In conclusion, Your own character traits are somethings that come within you and how you portray life. When you see someone in your life not doing well and not in a good current situation you want to avoid being in that position. But when you start seeing someone in your life doing better things and living the life that you want to accomplish, it's on your part to doubt yourself or make that you motivation. The decision you make could lead into something better or for the worse in current situations or in the long run.

Having motivation and a goal in the your life builds you as a person and sets you for growth. You have control over your thoughts and how you see things in life. The way you think has an effect on you as a person and how you betray things in life. You can have something to motivate you to be better then who you surround your self with. When you strive for something in life and start working hard for it, your mentality starts to change to do better and get to your goal.

Some may argue that the people you surround your self with is beyond your control on how your character traits are formed. But does everyone create their own characteristic traits or are they influenced by those they surround their self's with.? John Lubbock, a British naturalist and politician wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I take a position on representing that you are in control choosing and creating your own character.

In building your own character it's all in your mindset. Mindset takes a big part in someones character because it shows what kind of person you are and how you represent your self and how you portray things in life. Living on this planet, everyone has there own character traits. Your character traits are't something that is beyond your control but is something that you can control with motivation and a goal to strive for and it all comes from a strong mindet. Yes the people you surround yourself with everyday might have an effect on your characteristics, but it isn't beyond your control",0
"The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Let's to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills!

What do to improved our talking/people skills, it's important to get feedback from others and you don't even know when you need it of not. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. So why do ask other people for their own opinion to help us make the better choice, well by improving your people/talking skills, That most people are usually nervous to talk infrount of others, and how we organize what got from the opinions. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. That why I think it's better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion. Because this what want to say. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future.

Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. Questions like that are used in everyday life and it's always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But it's hard when you are nervous.

How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that it's important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. So I hope next time you can remember to use those skills in the real world.. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. Like here's an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and does'nt know what to do. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now I hear that a lot and why I'm telling you this it's because I don't want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more.

"To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus.

Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise.

Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus.

To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. For example,

Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. There is one option: students should not attend classes at home.. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home.

To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication.

Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home",0

Taking your own path and self-teaching can be very important life skills as they can lead to creative problem solving and a more independent mindset. Knowing where you want to go in life and taking the initiative to learn is a step in the right direction and is necessary to achieve your goals. It allows us to make our own decisions and take things into our own hands. He did this through his self-teaching, willingness to explore unknown territory, and refusal to be overwhelmed by the challenge. Taking your own path encourages self-directed learning, curiosity, and development of transferable skills. In today's world, it's our responsibility to adapt and grow our knowledge on our own as the world keeps changing - this is why self-teaching is more important than ever. Taking your own path can lead to achieving the ""impossible"" as it allows you to think unconventionally and explore outside the box. For example, Thomas Edison famously achieved the ""impossible"" by creating the lightbulb - something that was thought to be impossible. Ultimately, taking your own path and self-teaching are key life skills that enable us to think beyond what we already know and take matters into our own hands.",1
"Through careful consideration and exploration of these external factors, a person can cultivate an abundance of positive traits and become their best possible self.. This would have not been the case had she not been exposed to the various forms of art and creativity in her childhood. For example, growing up I had a close friend who was very outgoing and adventurous. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life. Spending time with them often pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take on new challenges. 
One's character traits are often strongly influenced by the people we communicate with and the environment in which we live. At a young age her parents exposed her to various forms of creative expression and provided her with the necessary resources and tools to be creative. 

Overall, it is clear that one's character traits are often heavily influenced and formed by the people we communicate with and the environments in which we live. Over time I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence. 

To illustrate this point, one of my relatives grew up in an environment where she was surrounded by art, music, and books. As a result, she grew up to be very artistic and proficient in multiple instruments",1
"I dont think thats good what they doing with the student because there school are not letting then choose there career or what kind of career they want to follow i think is a bad thing what they doing because they not letting the student study what he wants they are choosing what the student can and the career that he is going to follow , i say thatthe student have to say what he wants to be ansd what the they want to study.

From the point the im seeing the situation i dont think in those societies are giving, them a good reason for them to simmit a career,to the student because they are choosing the career for the students and they not letting them to follow a career, that they like because in school they are selecting the classes for the students ,that they are going to follow for only one specific career, and for the age ,that they have i dont think thats a good idea to summit a career because ,you have time to choose what king of career you want to follow and by taking classes for a career that you want and having the time ,and then you think your ready you can summit a career , because what they doing in the school is choosing what the student is going to be went he grows up.

They not letting the student to select there classes that are going to help then in the future for a career , in the school that they going they are selecting the classes ,for the students they not helping them , what they doing is ,that they are giving classes for only one career , and i dont think that they should summit acareer because, they not choosing a career that they want tey are choosing a career, that they giving to them with the classes that they making them have, so student dont have the much career to folow they taking whatever they giving to them.

in conclusion im not agree with what they doing with the student and they still not on the age to summit careers , went they get to the point at school is went you star looking for a career and what you like and what is making you follow the career and i would say ,that if u still in school it dont matter but the school they cant choose what you going to be you have to chose what you going to do and what you like the most and follow your dreams not what others say the you can do do or what you can be you have decide what you going to do the school is to teach you not to chose who you going to be.",0
"Is true that many students would like to graduate early with all the credits they need already, few students get to have that many good grades of all their school years the makes them able to graduate earlier,but of course, thats not something easy to achieve, some students maybe don't mind to taking all 4 years of high school to graduate,but others would like to take the 3 years and still get all the credits they need to graduate,even tho that may take them more work to do to achieve that.

I think it would be a good idea for students to be able to graduate with three years of high school, with the same idea that they will have to take summer courses and evenings to get all credits in three years, and the advantages of that would be that they will get out of school earlier and be able to star college, work, and a career at a earlier age, and also for students who don't like to spend too much time on school stuff, that would be like a way to get out of that faster and achieve their goals quickly, i have some friends that they graduated earlier because they had good grades, which made them have enough credits to graduate,and they doing good right now, because now they in college and achieving their goals, and i believe it would be a good idea to give other students the same opportunity, if they want to take it.",0
"

Research has shown that when students are left to their own explorations and interests after graduating high school, they create paths more suited to their natural abilities and strengths. Such success stories demonstrate the incredible possibilities that can arise when students are given the freedom to pursue a personal career journey without feeling constrained by preset requirements.

In conclusion, pressuring teenagers to determine their career path before they have had the chance to explore other options may have negative consequences that can hinder their future prospects. Requiring high school students to identify their future career can lead to poor decision-making, unnecessary stress, and a lack of exploration of potential opportunities. 

We live in a world where teenagers are pressured to decide their profession long before they can have a full understanding of the variety of occupational paths available to them. Examples of successful individuals who eschewed traditional norms to find success include Mark Zuckerberg, who dropped out of Harvard University after launching Facebook, and J.K Rowling, who wrote her first Harry Potter novel while unemployed as a single mother. It is important to create a supportive environment that allows young people to openly explore different career paths and discover the one that is best suited for them.",1
"Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.

In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.

People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.

Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done",0
"Most of the times it's really not more of a ""hey"" or ""how are you doing?"". Students spend more time on social media , games , and texting their friends more than doing homesworks or even reading a book. When teacher allow their student to use their phones most of them at times just login into instagram or snapchat. Instagram,Snapchat, and Youtube have impacted the lastest generations. High schoolers are always just on their phones texting one another and wait until last minute or the last day a assignment is due. Cellphones can be distracted and it will allow many students to fail courses or not complete asssignments. Students during class might've been waiting for so long to text their freinds back. This game is very addictive that those students who decided to play when asked to do research, their grades dropped straight down to a failing grade. Students really have long conversations and get carried along that they forget what they were asked to use their cellphones for. Texting can be the worst distraction for students and this is why they should not be allowed to use cellphones for ""educational purposes"".

In conclusion, schools should prohibit teacher granting permission to student to use cellphones during class. Imagine a classroom fill with students using their cellphones. Students should not be granted permission by any teacher to use their cellphones in class, it is a mistake.

A major distraction now a days is social media. This is why allowing students to use their cellphones can be a mistake,they are failing their courses.

Texting you're friends during class is the last distraction for a student. What do you think they are really using their cellphones for? Some students do not really use their cellphones for educational purposes but use it as an excuse to wonder off and get distracted with it. Social media can be a weapon in and out of school , it will distract students from their work.

Social media isn't the only distraction a student can have from completing class work. When a teacher of mine tells us to pull out our cellphones to do some research, I see more than half the class flip their phones and start to play this new game called Fortnite.          . I've notice that student at my high school download these new games on their cellphones. It can easily be proven by the amount of students that come after class and tell their teacher they could not complete their classwork",0
"A person point of view on someone can never changed because of the many thoughts that go throught the mind, after getting to know that person because no one would want a friend like that. Those all cahnges that you make in your clothes can make a difference and they don't have to be expensive of from a popular brand because all it is clothes is just how you use them and what makes it good that the clothes can be cheap but how you use them for the proper ocassion can make a difference.

In conclusion having a serious face,not taking care of yourself and the way you dress up can make people have diffent thoughts of you. When my satrted working as a chef people in the streets would see that her clothes would be all dirty with food stains it would make people think that they don't know how to cook and what is funny that she was making lots of money making food for important people and people was thinking of a different way when she was making more money than the people judging her, but when she started working as a nurse people would respect her for the way she was dress, eventhought she was not making the same amout of money, but people people saw her differently. Hygine can can change everything and lets people know about who you are and it makes people wanting to talk to you. Hygine is really important if you want to impress because otherwise it would make a bad impressions leading you not having friends or a girlfriend because no one wants to be around a person who smell bad and doesn't take care of themselves. People now days don't want to be friends with someone who is always mad and is ready to fight someone, and because of that particular time you had serious face it led to you not having a girlfriend or a friend that was going to be with you for the rest of your life. First impressions can be hard to change and its impossible because once you had that one chance you waste it all due to that one serious face that everyone was intimidated and now people don't want to talk to you because all it would've took was a smile.

Then,not taking care of yourself can make people not wanting to talk to you. All this small things can chenge your life because I have been through those situatioins where people look at you differently and it makes it hard to change someones thought of you and that first impression that is important. Having a diffent mentality can change everything and peoples way of thinking.. When being approche or even if they don't talk to you they will see that your not worth talking to and after they know who you are and your way of life style can make people hard to change that first impression of you. Having a bad odor can lead to people running away,can make you look like you just don't care about your'self why would you care about others. First impression counts the most and it's impossible to change. The smilling comes in quick too, because you have a friendly convertion with people around you and people wnat to be your friends and it may not be because you don't smile. Your breath also counts becasue people like to have a conversation without having to smell what you ate for dinner or what you had for lunch, so is important to saty up with all those things beause people take notice of all those small things and the see that is woth talking to you.

Therefore having the proper clothes for the proper time can change the way people look at you and it can make you have friends and be known for dressing good and people now days want friends who dress up good, for example is the homocoming dance and you go with your friends and you're wearing jeans and shirt and you have your friend all dress up for the occasion and theres you now no one wants to take a picture with you or dance with, dressing the proper way can make a difference on how people see you and is somehting that is a proven fact. Having a serious face, not taking care of yourself and dressing wrong can lead to having a bad impressions, thats when people think of you in a different way and get things wrong that are not true,but due to the bad first imprsssions it change everything.

Having a serious face all the time can mean lots of things, say for example you're life is horrible, your ready to go fight someone or it can mean I hate everything around me, thats not what makes a good first impression and it makes it impossible to change that",0
"Furthermore, experiences during a long vacation can affect a student's ability to pay attention in class, leading to a decreased understanding of the material. This is because of the physiological impact that extended vacations have on the brain. During a prolonged break, the brain is likely to forget more information, leading to fewer opportunities for recall. 
Recent studies have shown that having a longer winter break than summer poses a threat to students’ ability to retain information. To ensure that students stay on top of their studies, it is important to limit the length of vacations and create regular breaks throughout the year.",1
"Each person should take the necessary time to research and consider their career options. 
When it comes to selecting a career path, it can be challenging for a young adult to decide what is right for them. However, it is also beneficial for young people to explore new things during their formative years in order to discover their passions and hobbies.

For those students who decide on a career when starting college, there can be difficulties associated with sticking to the plan. It is important to remember that the decision can be changed, and there are ways that students can find and stay on the path that they have selected. On the one hand, there are benefits of committing to a career early on; settling on a path can help with focus and goal setting. This can lead to a more fulfilling career in the long run.. Weighing the pros and cons of each path is necessary in order to make sure that you are selecting the right one",1
"It was an amazing experience and I'll treasure the memories for a lifetime.. I felt a huge difference between the culture and lifestyle in Generic_City compared to the places I was used to, and it gave me a unique insight into the local customs. 
After researching the city of Generic_City, I was eager to visit and explore all there is to see. I stumbled upon the iconic Eiffel Tower, which I quickly snapped photos of from every angle. I documented the whole process with photos and videos throughout my trip to Generic_City. I enjoyed learning more about the city by interacting with the locals, learning about their culture and lifestyle",1
"For example, if you want to ask someone what you should do after graduation must come from you but sometimes you can ask questions to your family and talk about it, they might know what is the right thing you should do.

People agree with you taking your own decisions than doing what other says. Should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? People should make their own decisions because if you trust your decision there is no reason why you should ask someone else. Ideas are part of what you should take seriously in your life.                                                                  . However, part of your decision needs to come from your heart.

Firstly, If you want to accomplish a dream in your life you need to put some extra work trying to get it done. Other people who you should talk to are your siblings. If you take wrong decisions will cause you things that you don't want. When I saw my back yard full of leaves I ask to myself why did I make the decision of not cleaning the back yard. I would take my decision and ask my self should I trust them or not?

Secondly, trusting your team will not always be the same but you should follow your instincts. Also, getting it done is not going to be easy but sometimes you need to try. Always do what your parents says or ask you to do because they are the ones who wants you to accomplish your dreams, be there when they need you, talk to them when you need to. However, every day or every time you want to ask someone for help you must know who you are asking. Example, one day I made a bad decision of not cleaning the back yard of my house for like three months and it was fall and what happened was that it got full of leaves. For example, lets say you are a soccer player and you have a game but you don't trust your team mates what is going to happen is that you might lose that game. Other unknown person's decision is what you should never do in your personal life. Putting some trust on your decision can help you do what is right or wrong. I know is hard to trust someone who doesn't act or look the same as you. The idea of going to school should be one of the most important things you should do.

Thirdly, asking for help in taking a decision is not a bad idea. What I do when I have to take a decision of doing something is to think the decision twice.

In conclusion, never give up a decision of you doing the right thing",0
"For example student wants to graduate and wants to be a mechanic he needs to keep going in high school for four years he learn about that career he wants and another subjects.

Some people they do not like the idea for to graduate early because they do not think that is prepare for to go to college. is probably is the bigger reason why some people choose that opinion. Probably be more hard but you can do it, you need to try the best do yo have for in the future you will be a good person with a good job and can help your family. Some schools offer programs for students graduate in three years? students needs to go school for learn and be success in life in high school normally is four years but some schools give to students some programs for to graduate in three years. you need to pass all your classes in college but for that you need to study and try your best in high school that is the way for a good student .

Some people prefer graduate one year early , they has reasons, they wants to finish the career for to help the family or some people just finish the high school and go to work. a lot people think four years on school is good because in that years you can take to much classes. in four years you take more classes and learning about it. I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college

Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. College is a serious thing so all people need to prepare for to go there ,when you go to the college you have a idea that difficult be for you but not impossible . when help your family you are a good person and recognize that job was your parents did for you so keep going and do it a 4 years in high school this is good for success in life .. for me both reason is good because you need to stay in school for to be successful and understand why some persons wants to graduate early they wants to help his/her family so both options that is very good.

Four years in high school is the bets option can you choose because you learn more, study more, and prepare more , for me that is the good way for to successful in life",0
"
Our characters are shaped by a variety of influences, both external and internal. Despite this, I still believe that it is possible for people to choose their own path if they are determined enough to do so. Even our genetics and upbringing can shape who we become, something we have no control over. This brings me hope for our world today, and while some aspects may seem dire, I have faith that we can create a better future if we can strive to do better and be the change we wish to see.. These influences are often outside of our control, and can profoundly affect our development. There are countless examples of individuals who have overcome difficult situations and created lives for themselves that exemplify strength and perseverance. We are influenced by the people we interact with and the environment around us, as well as by our own personal thoughts and feelings",1
"Furthermore when you going to some other country that you don't know your way technology will helps you to find your way. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you can't go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you can't come today, if there was no technology it wasn't possible to do these things.

Second reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. That's why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. However that's good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. I believe that technology had positive effects on people's lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends.

The first reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Furthermore if you can't drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. That's when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator.

Technology had positive effects on people's lives technology helps people with more stuff, and they can use technology as a useful thing we use technology for everything.. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money.

Third reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. And we don't know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you can't ask question because you don't know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you can't talk or ask them for help. Technology allows people to complete many tasks, without having contact with others. Everyone should have technology because it's important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. For example if there was no technology we can't talk with our families that are in long distance",0
"By offering more exciting options, students are more inclined to come to school and make more nutritional food choices. 
The cafeteria at our school is an important resource for our students, offering meals that are both nutritious and tasty. In addition, we can offer more fresh fruits as part of our lunch menu options to provide even healthier meals.. To add more variety to our cafeteria menu, we can provide three new meals each week that incorporate fresh, healthy ingredients. With the same lunch menu options served every week, students may become bored with the same meals and make poor food choices",1
"However, someone people have skills, but are not confident with their self. I believe what author Ralph Waldo wrote is true.

First reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on your experiences, do you agree or disagree with Emerson's statement? Take position on this issue. In my experienced I wasn't confident I would be shy to present my project. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right , work hard and you will be successful.. Although, I got my first job and helped me a lot with my fear. I think if you don't work hard for what you want,you will never accomplished it. In my second semester i started bringing my grades to at least a C, to make my mom proud. Also believe in yourself and be confident, if you have skills use them. Now when my teachers asks who wants to present I will raise my hand first, so I can get over it.

Lastly, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my second experienced I was good at algebra and my other subjects, but my junior year I gave up when my grades dropped to a zero. Until this day I feel proud of myself too.

In conclusion, you should not give up on something you love to do nor let someone tell you what you can and cannot do. Practice or training will help you be successful.

Second reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote",0
"By consulting multiple people, you can gain insight into different perspectives and better evaluate potential success or failure. Ultimately, if you take the time to seek out multiple opinions, you can make more informed, well-rounded decisions that are more likely to yield positive results.. 

Making decisions based on multiple opinions, especially from older people, has many benefits. Additionally, older people often possess the wisdom and experience that can help guide the decision-making process. Their opinions and advice can provide invaluable context that makes decision-making easier and more successful",1
"On the other hand, it has created an over reliance on technology in many aspects of our lives and caused many of us to become more isolated from each other and more disconnected from meaningful activities outside of our screens. On one hand, it has brought unimaginable convenience and comfort, allowing us to stay connected with one another more quickly and easily than ever before. 
Technology has revolutionized the lives of people all around the world. Ultimately, technology can be a double-edged sword, and its effects on our lives will depend largely on how we use it.. The ubiquity of the online world has also opened the door for greater cyber security risks and threats to our data privacy. It has also made discovering new information and sources of entertainment easier and more accessible than ever before",1

As any writer knows, it’s important to have a checklist when preparing to write. This can ultimately lead to a resolution or compromise on the use of a checklist in the writing process. Research whether some writers would find a checklist to be too restrictive or even unhelpful in the writing process.

In the body of the essay, discuss both sides and present evidence to support each view of writing with and without a checklist. This summary section is the perfect place to link back to the initial points made about the checklist, and suggest that, ultimately, it can be extremely helpful in the writing process for those who utilize it.. 

When drafting an outline, take note of the key arguments of why using a writing checklist is beneficial. Consider using anecdotes or other examples to illustrate why one opinion may be more useful than the other. This checklist typically includes elements such as identifying the audience, developing a thesis statement, and planning out the structure of the essay or writing piece. 

Finally, draft a conclusion highlighting the importance of utilizing a writing checklist. It’s essential to be familiar with this checklist and understand why it’s so important to utilize it in the writing process. 

And while the consensus may be that a writing checklist is beneficial, it's still important to explore different opinions and perspectives. Consider adding supporting details of how the checklist helps the writer with organization, and developing a clear purpose and direction for the piece. To begin, it’s helpful to research what a writing checklist entails",1
"even if some people belief on praising,they think this help students to believe in praising i think students believe in this source but is not the principal option to believe in praising they need to focus in their achievements, values and skills because is one the priority and purpose to believe in their self-esteem this ideas must be to help to lean focus.

Students need to improve in their achievements, because some people are not sure if this come from, praise or achievements. Also students they has the last world, if they need to practice the things the some people thinking to the benefit for their self-esteem.

1. And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Reason some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree, i think this is not the best way to improve in their self-esteem, because students they believe in praising but, this is not the option to learn in their self-esteem they need to focus in their achievements. Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments.

Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students don't believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future.

In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand. Some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem even if the work is not the students best effort.

I believe that is not the best choose a student's to practice this work to build self- esteem; for many reason, because some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree this is no the best way to improve in their self-esteem to practice on praising. . I think this are two different thinks, also one is believe in religion, for example: I belief in Jesus this is praise they don't need to compare, but i don't dismiss this idea,because is good idea to students believe in praising",0
"From that experience, I learned that hardships can actually be an opportunity for us to get to know ourselves better and that failures are a necessary part of human growth. It was when I failed my college entrance exam, a situation which had serious consequences on my life. Because of my perseverance, I found other ways to get into college and eventually picked up a few new skills. It was this quote, and my determination to keep pushing forward, that kept me from letting my failure define me.

So instead of giving up, I chose to refocus my energy and use my failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. But something kept me going—the words of wisdom from Winston Churchill who famously said adversity can be a blessing in disguise. 

At the time, I was overwhelmed with emotions—I was embarrassed, disappointed, and discouraged. I had been focused on getting a good score on my college entrance exam for many years and it felt devastating to know that all my hard work had been for nothing. It was thanks to the words of wisdom from Winston Churchill that kept me from letting my failure define me, instead encouraging me to persevere and turn my circumstances into something positive.. 
As I reflect on my life, one moment of failure stands out above the rest. It taught me to look for the learning opportunities when things don’t go the way I planned and to not be afraid in the face of adversity.

Overall, I’m grateful for this moment of failure because it enabled me to grow in ways that I would have otherwise not been able to do",1
"Former British Prime Minister Winston once said that ""sucess consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiam and basically its asking me if i agree on it.

Basically i really have never heard about this prompt but i find it reallu intersting and would love to know more about it, I feel like if there were to ask me an a public place for example now but instead a public place and read about it more and even just reading a little bit about it makes me agree on it.

In my opinion i would definitly agree on it since what he said was pretty true, he basically said something that is basically true and not only that its basically making you think that it is right that ""sucess consists on many thing but for sure loss of enthusiams""which is not wrong now i feel like ive thought about it just couple minutes and its making me think alot about it specially how much ive failed and life and always got up back like nothing was wrong.

May not be true for many people but for sure for me,I would agree on it 100% without doughting it at all , its always the ones that have failed and gotten up who would agree on it, it could be tuff for many to accept it but eventually they would agree to it if they were to think about how many times they have failed and won there battled with fighting for it and doing basically what they really want in their life. so last i would agree to the saying of the Former British Prime Minister Winston it made me realize alot and a very true saying of course,                              . All you have to do to get through things are get stronger and work on yourself more, feel valued to your surroundings.

However, I have failed so many times and always thought about how i wouldnt make it not even how hard i try to i wasnt gonna make it out of the dark place i was in and eventually i told myself that it was very pointless of even trying anymore if all i was going to do is fail all over again , I didnt have no type of enthusiam whatsoever was horrible and all i did everyday was loss my enthusiam more and more until one day i got back up like a normal day and said to myself that ""Life doesnt get easier you only have to get stronger' and i realized so much at that moment i wouldnt even believe myself that i was up like nothing and day ago i was not in the right mindset thinking i was a completely failure and even didnt have enthuasiam for nothing",0
"Additionally, students would also be provided with an extended weekend, reducing the amount of stress they experience during the week. For instance, students may struggle to stay motivated and focused with the extra day off. Many schools are currently operating at a budget deficit and a four-day week could help those districts by reducing the amount of money spent on utilities, staff, and transportation. Furthermore, a four-day school week may also increase the likelihood of teachers needing to miss class and disrupt lesson plans. Additionally, it may be difficult to plan certain events such as field trips, sports games, and Parent-Teacher Conferences. 

However, there are several potential drawbacks as well. It is important to weigh both the potential cost savings and the potential negative effects of such a schedule in order to make an informed decision.. 
One of the primary arguments for implementing a four-day school week is the potential cost savings. 

Ultimately, while a four-day school week may have some benefits, a thorough assessment of both the advantages and disadvantages must be taken into consideration before implementing it at a school",1
If you leave me alone we probably we be cool and we wont have any issues with each other. I like to be my own personality because i know what i am doing and i am doing because i like it and when people told to stuff or me trying to be a different person just because they dont how i am or that way i dress or look. sometime i like to with work with groups but is all depend what type of people am working with and also how is my mood during the day of in the class. Also when am in class i dont like when teachers or student start asking me question where i am from or what do i like to do. And i cannot be a other type of person who i am not because i will be lying to myself and lying to the people around me just because i am acting different or look different for other people to think i am like that. Also i like to have my personal bubble because i dont like when teacher or student come to my face and start asking me about stuff that i do not know or when they give me a attitude so that is the time when the situation will star to get worse because every time when the happen i will do the same to do them but mine it will be worse and sometime i cannot control myself. I like to work alone with no body bother me . When am working like to listen to music because it let me to focus what am doing and i dont get distracted with the others student talking about drama or what is going on an there life or school. Or event class class if i am not talking with anyone the mean i dont want yall to talk to me or if i dont like the teacher i just keep my distance but if the teacher i dont like and she/he come at know where an start yelling at me i wont stay quiet and i will say stuff back to you because you just come to my face an start yelling at me for no reason so that is telling me that you got a problems with me and i didnt know at about it. Also if you think we are friends and you start to get conferees around me and you start talking about your life i am just going to walk away because i didnt ask you about your life because i am not interesting in your life because if i did i probably would ask you but if i didnt ask that mean i really dont care what do you do or what do you like. Been around people is not my type stuff i like to do i just rather to be alone and do my own stuff but if need help would ask someone who i think they know just go to the internet and try to found what i need online. Because when i work in group who talk a lot i cannot focus on my work or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when i get mad or when they trying to put me in there conversion that i do not care because if i am not talking to you or to the group that mean i am good and i do not need you or i dont need your opinion. If i dont like you you better understand i wont be nice to you and i wont try to have a conversation with you. Because i dont like to bother people just to do it or try my best to guess in the answer.. or sometime i like to work when the place is quiet because i can focus more and the place is quiet i can do my work in peaces. It is so ease if you respect me i will respect you back because if you come at mo where an start saying stuff to me and i really dont know what is going on i swear will disrespect you and say a lot stuff to you because you came to me saying stuff and every time that happen i really dont care if i hurt you or i hurt your feeling. so just because i couldn open the exhibit window am going to write about what do you i like to do in class. when the work in a group i like to work with people that wont talk to much and we do our own work,0
"in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students.

Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids.

If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures.

In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time.

During class time students might listen to their favorite songs on their phone and don't pay attention to the teacher which they will get a worst citizenship in their report card and they will not graduate and they will feel sad and shocked about what they have done to hurt them.

lastly these are the reasons that students allow and not bring their phones to school,. I think that students should bring phones to school but turn then off and put them in their locker.

If the students don't do that job they might be in a big problem",0
"People often make assumptions based on first impressions, whether it's a job applicant's clothing or the body language of a person they're meeting for the first time. Positive first impressions can lead to further conversations that help foster strong relationships and lay the groundwork for successful interactions in the future. On the other hand, negative first impressions can lead to misunderstandings that can damage relationships before they even have the chance to begin. An example of a positive first impression is when two co-workers initially meet and find common ground by sharing an interest in a certain hobby or activity. An example of a negative first impression could be when two people are meeting for the first time and one seems uninterested in what the other is saying, coming off as disinterested or rude. 
First impressions can have an immense effect on the success of relationships, both personal and professional. While first impressions may not always be accurate, they can have a lasting impact and it is important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others in order to create a positive impression.",1

"Moreover, every single human being on this Earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that African Americans gravitated towards. Influencing others to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives are all based on good examples that are set. Setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives.

The first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. gave a famous speech called ""

I Have A Dream

"" which radiated strong energy that gave African Americans the strength and pride to protest the whites' racist segregation laws. The most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. Martin Luther King Jr. A child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. At an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. Due to the fact that African Americans were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites' segregation laws was.

The second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. This can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. Those examples sets an image in people's minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. The great example set by Martin Luther King Jr. This inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. A personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. This is indeed the best way on influencing individuals.. Martin Luther King Jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many African Americans were involved in. Also, that person must retain an energy and vibe that coinsides with the other person for that person to be influenced. When people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. Also, It sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. Then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on TV decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration.

In conclusion, people better themselves due to influence. The examples set must give off something that interests the other person to be able to connect with the person. Having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset.

The final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives",0
" Similarly, technology has empowered people to form new friendships and learn about different cultures from around the world with just their phone or computer. 

Overall, technology is a valuable asset that has stepped up to tackle modern challenges.  For families separated by long distances, technology has provided a way to stay connected and in touch with loved ones through calls, video chats, and social media. 
 Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and its positive effects have been felt by families, friends, and the workplace alike. 

Technology also enables people to work remotely, which provides more flexibility and convenience. It has been a source of comfort and connection for people across nations, allowing them to remain closer than ever.. People can access essential tools online from wherever they are, sometimes allowing them to work from home or while traveling. This connectivity helps maintain a strong, close-knit family bond even when they cannot be together in person",1
"Until the time to make your own decision it will be even harder to make then the time you went for guidance. That you yourself will fell behind and lose whatever chance that you had because you never made a decisions for yourself and thats problem some people have because they have been going to someone else to make your life decisions.

In conclusion to go somewhere to seek guidance isn't bad it's what comes out of it to help you if it turns out bad or good it will effect your decision making to be better and worst.  . I feel like people making their own decisions will be a lot better for that person. But seeking guidance is that bad either for someone to make their own decisions says to someone else that they know what they are doing and can build something great with how their working and planning for the future.

Although seeking guidance is the worst thing to do, i feel like people making decisions for themselves is better.

For example if i were to go to someone for guidance or for something more and they give me some sort of guidance or idea and it turn out bad for me. Than i would never be able to go another person for guidance and ideas and i would most likely turn to myself. It still would have been a lot better for me so that i can use the experience of making my own decision to help make better one in the future.

Now if you go to the authorities and experts to seek guidance and it it come out great and now your life is going great. Then theres the problem that the reason that i went to seek guidance was because i couldn't make a decision for myself and now since I'm self reliant it will be hard for me to make my own decisions.

Now if i didn't go to the authorities and experts and made the decision for myself but it still ended up being bad outcome. In my opinion making your own decision will be better then any expert ideas because it help yo in your life and what comes after every decision you make for better or worst",0
"The third problem is the student work on summer break most student are get their job during the summer. Should school have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall? People said most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. On summer you can spend more time with your family, or go visit cousin. When summer come you, and your friends plan to go on vacation together because all of you have the same summer time even if ya'll come from a different school. Some people say their should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and week off spring and fall. For a student work in the summer is the best choose when you work on summer you can save a big amount of money to use during the year, and don't have to go work during school year, so you can be more focus in school. Traveling is not all about playing around didn't learn anything, but you can have your choose of where you want to go, and what you want to do. The 3-4 week summer break is too short for students to have a chance spend time with their family. For overseas students that even worse they're study in a year, but still don't has a chance to come back to see their family just because the short amount of time that they have for break. During school year we can't come back to our country to celebrate holiday like Christmas, or mother day...etc. There are a lot of different thing that you need to get ready to go to another country, so you can't get everything done in a week of spring break. It's the tour during summer break with your teacher, and your schoolmate. There are one type of travel that I think is really good for student that they're going to have fun, experience, and still learning. Because this is the only time in the year we can come back to the motherland to meet us family, and visit cousin. Because all the schools doesn't have a same winter break, or spring break that is the reason why you, and your friends can't go to vacation together. Because with the amount of time you available to work for them, they will hire you. Summer are the students break, but their parent still have go to work. Cause travel in a different country you can learn new thing that you never learn anywhere, or experience the thing that you learn in school like go to a history site that you learn from history class. However I disagree with this idea I believe there should be a long summer break by that student can do what they want, and still learning new thing. When students have enough time to enjoy them self in summer it will help them return for school in a exciting way, so they can learn faster. The second thing you can do by have a long summer break are spend time with your family, and friends. . I think a long summer break is the best time in a year for students travel overseas to study in the United State like me. However I believe that students should have a longer summer break because a long summer break will give the student time to travel, spend time with their family, and work in summer. It's will help the student return to school without forgot everything that they have been learn. We have to celebrate a lone because the limit of the time won't let us make it home. A long summer break will help the student overseas spend more time with family because there are enough time for them to get ready, and travel a long way home. Family is the most important thing for everybody. It's recommend by school where you can come to a country that you learn about their language, and culture in school. With a week off in winter break, or spring break you can't find a job because the short amount of time. By travel overseas you need time to explore the country go around the city, and enjoy yourself. Some people argue that there should be year round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The first thing you can do by having a long summer break is travel overseas without worried about how many day you can stay. For students that live in United State you can go travel with your family to make more memory",0
"For example, in places where curfews are strictly enforced, it can have a negative effect on the teen’s safety by causing them to flee from or avoid law enforcement during an emergency. Generally, a curfew is imposed for the purpose of protecting teens by limiting the amount of time they can be out of parental or adult supervision. Advocates for strict curfews indicate that this practice has potential benefits like reducing teen delinquency and crime, reducing the risks of young people falling victim to drugs and alcohol, and creating a sense of order and structure in a youth’s life. When curfews are enforced properly and in moderation, they can be effective in promoting safety and instilling good habits and values in teens. In addition, it can over-restrict teens, hampering their ability to develop healthy time management skills and even negatively impact their academic performance.

Ultimately, it is up to parents and guardians to assess whether curfews are appropriate for their teens and how they should be implemented. 

Critics of curfews argue that these rules may be counter-productive in some cases. Ultimately, curfews are just one of many tools available to parents and guardians to ensure their teens’ safety, wellbeing, and success.. 

When it comes to the issue of curfews for teenagers, opinions widely vary",1
"On this times young people study about photograph, edition, effects, agriculture and more because that is the feature, but we need to be careful because if we carelessness the future can be horror.

The technology is too important for the world. Here are some negative and positive reasons that technology cause to the people.

Many people lost their time with play games, for example, 75% of childhood and young play games every day thats means that more than 1 million of kids take their time with games, so the consequence of the future of this generation can be different because right know children's starts to loss communication with parents or starts to be aggressive with others. I'm just thing that we need to be care for this if we want a good feature, So one thing we can do is to get more communicate, friendship, share with people, go outside, visit the nature. There is positive reasons and negative reasons it just depends what you care more, Technology or the world, and i'm not saying that we need to eliminated the technology. thats a negative reason.

Now, technology helps a lot because makes more easy on people's lives. Technology is a tool for the human to amuse because people can check out books,shop, and play games without speaking to another person, but at the same time technology effects on people's lives. in the positive way or wrong way.. If we still do those things our feature will be pretty good.

To conclude, Technology is a tool for the human to amuse, It's depends how we used. for example, During the time technology creased every day, exist apps that you can use for jobs and apps that you can use to contact others easier",0

Second, set a good example for your peers. Showing leadership in the classroom or hallways can have a positive impact on other students and help them stay out of trouble. Here are three of the most important: 

First, choose your friends wisely. Having friends who are successful academically and stay out of trouble can help you stay focused on doing the same. 
Staying out of trouble in school is essential to making sure you're able to stay in school and graduate on time. It's no secret that the people around you have an influence on your behavior. There are many ways to stay on the right side of the law and out of trouble while in school. Be a role model and mentor to your peers and you'll set a good example of what it looks like to be successful in school.

Finally, establish positive relationships with school staff. With the right approach, you can ensure that your school experience is trouble free.. Seek out the help of your teachers and school administrators when facing challenges and you'll be further away from potential legal issues.

Overall, staying out of trouble in school involves making good decisions, setting a positive example, and forming positive relationships. The more positively your teachers and other educators view you, the less likely it is that you will get in trouble",1
"Also we put our effort to do the work and that the teacher see that we all work together. Also if you're partners help you with the work the teacher is going to sacrifice with the work that all of you are doing.

We all do the work more faster than doing the work alone. In my opinion working in group is better them working alone. Also we all can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. Also we can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. Also we try to do the work fast but also we try that the work look good. . But if you are working in ground and the group is doing nothing if better for you working alone in that situation. Also everyone participate in the work. And if there is 4 in a group we all 4 do a list one part of the work. And that way we can finish the work fast. For me it better working in a group have many beneficial and is very helpful to do the work good and nice foe the teacher can be proud of the group work. And we all have some part of the credit. Also in a group there is always one or two person that know how to draw, have a good hand writing, or know how to decorate, and one that is looking the thing we need in internet for the work. Because we try that everyone have one part of the work. Sometime it because the teacher a specific time to finish and with a group we can finish on time and also the work can look good too.

We don't feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing the work alone. Also we divide the part to every person and we all are attendant that the work do okay. Because you have to intelligent and organize first and everyone know what they have to do we all can get a good grade in the work. We don't feel the work hard because we separate the work in parts. And we try that the work look good and nice. It working in a group more better or we get beneficial them working alone?

working in group have many beneficial them working alone. Some of the benefits that we can get working in groups are. Work with friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Because working in groups have many beneficial that we can use wisely. And we no just do the work fast because we want to finish quick and them do nothing. Also working in groups it help to the development. And we all put our interest to do the best as we can with the work. Because friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. And friends or partners can be good if we need to do a drawing or with the hand writing. And we try our best to do the work the way that she or he wanted to be. And final we don't feel the job or work hard s we usually felt doing alone. The job is more easy to do if there if more than one doing the same work.

In my final opinion I think that work in group it better them working alone . And also is mire fun to be in a group with your fiends and all of you get a good grade. And we don't feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing alone.

Friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple",0

On the other hand, although graduating early will help save money, students who choose this route may not have had the opportunity to take as many classes as those who completed the traditional four years. Additionally, graduating in three years may leave students feeling as though they are missing out on a major part of their high school experience in the form of sports teams, clubs, and other activities.

In my opinion, students should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early before making the decision to do so. 
For students considering graduating high school in less than the traditional four year time frame, there are several advantages and disadvantages of that choice to consider. Graduating early also allows for increased college course work in the remaining time, giving students the opportunity to impress college admissions offices. The most significant advantage is cost savings; students can save up to half a year's tuition by graduating in three years compared to four. Ultimately, the decision is a personal one and should be taken into consideration with care.. When it comes to college preparedness, this is an important factor to consider. It may be easier to get ahead in college preparedness through a three year plan, while maintaining the full high school experience and taking all the available classes may be the best fit for others. Graduating early can be beneficial depending on the individual's goals and needs",1
"if someone is out their struggling or having a difficulty time doing something, the adult that was ones a students and helped out younger student's will automatically know what to do and how to help the one's that will need help. They learn and learn so when a student is a fully grown adult they know what is expected of them and how to assist other's if needed also they will be more mature and will know how to act. They might fight but at the end they will later then respect each other and they will learn how to communicate with each other. That is why they might have this program so student's can get the feeling of how it feels helping out someone and so the younger student's can learn how to read and get the feeling of how it the sensation would feel if they had sibling's at home. Some School's have program's that teacher's allow student's to pair up with younger one's at the Elementary School's. This is the reason this program is so helpful and I hope they keep having these things for student's in the past and will continue to help them in the future.. The older student's assist out the younger one's on how to read, comprehend and to get the understanding of how books are read and what they could be used for in their future life, this is the reason older students are so helpful and useful.

Another amazing this program is useful is because for those student's that are home alone and have no older brother's or sister's, this program helps them get a understanding of how it feels having sibling's at home. I think this is a wonderful and interesting idea because it interests kids and makes them want to return to School and love School if they are having second thoughts about School, for example if they do not like it and don't want to return, having a buddy might want to change their mind because they can only imagine the fun and exiting time they can have with their buddy!

Teachers's, Principal's and other member's like the School bored did a smart plan of creating this fantastic program of older student's assisting out the younger student's and teaching them a thing or two about certain things. This program entertains and not only that but also influence's younger student's on how it feels having a sibling at home and the amazing time spend with each other as well. In some School's not only do teacher's assist student's but now student's beginning do the same for younger one's at School. School is important because student's learn from their mistakes and then next time the same problems happen to them they will learn from it and make it better then the first time. The reason why this program is helpful for both younger and older student's is because this program impacts both younger and older student's, it impacts the younger ones because it teaches them how to read and write and it impacts the older student's because they learn how to assist younger ones and how to communicate with them. Younger student's look up to the older student's and the older student's are known as role models because they are much more mature and that is why younger ones look up to them. This great program will help out student's right now in class and also they will learn how to use these skills in a daily life and maybe on their everyday lifestyle and job's.

When a student or any person assist out another, at the end they will always feel proud about their self's and they will want to keep on helping others in their daily life. In this program student's do game's read book's and so much more exiting activities. They do this to help out younger students that are just beginning school and are scared and don't know what to do in School or how to react because of their first time being in School",0
"

The availability of these classes can also provide schools with the potential to reach and engage with a broader range of students. By providing online or virtual classes, students have access to additional educational opportunities that can help prepare them for the future. This can open up opportunities for students who do not have the resources to travel to classes, while also creating a comfortable learning environment for those who feel anxious or overwhelmed in a traditional classroom. 
Offering classes online or via video conferencing to students who live far away can provide numerous advantages for both the students and the school. For students, there is no longer the need to drive or take public transport to the school, which can help save them time, money, and energy. 

The remote learning options can also extend beyond physical boundaries, allowing students to take classes they may not have access to locally. By offering the opportunity to take classes online or via video conferencing, the school has the potential to attract more participants, increasing their student body size while also having a positive impact on learning.",1
"It can provide us with a sense of purpose and accomplishment, and allow us to gain new skills and knowledge. Working toward a goal gives us focus, motivation, and a strong sense of achievement. 
Inactivity may not seem like it has much of a purpose, but engaging in activities and striving for a goal can have many benefits. For example, if you are learning a new language, the more actively engaged you are, the better your recall and understanding of the language will be. Therefore, it is beneficial to always be doing something, even if it is just taking small steps.",1
"If you do four years of High School instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. Students who choose to stay after school to take extra classes, will have to stay in school longer, so they can learn all the material for the subjects that they are taking after school.

Students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. I believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they won't be taking any electives. In many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means the student will most likely have to take two classes of one subject to earn the credits for that one specific subject. They will be stressed because they're going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. I don't think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. Students who choose to do summer school don't have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer. They wouldn't be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy.

This is why I think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. This is why it's better to do four years of High School. Some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they don't understand the material being taught.

Most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes.        . Students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. For these reasons, I don't think school districts should allow students to graduate early.

Students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. Same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done",0
"Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well",0

After researching different career opportunities, I identified a particular career of interest to me: video game designer. I analyzed the skills I learned in high school and considered how they could help me in my chosen career path. I also spoke to someone who currently has the job to gain more insight into the career and to how I could go about preparing for it. Ultimately, I determined the dedication and passion I would need to have to succeed in this field..

"Some schools in the United States should not offer online classes for their students because they could easily become a substitute for vital social interaction and can lead to a decrease in the overall quality of learning.

For many students, online classes remove the compelling motivation of being in contact with their teachers and peers. Social interaction is a crucial part of learning, as well as a student's development. 

In conclusion, the potential risks that come with online classes are not worth the convenience. By exclusively taking online classes, students miss out on learning skills such as public speaking, participating in group activities, and working collectively with peers. If students are used to exclusively taking classes online, it poses the risk of further isolating them from the world. Without this real connection with people, it can become extremely easy for students to neglect their work, skip assignments, and procrastinate more than if they were physically in the classroom. Schools in the United States should not offer online classes if it means compromising the quality of education and decreasing social interaction for their students.. 
Online classes can be a useful way for students to receive an education, but they also come with risks that cannot be ignored. Without this condition of accountability, students are more likely to receive a sub-par education.

Furthermore, it is impossible to replicate the real-world experience from a computer",1

Many people today likes give advises to others, sometimes about their life, work or personal relationship. For example, someone who was a bad person in the past and now he change. You are influencing that person with reasons, examples and actions, he can change himself. Influence people is not easy, you need to be prepared with the examples they need to ear.

In conclucion, the only way to influence people is with examples, actions, reasons and your personal advise. You can change bad relations or yourself . But the question now is, ''Example is not the main thing in influencing others; is the only thing? I think it is, for two main reasons.

"While there is potential for more in-depth learning, some students may not be able to keep up with the extended school day. With two additional hours of school, student fatigue and stress build up more quickly than before. Bus routes need to be adjusted, and many school staff such as custodians and cafeteria workers may not have jobs available every day due to the school closures on Fridays. This presents a problem for lower income and tax-dependent schools.

A four-day school week with two additional hours of school can have many disadvantages that must be taken into consideration. A longer school day also has the potential to affect our students’ health; some have argued that these additional two hours of school could lead to mental and physical exhaustion, headaches, and difficulty sleeping.

In addition, this schedule does not allow for flexibility in learning; some students may have difficulty handling different areas of the curriculum. 
The idea of a four-day school week has been gaining traction among many school districts recently; the idea is that by condensing the school week into four days and increasing the amount of time spent at school during those days, the amount of time each student has to complete their schoolwork is increased. Furthermore, after-school activities and extracurriculars would be more difficult to manage with a four-day school week.

Finally, it’s important to consider the practical side of the four-day school week. While it may be beneficial in certain cases, there are potential problems that must be considered before implementing such a system.. However, there can be major disadvantages associated with this schedule.

The main issue with the four-day school week is the length of the school day. This can detract from the quality of student learning in the long run",1
"Another is if they need help with something and on one is with them .            . Dear, Principal

I think that you should allowed the students of your school to use there cell phones when they have the time to. One because they want to time in school to call friends that may not be in the same school or if they have an important thing to do after school in they can't go. But also to remember that they have the right to use them. Will this is why I think that allowing the students to have there phones with them is ok. will there can be a punishment to that person that dose not flow the rules. You can assigned any thing to that person like after school clean up or Saturday school something like that so that they know not to do it again and that they need to lessen to the teacher when they are ask to well that is all i have to say principal. The students should have in mind that when the teacher ask them to put it always that they well. Now I what you might be saying that the students are never going to leave their phones not even if there in class",0
"

First and foremost, allowing cellphones in the classroom can help students to be better organized and complete their assignments more efficiently. 

Throughout the past few years, the emergence of technology has opened up a myriad of possibilities for student success both in and out of the classroom. 

Furthermore, allowing cellphones in the classroom for educational purposes can also help students feel more at ease in their learning environment. Furthermore, by having their device at hand, students can easily stay focused and engaged as they will not need to leave the classroom to find resources.

In conclusion, there are many positive effects of allowing students to use their cellphones in classrooms for educational purposes. In addition to this, students could also utilize apps to help manage their time, schedule study sessions, and keep their work organized. Not only can students benefit from easy access to online resources, but the use of cellphones in the classroom can also help students better manage their time, collaborate more efficiently with their peers, and feel more comfortable and engaged while learning.. As a result, students do not have to worry when they may forget something or have a question about an assignment. With their devices, students can quickly collaborate with peers to collaborate on projects, ask for help when needed, and send last minute reminders. With the introduction of cellphones, specifically, students around the world have the ability to utilize their devices to find resources, complete school assignments, and check their grades whenever and wherever they may be. As a result, allowing cellphones in the classroom for educational purposes has had a number of positive effects on both student achievement and the learning environment. For instance, when a student has a question regarding their work, they can quickly access any resources available online for more in-depth information. Moreover, in regards to students who need a refresher on specific material, they could easily find related videos, articles, and other sources to gain a better understanding of their assignments",1

Adding variety to the school lunch menu has the potential to provide students with appealing, nutritional meals. Additionally, a survey was created to determine what type of food would be most popular among students. From these findings, five different foods were established to be added to the school lunch menu: pizza with whole wheat crust, vegan enchiladas, turkey sliders, bulgur salad, and eggplant parmesan. To explain how a new menu could benefit students, a presentation was created detailing the health benefits of the new menu items. With these menu additions, schools can offer students nutritious, interesting meals that they can look forward to in the lunchroom.. Popular menu items from the survey included hummus with pita bread, whole grain wraps, and vegetarian sushi. To assess the needs of the student body, we conducted interviews with students to better understand what type of food they would like to see in the menu",1

"I believe by going to high school for four years students will be able to get more experience and enjoy the best time of their lives. The four year plan allows the student to have some elective classes. I had to take all the mandatory classes in my first year in order to be able to graduate on time. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to enjoy their lives with their family all year long, because they will have to study in order to pass their class and graduate. I was not able to take any elective classes, which put me under pressure and made feel bad, because of the amount of homework and the number of hours i used to sit in my room and study.

Students in high school should be enjoying their lives. This is a very important important subject to me Thank You fore giving me the opportunity write about it. I am pretty sure that students who do the four year traditional plan will be doing better in school because they are not pressured, unlike the other students with the three year plan. Students might not be able to have any elective classes, these classes are made to be easy classes that help student do their favorite hobby like playing guitar, piano and sports, these type of classes help students remove the stress from their brains by doing something they like. The three year plan does not let students have their free time to hand out with their friends or do their favorite hobby. Independent students can not do the three year plan because the will not have any time to do anything other than work and school. I was born in Egypt i moved to the United States in 2015, which was my freshman year of high school. We all know that social life is important to every single one of us and, it affects how we do in school. The traditional four years of high school does not put the student under pressure, unlike the three year plan. In my opinion i believe that graduating in four years is a lot better than, graduating in three years. For example i have a job i live on my own and i do not as my parents for any money or anything in order for me to do the three year plan i will have to quit my job, so i can be able to focus on school or else i will fail in school and not be able to graduate and if quit my job i will have no source of income to take care of myself and pay for my rent, but i do the four year traditional plan and i have a good job where i can focus on both school and my job so i can live.

In conclusion the three year plan is not a very good decision to make and everyone should think twice before deciding on it. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to do anything but study and do school related stuff which causes a lot of people depression and anxiety. My friend used to hangout with me all the time but he did not because he had to go to summer school, he was telling me that he was not happy be cause he would wake up go to school finish school, go straight to work, come back from work do his homework and sleep, he barley had time to eat, which made him very tired mentally and physically.

Some of the students in high school are independent, they live on their own have a job and dont ask parents for money. The three year plan helps students graduate faster but it also, it does not give people time to enjoy the summer or have free time to do their favorite hobby.

High school is the best time of every student's life, because in high school students do not have a lot of responsibilities. Last year one of my closest friends had to do summer school, every time i call him he barley answers and says that he can not hang out because he got school related work to do. The three year plan will not give you time to have a job if you need one. Thank you.. That plan also does not give people time to have time with their family or the people they love. Students who decide to pick the three year plan will be making a big mistake",0
"Thinking about their future career gives students the motivation they need to stay engaged and focus on their academic goals. It can also provide clarity regarding their educational options and create opportunities for advice from teachers, mentors or peers. Planning for a future career helps students to stay motivated and focused in their academic pursuits.

When high school students are thinking about their future careers they become more engaged and invested in their academic studies. Young people are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available, but articulating the path they want to pursue after high school can make it easier to decide what type of school to attend or even whether to attend college at all. Despite the anxiety, it is important for high school students to begin investing in their future career. It is less about knowing exactly what you want to do and more about setting a goal. 
The world of work is constantly changing, and uncertain job markets can make it intimidating for high school students to even think about their future. Focusing on a future career endeavor gives them the motivation they need to aim for higher goals, challenge themselves academically and learn skills that will be beneficial to them in their future careers. For these reasons it is important for high school students to start thinking about their future career.. By running career paths by friends, teachers or mentors they can gain helpful advice as to what paths might best lead to their aspirations.

Anxiety about the future may lead to procrastination, but planning for a future career is an essential part of being a high school student. Knowing that they are working towards a specific goal that they are passionate about is what regularly drives students to excel in their classes.

Considering their future career can also provide a better understanding of their educational options",1
"It increases our capabilities to see opportunity, rather than danger, in the face of failure. Moreover, research has shown that having a positive attitude can make it easier to focus on tasks and circumvent negative emotions. With a positive attitude we can reach our potential and achieve our ambitions.. 

Despite these advantages, there is a debate about whether having a positive attitude is necessary for success. Positive thinking makes it easier to view a problem as a challenge, instead of an obstacle. 
Having a good attitude in life is strongly associated to success and resilience when facing challenging situations. There is evidence that hard work, resilience, and talent are all equally important to attaining success. It gives us the courage to face difficult situations and helps us to channel our energy into productive tasks. 

In summary, having a good attitude is an important factor for becoming successful and achieving your goals. Nonetheless, having a positive attitude in life greatly increases the chances of achieving both short-term goals and long-term objectives. Studies have shown that having a positive outlook on life can help us overcome adversity, and can ultimately lead to success",1
"When we help others out, we create bonds that can last a lifetime. 
Learning from other people's experiences can be an invaluable resource. By gaining insights from those who have gone before us, we can become more prepared for our own experiences. Hearing stories about others’ successes and failures can make us more informed and get us better prepared for our own journey through life. We can pick the brains of people who have gone before us, build relationships, and grow together. 

In short, learning from other people's experiences is an indispensable tool for achieving a better life. Whether it's hearing stories about someone's successes or struggling with their own journey, taking time to listen to and learn from someone else's experiences is often the best way to make sure we don't make the same mistakes. Knowing someone else's challenges and their solutions ahead of time can help us steer clear of potential pitfalls. We can study their approaches, their successes and their failures, and use that knowledge to our advantage. We learn from the past, but more importantly, we build for the future. 

Moreover, learning from other people's experiences allows us to develop connections with others by building relationships and sharing ideas. 

On a larger scale, learning from other's experiences can help us understand the nature of reality better and put us in a better position to make more informed decisions. In this way, learning from other people's experiences can be a powerful tool for personal and collective growth.",1

Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Some people don't like to be always doing something; however, do we accomplish more if we are always doing something. To summarize, we have to focus and do always something and achieve our goals.

In conclusion, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we don't get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose. Also, when we do something different each day we don't get bored because we don't repeat the same routine each day. Also, when we wat to get a job we need to do always something and go to find a new job to have our own money and be responsible. For example, if we are in high shool and we want to graduate, we have to do always something like go to school everyday, do our homeworks and pay attention to have the opportunity to graduate. We can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we don't get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose.

Firts, we don't get bored. I think, if we are feeling sad, or we are having negative thoughts we can start to do always something to distract our minds and feel much better. To conclude, It is important to do always something to have a good and healthy life.

Finally, we can achieve what we propose. For these reasons and many more its important to do always something and we can accomplish more.. For example, if we are in our home and we are doing something like cleaning the house, or cooking we don't get bored easily because we know how to spend our time. Another example, when we are doing nothing during the day, the day feel so long, but if we are doing something during the day, the day feel faster. Also, if we are always doing something we are gona fight for what we want and we are gonna be better persons.

Likewise, having the freedom to make your own decisions pertaining to personal relationships can be invaluable, while relying on the input of others may often lead to feelings of discontentment and unhappiness. Being able to act in accordance with your beliefs and values can open up opportunities for a more fulfilling life, while being constrained by the thoughts and opinions of others can lead to dissatisfaction or clashed values.. 
Self-reliance can be a powerful tool for success in life. Being able to make informed decisions about your budget and goals for the future can lead to financial stability and a feeling of accomplishment. Making your own decisions based on your personal values and goals can give you a sense of pride and accomplishment, while relying on the guidance of authorities or experts can foster feelings of helplessness or inadequacy. On the other hand, blindly following advice from experts may not always lead to desired outcomes, and can leave you feeling disempowered and frustrated. 

For example, taking control of your finances can be one area in which self-reliance leads to greater sense of achievements",1
"Students may find this approach more stimulating and exciting than a traditional education, leading to better engagement and improved academic achievement. 

Allowing students to be responsible for their own education is a complex idea with potential benefits and drawbacks. Educators must consider the type of structure and resources required to provide appropriate support and guidance for self-directed students, while not stifling their creativity and enthusiasm for learning.. Throughout history, educators have sought to equip students with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to take part in society. 

On one hand, such a system could allow students to take greater control of their own learning experience, diversify their curriculum to more accurately match their individual interests, and encourage them to develop self-discipline as they manage their own progress. They may end up focusing solely on topics that interest them, leaving gaps in their knowledge. The idea of allowing students to be responsible for their own education with minimal oversight by teachers is an intriguing concept to explore. 
Learning is an essential part of growing up. In addition, self-directed learning can be difficult to sustain, and lack of structure and accountability could demotivate students and lead to less successful outcomes. 

On the other hand, without appropriate oversight, students may lack guidance and support when they encounter difficult topics or have difficulty learning independently",1

Recent research shows that students who get involved in extracurricular activities like sports, music, or art can show an improved academic performance in school. This helps children learn better in class and improves their concentration. Studies have also proven that students who participate in activities after school show better social and emotional wellbeing. The positive long-term effects of extracurricular activities include increased self-confidence, better time management skills, improved discipline, and a better understanding of how important working together as a team is.  All of these benefits can not only help students succeed now but also benefit them in the future.. Furthermore, participating in sports helps children maintain a healthy lifestyle and build up a stronger immune system. 

Physical activities, such as sports, have the added benefit of increasing physical strength and endurance. This is because extracurricular activities give children a place to meet and bond with other children outside of the regular school environment which helps in developing a better understanding of how to interact with peers and handle social situations. 

Parents should be interested in their children's extra-curricular activities as they provide a chance for them to grow and make a positive difference in their lives",1
"The biggest accomplishment only are caused when you do things for yourself. But you need have the capacity to show them, that you can and not need help for obtain it.

Accomplishment is the quality or ability, the result of something. Individuality

I am agree to be independent in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because you can feel proud of yourself. Make big accomplishment for yourself, teach you that you can do all that you want, but only if you believe and have trust in you. I think that when you decide make the things for yourself is because you are ready to confront the different situations that the life give you.

The individuality is one that pursues a markedly independent course in thought or action. But when you take the decisions of do, you see that is possible. For example, sometimes many opportunities came for your life, and you never accept. Sometimes we don't something that we want for fear, because think that the result not going to be favorable or how you thoughts. I think that good thoughts can make you successful. Now know that you are able to do anything that you want.

In my conclusion be yourself in the world is good, because your learn about the life, also to do things that you not believe possible. For example, when someone tell you do this, you need to think about it, and decide it is good or not , if is something bad that going to affect you. That is why I think that be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.. This going to make you happy because just you know how you worked for buy it.

Be yourself in the world is not simple, need to have good thoughts, these are the key for the most big accomplishment. Also I think that do all individuality is not easy, but not impossible. That means that your actions have influence in you, all that you doing have a purpose.

For example, when you want something but is spend, you work hard for it, and can get it. Some people no want that you win or protrude in the life, or not believe that you can do. Independent means that you have the control of the you doing, also signify not looking to others for one's opinions or for guidance in conduct",0
"For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. Most of time people doubt others. One should never allow someone to change you.

To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesn't impressed you. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. You don't have to listen to what other people say and tell you. I agree with this statement. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something.

Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.

However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment.        . Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire.

Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life",0
"To have a successful life, it is necessary to eliminate the fear of trying something new and challenge yourself to go out of your comfort zone. Failure is inevitable, but it can also be a learning experience that will help you"", although such lessons may be hard to learn. For each smaller goal, I plan to dedicate the time and effort necessary to achieve it. To accomplish such goals, I have outlined a process of setting small, achievable goals that will eventually lead to the larger goal. Knowing that the outcome is not guaranteed, I am keeping an open mind and reminding myself that nothing is impossible given the right amount of perseverance and hard work.

Just as important as it is to push yourself and challenge yourself, it is also important to realize that failure is a part of life. Doing this will allow you to explore new things, gain wisdom, and experience a sense of personal accomplishment.. 

The difference between people who limit themselves and those who aim for the stars is the willingness to take chances and face the fear of the unknown. This quote contains a powerful message that we can all strive to achieve anything we set our minds to, no matter how daunting the task. Instead of getting stuck in the fear of the unknown, it is important to take risks and try something new. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson, an iconic philosopher, once said: ""Do not go where the path may lead, Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail"". 

Recently, I have researched new things I want to try, such as learning a foreign language, writing a novel, or traveling to a new country",1
"I really think this program would be successful to all the student.. This program would be a great one it would there student a lot. It would help the class communicate to one another. I also think they would be focus all the time. The student would get along easily if they work together. Also the older student are more responsible there also likely to be more trust worthy. I think older student should assist the younger students i think they would get a lot of work done. The program would be a success because student helping one another is great seeing them work together as a class having a good time with there class mates. They would help the younger student a lot i feel like they would learn more.

Then in a few years later the younger student would come the older student and from there they help them as well too. I would also like to be in this program it seems like you would know so many things. Do you think older student should assist younger student? i agree i think it would be a fantastic idea. I feel like older student would help the younger student improve there thinking by getting help from the older students.

I feel like the younger student would not be afraid to ask the older students for help",0
"Additionally, it could provide a unique opportunity for field trips or use the day for special programming. For one, having an extended weekend can help to reduce stress levels from the daily pressures of work and life. 
Taking a four-day weekend can have a positive impact on both mental and physical health. Additionally, employers might be able to save on operational costs if the business is closed for the additional day. For schools, it could grant students an additional day to get organized, study, or attend tutoring. 

In conclusion, taking a four-day weekend can be beneficial for overall mental and physical health, schools, the environment, employers, and employees. Employers and employees could also benefit from having the extra day to rest and recoup. Moreover, having the extra day can allow us to engage in activities we don’t otherwise have time for such as socializing with family and friends, taking the time to relax, or doing something for self-care. 

Furthermore, having a four-day weekend can have many benefits for schools, the environment, employers, and employees. Researchers have found that taking a break, even for a few days, can help to refuel and refresh the mind and body. . This can help to restore a feeling of calm and balance which can be beneficial for physical health. For the environment, having an extra day off could reduce fossil fuel emissions and lead to a cleaner environment",1
"In summary, schools should strive to maintain a cafeteria menu that focuses on providing a variety of nutritious and delicious meal options for students, and a transition from a junk food menu to a healthier one is an excellent way to start.. Moreover, real-life examples demonstrate the positive outcomes of transitioning to a healthier cafeteria menu, such as reduced rates of obesity and greater physical fitness among students. 
The implementation of a healthier cafeteria menu could be hugely beneficial for students. Not only that, having access to a balanced and nutritious school lunch could lead to improved academic performance due to the increased energy and mental focus associated with a healthier diet. Eating right is a fundamental part of staying healthy, and by having better options in the cafeteria, students can make better food choices that align with their physical and mental well-being",1
"Being yourself doesn't depends in how people see you, it depends on you because you are the only one that can choose to change or not, it makes no difference if you did something right or wrong the society always will discriminate and see that at the way they think it is,and you can't do anything about it, you are doing the things that you feel that are correct and how is the way how is has to be, however being in a world that is trying to make you something else is a great accomplishment because there is not way people make you change;

you had to live your life at the way you want it, you have the opportunity to express your feelings everywhere, and you are in the world to be happy and not to satisfy every single person

Sometimes it's hard for you to be deal in the society with opinions that hurt you and make you feel bad about it, and that is something that you cannot change, but it is something that help you to learn how to be more responsible when you are growing up and to be overconfident about what are your thoughts, you have to know that in the world are many people want to see you go down and change the way you are, in that situation you have to be with your head up and be who you really want to be, you can do the difference in your life, but not in others person life

In addition, you have to be proud and brave everywhere you go to because you have the opportunity to express what are yours feelings, there is not way that somebody can change what is in you heart, only you choose who can hurt you and if you want that continue, try to stay positive all the time not matter what is going on in your life, do not let someone know what are your debilities and how you feel about things go in on in your life that person can hurt you every time he/she want it, do the things that make you feel better with yourself

Finally, be happy all the time with the things that you have because it might be the little things, but are things for which you work really hard to have it, you have to be brave especially when you have done something that probably other person will see that bad, however that doesn't mean you are wrong is just what they think about it, you need to be how you feel comfortable and not to maintain happy the society, reach your goals how you want it, don't let anyone destroy your dreams because if that happen you are not going to be cheerful about it

In conclusion, live your life how you want it because is only one, do what you think is correct and follow your dreams, since the moment you let the time past by doing what other people want; you will not be happy nor proud about what you really want to achieve, it's difficult to trust people that one day made you feel safe and in peace and then did things that they knew that it hurt you; if you really want something good for somebody else you will do everything to protect that person and make it feel unique, simply be yourself without get involved in other person's life.

Adding one and a half extra hours to the school day for students could have a vast range of consequences, both positive and negative. It could also discourage them from joining extracurricular activities by reducing the amount of time they have available to participate. On the positive side, students may have more opportunities to engage with their coursework in-depth and get more out of their educational experience. Ultimately, the potential consequences of adding one and a half extra hours to the school day for students are far-reaching and should be carefully considered.. On the negative side, it could increase the amount of stress students face and lead to higher levels of fatigue and burnout. It could also give them more time to participate in extracurricular activities and develop new skills. Furthermore, it may create additional financial burdens as students would need to pay for childcare for any siblings they may have",1
"An extra two hours of school would take time away from other personal pursuits and could limit the amount of time that students have for things such as sports, music, and community service. 

Ultimately, while extending the school day could bring about various positive changes, a careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks should be conducted in order to determine if the extended day would be a viable option for Generic_School. On the plus side, an added two hours could improve student attendance by providing a more structured schedule and giving students a purpose while outside of school. In my opinion, given the potential for improved student attendance, responsibility, and school culture, the pros outweigh the cons of implementing a longer school day.. 
Extending the school day at Generic_School by two hours for four days a week has the potential to bring many advantages as well as some drawbacks. Increased responsibility could also be a result of extending the school day; with more time spent in the classroom, students would be better agitated to perform their best and follow the rules.

On the other hand, something that must be considered when making this decision is the trade-off between school and extracurricular activities",1
"I think that having a very formal manger and attitude in life will get you a long ways in life then being grumpy and mean toward other people. Meaning they might would like to share with you on how they found the key to success. A lot of people think that positive attitude is the key to success in life. That's why there is a saying teat people the way you want to be treated. I didn't know that having all this kindness and positive energy could reflect on who i am today. The only reason I say this is,because I was one of those students that didn't interact with anyone because of my attitude. After that you would probably would like to share the key to your success, and how it helped you accomplish your goals that you might have thought that you never would.

Thirdly, this may lead you to the success in life that you have been dreaming about. Therefor you will get the same amount of respect that you put out there toward other people

Firstly, I do believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. I think that having positive attitude in life is the key to success, and you might ask your why. That being millionaire or stepping up in your woke place etc. Now that I have learn and taught my self to be the person who I am today I have made so many friends that I didn't know I would talk. Being joyful and happy in life will allow you to accomplish and allow you to work 100 percent good.

Lastly, all I have to say is that positive attitude is the key to success in life. Having good positive energy will allow you to meet new people and they might want to interact with you for having good energy surrounding.

Secondly, this may allow you to meet new people. That why I say have good strong positive energy and you will get a lot back in life        . Having all this positively and good energy will get you along way in life. Why you might ask your self",0
"Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Personally, I would rather go to my house, and eat spaghetti because people need to realize of what career they would want to choose if they would want to succeed in the future. Impression isn't for everybody, nor it is for some students who need of help finding a career in high school or college. Support is a main key to success; however, few of my friends disagree with me. The reason why I like support, for I wouldn't want to brainstorm careers by myself.

The thing about young people is that thinking about careers in high school should have more time to think, for it is always important of what career they would want to choose. The reason why they don't believe in support, for they found careers easier without receiving help in college, or even in high school. I do agree that some students should brainstorm about their careers in high school; however, I am not very sure if they would like to learn a lot about whatever career they have committed to. Impression would help some students in high school, but some teachers do think it would also help them in college. Some teachers think it is a better idea to think of a career in high school, yet some students disagree with the teachers. Generic_Name wanted to become a doctor, yet she didn't do well, so she gotten support to look for another career in college. The reason why I choose this topic, for people need time, impression, and support for their careers.

People always need time to think of what career that they would want to choose, so they can enjoy their careers, and have better reputation in their work. These are all the reasons why I think we should have time, impression, and support. Students in high school need to understand that if they don't like the career that they choose, they are more likely to fail than succeeding than others in their careers. Some students think having impression won't help you, yet some students do agree that having impression would help pressure them to find a career. Bunch of students agree that having to think about career in high school is a good thing; however, a lot of students disagree that we should have more time to think about careers at a older age. Careers are like longtime thinking, for people would want to change their minds, and choose another career that is more suitable for them to learn in college. Even people do want to commit to a career at a young age they would still need to know what to do to learn in college. Few of my friends want to become a doctor, and some of my other friends would want to become a mechanic. Generic_Name went to college with impression, so she had the confidence of choosing what career that she would like to choose at a older age. People also need to support young kids that having a career is a longtime changing, so they would have to think about it in college, and not in high school. We should commit to a career at a older age, not at a younger age.. Personally, I would need impression if I would wanna go to college.

Support is also good too, for people who aren't confident of choosing what career they want to learn about, so they would ask their friends, or even family members for help and support. These are the reasons why I think young people should have more time to think of what career that they would want to have, so they can gain more confidence in the future.

Impression is also important, for it helps people gain morale if they would want to think of a career. Thinking about a career isn't easy, yet some students don't take it seriously of what career that they are committed to",0

Humans are by nature inquisitive and independent, and the ability to make their own decisions is essential to growth and development. This is how we truly start to take control of our lives and reach our potential as self-fulfilled, independent individuals. Additionally, our own decisions allow us to understand how we are in control of our own destiny and to learn the importance of taking responsibility for what we do. 

Decision-making also requires us to weigh the consequences of different options in order to choose the one that is most advantageous. When we make our own decisions, we become responsible for their consequences, both positive and negative, and the lessons that we can learn from them remain with us. Ultimately, the power of taking our own decisions gives us a greater sense of confidence, strength, and individualism, and is essential for becoming mentally and emotionally healthy as well as achieving our personal goals.. 

By embracing autonomy, complexity, and responsibility, we become better able to use our own judgment and creativity to solve challenges, identify goals, and set achievable objectives. This helps foster logical and rational thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to make objective decisions, which are all important steps for personal growth. Making one's own decisions is key to developing a sense of self-efficacy and internal locus of control",1

Let's be honest if you're yourself and not faking who you are in this world you'll become a better person in this world. One thing you don't ever forget is to be honest,and to be real with yourself and everyone around you.

Girls,if you reading this please don't make the same mistakes that i did in my past be always honest with your partnership or whoever, because the consequences are not how you might think. after 5 months of going to therapy,i was able to talk him to close a chapter because i learn to forgive but in my heart i felt hate for him what i told him was ""i love you but i love other person more than you and that person i'ts me"" yes, he cried but he did not deserved me .Finally i let toxic people leave my life,i'm not going to lie like i'm afraid to talk a guy again because i feel they will hurt me.

Girls,find a guy who is real with you all the time they might be a lot of guys out there that can pretend that he is in love with you",0
"How or why, so you should all ways learn your lesson that, why or how did failure In your success life and happiness never let anything come between you, because you will get stronger each time and better.. On the other hand, failure Is good because they know how strong and powerful thy are and nothing can break you or failure you.

Being powerful and strong Is so Important so that life will change you no matter. However If you did something learn you mistake lesson to not do It again and forget the mistake.

However, It's not good to have failure some people can't handle It so they kill them self. For example, my mom would tell me life Is a lesson each day you will learn something different and you will get stronger so you don't know when and what will happen to you so mantle and physically be strong. Although even If you have a good life don't think that's It that you will not have any problems anymore. Failure Is Success

Nothing can make you stronger then failure. If you don't work hard and not be strong failure can make your life so harder

On the other hand, life is a lesson and challenge for everyone It can take a risk so you need to be strong for what ever come to you and be powerful for not any failures so to you and break you. It make's you more success In life, even helps you to learn a life lesson, that you can do much more then what you could image to build your life and happens.

"Elementary school students are typically unaware of the concept of a long-term job and tend to approach career choices from a more whimsical perspective. However, this belief fails to acknowledge the reality of the modern world in which teenagers can commit to long-term goals earlier on. Moreover, due to their age, there are limits to the degree of responsibility they can take on. Ultimately, committing to a career at a young age requires the willingness to learn and the patience to maneuver through an ever-changing landscape.. This age group may also begin to explore the creation of a resume and the development of professional skills. Young people can demonstrate the breadth of their experience and knowledge which shows that not all adolescents are the same.

Even with the ambition and drive to pursue a career, teenagers still face unique challenges. On the other hand, middle school students start to recognize the consequences of their decisions and may begin to commit to a career path. 

Unfortunately, many adults may view teenagers as too inexperienced or immature to decide on a career. 
As students begin to develop a sense of individual identity, the career paths they pursue change drastically. They may not have the educational background or internships necessary to enter professional fields",1
"The small shops, bustling markets, and colorful architecture all make the city seem alive and full of life.

They are a diverse group that respects all kinds of cultures and backgrounds, making it an extremely open-minded area to visit",1
"This way, one can ensure that their decision is well informed and considered.. Other people, such as family and friends, can provide a valuable source of input, which can help give clarity to one's own ideas and provide insight into the perspectives of other people. 

It is important to consider the importance of trusting your own decision, rather than always relying on expert advice or the opinion of authorities. Ignoring your intuition and making the wrong decision can have dire consequences, ranging from missed opportunities to poor physical or mental health. Listening to professionals can provide helpful information, but one must always exercise their own judgment and be aware of their own feelings and thoughts. When making decisions, it is important to weigh up both one's own opinion against that of family and other sources, in order to make the best decision. Above all, it is essential to take one's time and thoroughly consider the decision twice before taking any action",1
"Furthermore, it can be difficult to return to the person they once were due to societal pressures, fear of what others may think, or simply a lack of the same spirit that led them to make the change in the first place. 
Being yourself means embracing the qualities that make you the individual that you are. It challenges the very cohesive idea of an unchanging “original you” as one may have different personalities in different settings, contexts, or times in life.. 

Overall, changing who you are involves taking a risk and reflects how someone adapts to their dynamic environment. Throughout history, there have been many examples of people seeking to be someone they are not. 

On the one hand, a person may be able to reinvent themselves for the better, freeing themselves of the trappings of the past and emerging anew, unburdened by whatever shackles them. Whether it be to hide their true identities from an oppressive government, to fit in with a different social circle, or to simply chase a different version of themselves, this kind of transformation can have both positive and negative effects. But on the other, they may be forced to change themselves in undesirable ways, potentially becoming cowardly in their attempt to fit in with their new environment. It is the process of being confident in who you are and living your life honestly and authentically",1

"Enjoyable activity is a good thing when it comes to being yourself and having fun. They can also, use sports to prove to there parents that they are worthy. Some examples can be, when your trying to explain yourself to somebody, you can do that by using music. Such as, find a song that you think tells people of you the most and tell them if you want to get to know me listen to this song.

In closing, enjoyable activities can be fun and hard sometimes but u have to stick with it and pass through that. Enjoyable activities can be sports and ban.

Sports is enjoyable activity because athletes use sports as a excuses to get good grades, so they wont have to tell there friends that they are really smart. Such as, going out on the court or the field, just being yourself, and acting a fool.

 Graduating from high school and college are important steps for achieving career goals and financial success in life. Finally, assisting immigrant shelters by donating, volunteering, fundraise, and educating the public on the importance of providing aid and help for those in need is a great way to show compassion and help refugees in need.. To help parents, creating a budget and sticking to it, offering to help them with expenses, and engaging in thoughtful conversations about their plans for the future can all show support.

"example for students to like the idea of identify, is to prepare them college and some may not go to college and start working.

Inclusion students should chose a career the like and love. Also help them to a great future and everything is possible, however, I think that is a good idea for students to commit to a career a young age and to also help them became better person and make good chooses. I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. That what make some students dropping out of high school, because they think they are not smart enough or some students cant afford to pay for some school supply.

I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Some student don have that kind of privilege as some students have to all subject so they can graduate from high school to go to college. It can also impacted students to finish their goals and became better person in the future. They can also be success on what ever they can achieve in life.

for example when i start the school i was so positive but same time negative because i dont know anyone, the language also but always you have one reason to do something and i have one reason thats my son, i was positive about what i want and what are my goals,the time past very fast; i found people important in my life, my friends they always are positive and this help yourself. When i talk with my friends i feel positive also because they make me feel like that, so now it's my last year and i feel good and this is the point to make up my dreams and goals.

Never give up everything depends on your decisions, if you are negative or not believe in yourself you never to be able for your goals or other things like work, school and support other people it's important be positive, no matter what the other people say, no matter how many times you try, the key is achieve and think about your future.

"Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Basically my option is no, it is not a good idea to graduate early.. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn:

How to save up money for a better future

How to have a better behavior

You learn how to spell some stuff correctly

How to write essays

There is a lot that you must know before graduating. - Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years?

In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover",0
"Additionally, students in after school activities often benefit from close relationships with mentors and coaches and have the potential to be part of a team. For instance, students may be exposed to activities that are not consistent with school values and beliefs, and the amount of time devoted to such activities may interfere with the student’s ability to complete their homework in a timely manner. However, after school activities can also have disadvantages. On the positive side, a student is able to work independently and in a familiar environment, where they may feel more comfortable and secure. Additionally, the lack of peer interactions and motivation in an unstructured setting can lead to a student becoming easily distracted.. 

Doing homework at home has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
After school activities offer advantages such as providing an engaging environment with a sense of camaraderie, fostering the development of important social skills, and enhancing physical health. On the other hand, it can be hard to remain focused and stay on task without the structure and support of an after school program",1
"In addition, online classes can be better targeted to accommodate students with learning disabilities, since they can customize the pace at which they complete the required work. For those with busy schedules, online classes provide greater flexibility. These are just some of the ways that online classes can be of benefit to students. Students can enjoy greater flexibility in their academic schedules, the opportunity to work from the comfort of their own home, more targeted learning experiences, and a rich global experience. 

In conclusion, online classes offer a variety of advantages for students with work and family responsibilities, as well as those who are ill or disabled. Another advantage of online classes is that they offer the opportunity to interact with classmates from around the world and can offer a rich cultural experience. Furthermore, for those who may be too ill to attend class in person, or those with mobility or other physical disabilities, online classes allow them to pursue their educational goals from the comfort of their own home. 
Online classes offer many advantages for students with work, family, illness or disability. Students can accommodate their work and family obligations more easily by scheduling their classes around those obligations",1

"In addition, the use of technology in waste free living has been explored as an option for reducing environmental impact, such as through the development of sustainable products and services. With the advent of the internet, access to instant information has revolutionized how we obtain knowledge. For example, technology can be used to better manage natural resources, like water or energy usage, in order to conserve them. The potential benefits of technology are numerous, including improved communication, enhanced efficiency, increased access to information, and the ability to increase productivity. 

The evolution of technology has been remarkable over the past decades. 
In the modern world, technology is ubiquitous. However, there are also health risks associated with the misuse of technology, such as sleep deprivation, obesity, and musculoskeletal problems from too much sitting. We rely on it for almost everything - from communication to entertainment to running businesses. Despite these impressive advancements, the effects of overreliance on technology are still being examined. In addition, advances in artificial intelligence have enabled machines to take on tasks that were traditionally done by humans, such as data analysis and machine learning. It has been suggested that excessive use of technology can create a rift in social life, replacing face-to-face contact with virtual connections.

In some cases, humans have adapted to use technology in a creative way to survive and flourish. 

Ultimately, it is up to humans to consider the impact of overreliance on technology, and decide for themselves if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.",1
"In the end, she felt confused and frustrated, and failed to take any decisive action. For example, a friend of mine was considering switching career paths, but was overwhelmed with the multitude of opposing views from people in her life. Ultimately, I decided to follow my heart and take the leap; that has been one of the best decisions I have ever made, as it provided me with invaluable experiences and personal growth. This is an example of the potential benefits of listening to multiple sources of input. 

However, it is also important to recognize that there can be adverse outcomes of absorbing advice from too many people. We must strive to seek out the opinions of those closest to us as well as respected mentors, and be cognizant of when to trust our own judgment and take decisive action.. 
It is undeniable that hearing different pieces of advice from many different people can have a profound effect on our lives. While some people cautioned me about the risks of taking such a break, others advised me to trust my instinct and go for it. In my own life, I've experienced the positive and negative consequences of taking in input from many diverse sources. This illustrates how too many voices can paralyze an individual and cause them to become stuck in a state of indecision. 

In conclusion, it is essential to bear in mind that listening to multiple pieces of advice from various people can be beneficial, but there is an inherent danger of feeling overwhelmed and stuck with too many opposing views. When I was considering taking a gap year prior to college, I sought out advice from many people, ranging from family and friends to teachers and mentors",1
"If we are authentic and embody our true selves, we will feel more content and more comfortable in our own skin. In the end, the caterpillar realized that beauty came from within, and it became happy with its true nature.

The moral of the story is the importance of being yourself and not trying to be something that you are not. In the end, it is better to be proud of who you are, than to pretend to be somebody else.

Therefore, it is important to always be true to yourself. I thought it would make me popular and likeable. Remember, always be true to you.. I tried to mimic the girls that were popular in my class, thinking that if I act like them I would be accepted. Life will be a lot more enjoyable and fulfilling when you embrace who you are. 
Growing up, I was convinced that if I changed my hair, my clothes or my accent, then I would be cool. I remember going to a new school and desperately trying to fit in. He told me the story of a caterpillar who wanted to be a different color, so it kept trying to change its spots. People like us for who we are, not for who we pretend to be. A friend of mine shared a story with me that resonated with how I was feeling. It is not easy, but it is necessary to be yourself and be comfortable in who you are. After months of trying to change myself, I realized that it only made me feel worse about myself.

I had stopped being true to myself and it had made me feel like a phony. Do not try to force yourself into being someone that you are not",1
"m and it would be better to stay inside in those hours than to go outside and for example a teenager is walking home from a friends house late in the midnight and gets in a fight with gang member and gets shot. I think curfews do keep teenagers out of trouble and it helps them sleep on time because after those hours a lot of law breaker are on the streets and something bad could be happening outside or on the streets like gang fights , shootings , robbers , durg dealers, drunk drivers and many more. The first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after 10 p. And another example a teenager has a game he does not sleep early and he wakes up tried and is not able to play the game as well as he could.

Curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropritely and how they spend the day for example a teenagers has a project or a home work the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep.

In conclusion adopting the curfew idea would be good because it will keep the teenagers out of trouble and help them mange their time appropritely.. while it would have been better with the curfew in place.

Curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day",0
"nI really loved that activity because you learn more and become good at it.

Another activity that can be fun and cool and enjoyable is playing an insturment. you get to even become a professional player

I played soccer for about two years and now i am good at it. Last year me and my friends went to Generic_City. Before in elemantary school i used to be bad at it and used to say ""im bad at this"" or ill say ""im not good at it"" but then i entered in a summer soccer program every evening or in the day i would go to a school and we would go to a soccer field. so i recommend you to go look for an activity that fits yoou right and that enjoyable and educational.. i cant wait to do it this year we will be doing chemisry in april. it was fun. They can be fun because you get to do alot of things with them. And the fun part is that you get to be in a stage with your friends and play music infront of the audiance.

Another enjoyable activity is chemistry its fun because you get to mix different chemicals to objects or chemical to chemical. Mixing chemicals can be hard and scary because what happens if you mix the chemcals and something happens in chemistry you have to be very careful with what chemicals are you mixing together.

I am very happy because you have thosands or hundres of activitys to choose from because their are alot of people who are loking for a good and fun activity. In this new year that we are now there are thosands of enjoyable and educational activitys. Me and my science class will be doing it this year i am happy to do it becaue i never mixed chemicals or never put on science goggles. These activitys should be done because they are very fun.

An activity can be fun is like playing a sport their are alot of sports out there that can be fun and aggresive but its exciting to play a sport because you get to go on trips and you get to verse other teams or with only one player. It is fun because i used to play an insturment the last three years and it was fun because you get to go to trips. We went with the orchestra class, band, and even chores. and its nice to play an insrument because you have alot of oppsions to choose from and you even get to play nice soothing music or loud and extreame",0
"Without imagination, knowledge alone cannot be leveraged effectively to manifest the desired dreams and ambitions.. Through his imagination he was driven to build the electric car company Tesla and SpaceX. 
Imagination can be an incredibly powerful tool for achieving success. Imagination allows us to dream, devise plans, and think outside the box. It's essential to understand the science behind what we are creating, but without creative ideas to guide us, all the knowledge in the world is useless.

In summary, imagination is just as important as knowledge when it comes to achieving success. It gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new, explore uncharted territory, and extend the boundaries of what is possible. Knowledge without creativity and imagination is like driving a car without a destination. It enables us to go beyond our known boundaries and explore possibilities that we had not considered before. His successful vision was made possible by his ingenious imagination rather than sheer knowledge.

On the other hand, knowledge is important in the process of achieving success, however, without imagination, it is unlikely that this knowledge can be leveraged effectively. In short, it gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new and make it happen.

Take the example of Elon Musk, who envisioned a world in which electric cars become the norm and space exploration was feasible for everyone",1
"With the right supplies and the right routines, biking can offer a wonderful exclamation on the summer season.. Whether you are interested in sightseeing, shopping, or trying local cuisine, bike riding can offer an enjoyable experience.

To make biking even more enjoyable, there are a few things to keep in mind. Additionally, check the weather before leaving and make sure to bring the necessary protective clothing and sunscreen. However, there are many places to bike that provide a variety of activities, while still taking advantage of the warm weather - from exploring the wide open countryside to discovering tourist attractions.

When it comes to activities to do while biking, there are countless possibilities. 

Biking during the summer is an excellent way to enjoy the outdoors and take advantage of the warm weather. With so many different places to bike, it can be difficult to decide where to explore. Exploring new places around town or simply taking a leisurely ride to spend time with friends and family can provide an excellent way to make the most of summertime. 
Biking during the summer can be a fun and enjoyable activity for both novice and experienced riders. Bringing along food, drinks, and snacks is essential for keeping energy levels up on long rides; it can also be useful to bring along friends and family to enjoy the experience together. Biking can be a great way to get to a variety of places quickly and enjoy the scenery along the way",1
"I strongly believe this would be beneficial to our students and our school.. 

Updating the policy to allow students a chance to join no matter what their skill level is, would open up a larger range of students to join teams. Moreover, providing an opportunity to learn and develop skills in the sport for those with less experience would ensure that everyone has a chance to be part of the team. While we have many sports teams at our school available to students, a policy change is urgently needed to make sure that everyone has a chance to join. 

Currently, the criteria for joining teams is restricted to highly experienced students who often have had the chance to receive extra and expensive after-school training to become proficient in the sport. This puts many students at a disadvantage as they cannot participate on the team if they cannot meet the physical and technical requirements. 

With so many potential benefits for the whole school, I respectfully request that policy changes be made to provide students the chance to join sports teams regardless of their experience level. Additionally, students who join teams often have improved mental health, better relationships with peers, and increased motivation in academic studies. 
As the principal of our school, I'm sure you want to give students the best opportunities to build a positive environment both physically and mentally. 

A change in policy would also support the inclusion of students from backgrounds who may have never considered participating in sports. Increasing opportunities for students in this way can contribute to an overall more positive school climate where everyone can feel included",1
"We should not let people choose how they want our character to be. Since I want them to like me I will end up changing my personality and look just so that they can like me; this makes my character be influenced by others.

I urge you to think about your character if it's formed by the way you choose or if it is formed by who you surround yourself with. Since society has made it seem that if you don't look like Kylie Jenner or any other famous person that you're not pretty and because, of that people want to change their character.

Finally, our character is formed by who we are around is because we want people to like us. I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.. For example, if my friends are always skipping school and they ask me to skip school with them and I am going to say yes since, they are my friends. For example, if I am at school and I want to be friends with a group of girls I will do what they like and do what they do all the time so, that they can like me. For example, on social media there is a lot of models, and singers. Social media plays a big part on how our character is formed. What most do us do is ,that we can not say no to our friends and by saying yes, it makes up our character because now people see us as a person who skips school.

Another reason on why our character is influenced by other people is, because of social media. A lot of young teens want to be like them so they will change the way the look and act. Have you ever wonder how our character is formed? John Lubbock once wrote, "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.

Many people believe that we choose our own character by being ourself and not caring what anyone thinks however, I think that our character is formed by our friends since were always with them",0

That being said, it is important to be mindful of the limits of advice-taking. Research has found that advice can increase an individual's overall ability to make smart decisions by providing external perspective on their situation and identifying potential pitfalls or problematic behavior. Therefore, it's vital to use advice as a tool to inform the decision-making process, rather than relying on it completely. In school, having a trusted mentor or peer to turn to can make it easier to identify the best path forward in the face of any given situation. In addition, having a reliable opinion can also build self-confidence within decision-making scenarios, as it provides reassurance that the chosen path is a considered one. Ultimately, by being thoughtful and discerning with the advice-taking process, individuals can make better decisions and be rewarded for it.. It’s also important to have a source of advice that is engaging and supportive, to ensure that it is a helpful aid when making decisions. 
Advice can be invaluable for helping individuals make informed decisions. Advice-givers don’t necessarily understand the intricacies of an individual’s situation, and, in some cases, may put their own feelings or judgments ahead of others’ feelings or best interests",1
"Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career and my position on this issue is properly to not makes that they aren't allowed to indentify a career at a young age from selected to guide them toward a specific career because for all of those who has a career and is because their are worked hard to arrive from they are and they get to propose.

Currently they can't have a commit to a career at young age, because for that has to be prepared and work hard nobody can has a commit to a career at young age.

for that you need to finish high school and college and work for the career you want.

It's about believing in yourself and finding the strength to overcome challenges when times get tough. With a little effort and a lot of positivity, you can conquer anything!. This type of attitude can encourage you to keep going and eventually lead to success.

"With the invention of text messaging, video calls, and social networks, it is now easier than ever for people to remain in contact with those they love from wherever they may be. On one hand, it has allowed people to connect with one another across greater distances and in new ways. It has enabled us to stay connected in new and exciting ways, while at the same time leading some of us to bypass the importance of physical contact. On the other hand, technology has also had a significant impact on the amount of physical contact that people have with each other. With so many different methods of communication available, many of which are digital, it can be easy to forgo face-to-face contact with family and friends. 

In conclusion, it is clear that technology has both positive and negative effects on human contact. 
Technology has revolutionized the way people interact and communicate with each other. This lack of physical contact can have a detrimental effect on our emotional wellbeing and can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. To make the most out of modern technology, it is essential that we place a premium on physical communication as well, so that our emotional connections with others can be strengthened.",1
"Furthermore, it requires students to be self-motivated and have good time-management skills in order to successfully complete their work. On one hand, public school provides students the opportunity to experience social interactions and peer relationships that will benefit them in the long run. distance learning has been a long standing argument. However, with the current pandemic, distance learning has become a necessity. 
The debate of public school vs. Distance learning can be an excellent option for those who need extra flexibility or convenience but it requires students to be dedicated and motivated in order to succeed.. 

One of the key advantages of distance learning is that it is more convenient and can be schedule to fit a variety of needs. The lack of social interaction can lead to feelings of isolation, while also making it easier to cheat as there isn’t the same level of accountability as there would be in a traditional classroom setting. 

However, it is important to note that distance learning also has its drawbacks. For those considering distance learning, it is important to consider the pros and cons to ensure that it is the right fit for their situation. 

In conclusion, the decision to choose public school or distance learning should be based on individual needs and preferences. Furthermore, it allows students to customize their learning by working independently and taking charge of their own progress. Students can also access materials and resources online that would otherwise be difficult in a traditional setting",1
"Through open communication, understanding, and support, we can help foster a more welcoming and equitable world.. Developing an environment of acceptance can help foster a better sense of self-esteem amongst everyone. Furthermore, providing outlets such as art or sports activities may help create a space where kids can explore their passions without fear of being belittled.

Last but not least, people can have fun without resorting to violence. School professionals, counselors, and parents can provide assistance to those experiencing bullying. Participating in activities that bring joy to people can help reduce stress and create a more accepting environment for all.

Respect for each other is essential when it comes to preventing bullying and creating safe and secure environments where everyone can feel respected. This can help set the tone for healthy communication and positive behavior among peers.

Moreover, it is important to create avenues to provide support and guidance to those affected by bullying. This includes learning trades, volunteering, starting clubs for common interests or taking on enjoyable hobbies. Respectful behavior can be taught at an early age by highlighting the fact that teasing, name-calling, and sarcasm can hurt people's feelings and should be avoided. 
One way to prevent bullying is to promote respect for each other's feelings, bodies, and opinions",1
"Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. . We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient.

To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year.

What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. In addition,

principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year.

First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. Finally, we should give the student an opportunity they will enjoy it and they will not throw it away. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem.

Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days",0
"Being in advanced classes also put pressure on students to keep up with their studies and peers at a more accelerated pace.

In order to battle these issues, it is important for students to be well prepared for college. 
As the challenges of graduating high school in three years become more established, we need to be aware of the potential issues and how we can best address them. Many students who finish high school in a condensed timeframe may struggle with the adjustment to college life. Additionally, for students who are looking for more immediate relief, there are alternative options available, such as taking college classes while still in high school or taking a gap year between high school and college. For those experiencing financial difficulty, seeking financial aid or applying for grants and scholarships is a great way to help cover college expenses. With ample preparation, support, and alternative options, students can still achieve their post-secondary dreams.. Not participating in typically senior years activities such as prom, senior trips, or senior lock-ins can be disappointing for these students. 

Overall, it is important for students graduating high school in a condensed timeframe to be aware of the potential issues they could face, but also possible solutions. They should actively participate in extracurricular activities, and take advantage of on-campus support services such as mental health counselors, academic advisors, and mentors",1
"schools shuold focus on what the student want to be in the future but they can focus to in what are they good for example: they can see if the student if good painting it can be a painter or if the are good in number it can be good in bussines such as banks , cashier and they can improve all this nuolage in the job that the students has as a part-time ,thats what the schools should focus in what the students are good and then make a decition of what can study and what it can be a good collage or univercity for each one .

societies should not expect that students with young age should decide to chose what to study (a carrer) they don't have clare ideas to decide what they want to syudy. students in freshman year cannot decide what they want to study or what collage they want to go ,because their too young to make that important decition even if they make it , when the years passed they are going to study another carrer, anoher one that gives then inspiration

.student should not commit in a carrer with young age,they can make a bad decition, if they have another oportunity to change their decition it can be good but if they can't it can be bad if you get in a carrer that your are not going to improve.

students who enter to HS for the first time they should focus on get classes for example: art, economy, guitar, etc. Another responsability that the student shoud focus is in get credits for dipoma that they want that can be standard or advanced diploma another think they must focus is get good grade for all four years nine, ten, eleven, and the most important 12 but when the student get into the eleven grade they must being thinking about what they want to study, searching for collage and carrers, get imformation about collage and universities that can be good for you.

societies decide student at the young age are expected to decide what collage or univercity they want and what carrer they should be going to chose. when they get a good noulesh ,they can ask than self, its that what they want to study and don't led anyone make a decition for you,think about a carrer that can like you and benefit you in the future something that like you and never is going to get tired of your carrer because you like what you chose for your and you have a pasion on your carrer that why society have to change that expectation that the students have to make a desiton in young age,choosing a carrer is not a game its imortant to contrivuted with the society in life if you choos a carrer that you are not going to improve is going to be dificult cause yo have make a wrong decition

Teachers in higt school shuld provide a good ideas for student talks about, how the collage or the univercity it can be teach them how is the way the collage and univercities work with the students. However, many student that make a decition in young age they can decide but in a few month they are going to chose another carrer because they don't like what they decide or they don't have the noulage, that why youngets students cannot make a important decition until they get in a good noulage.. However, when the students are youngest they cannot decide what they want to study, firts they want be a doctor and the a few years later a police and thats how it goes youngest student can't decide what they want to be until they get to a good age and a good inspiration on a class and that helps them to decide what carrer they want,student should focus on the carrer they want baced in what class are they very good when you are in eleven garde you see that your are good in something, you don't have to chose a carrer that you don't understand or you don't like",0

I think it not a great idea because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves.

Most students should get a long summer break because they have to take their time and review their work and go to summer school for a make up class that would help them to get credits back or graduates the coming years. With this opinion, I think am little bit agree because during the winter the snowy weather kind of disrupt everything or activities that was supposed to happened during the school year. Meanwhile another hands the students does not have to missed a week or weeks to school but a day or two. I think no because they would be giving an excuse about the snowy weather and the real cold weather and schools would be canceling which would affects the process of curriculum on what the class are learning. Imagine have in a break during the summer, would any students have the chances of making up class work during the winter? or would they even think about the ideas of doing a class makeup?. for example if they miss one or two days they would have a day to revised their notes and maybe be prepare for a coming test or quiz in the future, never the ;less they wont have to study for too long for a test or quizzes again.

In conclusion

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. For instance the school would have to take a week off of that summer break so that the teacher would have time to complete what he or she has to teach the students. And I believe that students should always have the opportunity to have a long break especially a long summer break. Therefor students needs a longer summer break to succeed on their goal.

Meanwhile other students need a long summer breaks to spend a long time with their families because they has already spend a long school learn especially the once that had honors class also the students who are in college. Most students who spends some quality time with their family might have a better chance of setting up a goal for the next school year by all means because they are getting a better advice from their family, for example I had a understanding that students who spent the most time with their family discussing their school year would get motivated and has a goal for themselves before the new school year, meanwhile in the winter break, you wont have that much time to spend with your family, because most of your family who live far across would most likely not want to come visit because of the winter. for example during the winter when we sometimes gets a snowy weather we cancel schools and that one day that school get cancel it affects most teachers planing on what they should do for that day. Therefor they should get a long summer break even tho they would gets a week or two off, for instance I believe if they get a a day or two there would be no chances for them to forgets everything they learned during the time school opens to the beginning of winter. Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families .

because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves. Given students a long summer opportunities would give them the chance to take a restful break from all the ethic school year they have being having.

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. For example when during the winter most of my family who lives abroad or out of states would never come to visit us during the winter break because they said it winter and it really cold, while in the summer each and everyone of our family would come to visit because we spend some quality time together and they always give me some good advice on how to be successful on my education and what goal I should set to gain my success.

Finally though other are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families ",0
"Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donal's, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.

Conclusion:

In my conclusion I think that influencing others is not good because it to force many people to do several things wrong. It is the word that convince othes to do somthing.

For example:

Somebody offer you some beer, wine, or drugs that are bad influence. It can describes many things that can be good in your work or in your life. I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. If a friend say to you, hey come on lets stole that bicicle it's a bad influence. It convince many children to go throught bad ways. However, the word influence can be exellent too.                                                      . It has a lot of meanings. It gets othes in wrong ways. Topic:

Influencing others.

Argument:

Influence is a big word. It has a lot of ways to describe.

Position:

Mi position is negative for the word influence",0
"they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. If they can continuing to study in the future they can earn to much money, because in the past it was hard for them, but now is more easily then the first time when they start                             . That's why student do not have time to practice the game. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

Please help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Students failure the game every time when we have a game with another team, because for some reasons they do not beat the game",0
"The multi-faceted approach, which included individuals with different expertise, allowed for all angles to be identified and addressed to ensure the end result was a project that was feasible and beneficial to the Empire. Collaboration typically involved two or more individuals or groups working together to obtain a desired outcome from a project. However, it is also important to understand the information and advice that is being provided before attempting to create a solution. Similarly, in the Islamic Empire, collaboration was seen as an important part of the decision-making process and ideas were welcomed from different stakeholders for input.

Combining different ideas and perspectives when seeking advice or trying to solve a problem is a key advantage of collaboration. By gathering input from multiple people, there is greater potential for a better solution to be identified and for the efficiency of the project to be improved. In both Empires, it was viewed as essential to truly understand the opinion and contributions of all parties involved in order to create a favorable outcome.. 
In both the Roman and Islamic Empires, collaboration was highly valued as a way of pooling resources and perspectives to achieve common goals. The collaborative approach allowed for different perspectives and ideas to be combined to create more effective solutions. 

For example, when creating a new infrastructure project within the Roman Empire, it was not uncommon for a variety of experts to be consulted",1

The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. For example, it is possible that student performance could improve if they are given extra time to focus on studies or better understand the material. Furthermore, local school districts could be faced with strain due to the heightened burden of providing teachers, resources, and updating curriculum to accommodate the addition. In conclusion, the implications of adding extra time to the school day should be carefully considered before any additional hours are added.. Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours",1
"Those are my reasons to do a perform community and, I will like your school to participate with us on having a clean area to live in.

Thank you. Dear Principal,

The reason why I'm writing you this letter is because, I would like your students and all your school to help us to do a perform community service.

All the schools are planning to do one in their community because the state weather its not so good in the communities, because of the contamination of the fabrics and cars, its better for the students and teachers to do a community service because that way we can have a better life without contamination and another way that helps is that we can have a better health",0
"If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home.

Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. He was smart,just too lazy to study. They think it's much safer for students to take an online class at home. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. And his parents were happy to see that because it's difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. We didn't see him for a long time even the class was over. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment.

One reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. It's undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade.

Another reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldn't attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. I can't say if it's a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasn't like to talk.

In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldn't attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. His parents told us he won't come to school anymore because he hated school. Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didn't pay attention. . If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. Although he wasn't like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home ",0

also if we had only two hours school we are with energy is more essay.

"In order to become more self-reliant, individuals can focus on learning new skills, developing budgeting habits, and becoming more independent. Being self-reliant means having the ability to become self-sufficient and providing for one's own needs without relying on others. Many famous people have used self-reliance to become successful, such as Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk. Not putting an importance on self-reliance can have unfavorable consequences such as wasting money, engaging in poor behavior, and general feelings of helplessness. 
Self-reliance is an important concept that helps define success. Fortunately, investing in self-reliance can have positive results, such as developing confidence and skills that attract success and opportunities in life.",1
"You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. Hate on you, but don't let that slow you down! keep doing, and achieving and great things will come down to your way. You are taking your chances, and not blowing it. Start now, and don't let stuff handed to you. You will be great, and you'll thank yourself in the future.

My third reason, and final reason is you get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people. For example: doing your homework, and stop procrastinating on the stuff you need to do, or want to do, doing tasks when you don't feel like it. They would like a person that is quite different, and not the same as everybody else you know. They would want to hang with someone that is quite active, respectful, and successful.

My conclusion: Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. You are ready to grab life by it's neck, and just yank it, cause it's yours. You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. For example:There is a saying that If someone is hating on you, then you're doing something great, if they're not hating on you, then you're not doing anything really.

My second reason is that you're a type of person willing to do anything to achieve your goals. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique than most people.. Don't wish, and wait. Ah, yes nobody likes a person that's just ""normal"". Trust me you will not regret it, if you just start making good habits for yourself. No one can stop you, because your mindset is on a whole new other level. You gotta work for it, and just love the process. People can't ketch up to you, and people will be jealous of your success. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people.

My first reason is that if you just put that action into movement, then you're powerful already. You will have haters. I say that because if you just do what you're going to say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You would want people with different personalities, not the same ones, as that would be boring. I say that because if you just do what you're gonna say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You gotta take over your life now. You will let nothing in your way. For example: You wouldn't want to meet the same people every time now would you? of course not. I find that quite lame, and boring. You are taking advantage of life, than just wasting it. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. Nobody wants to hang out, or deal with someone that is just negative all day, or a loser. You are more active, than just sitting down. You would want to meet different people, and find new things, and also most importantly learn new stuff by different people",0
"This is why I like to do excercise

Everyone has a talent or skill. Teaching other people is easy because I very intelligent. I love to play sports. It is easier because I am intelligent. I can solve the ones not even teachers can solve because I am intelligent. But they are all different. Skills that I have are: intelligence, talent and athletic.

Ways I show intelligence are by performing clever tasks, giving good ideas or advice, or teaching other people how to be intelligent like me. It is a good waty to lose weigth, lose calories and get fit. These are some ways of how and why I am intelligent.

Ways I show my talents are by showing my special abilities, intelligence, and being athletic

I am very talented in a lot of different ways. But they are all unique. I can also teach someone else something if they don't know it. These are some ways I show my talents.

I show my abilities of being athletic by playing sports, doing excercise, and running. I show my special abilities in school by using my brain to solve problems. I like to play sports and do excercise. I also like to run. I always learn and understand stuff because I am very intelligent. Everyone has a talent or a skill. Skills that I have are intelligence, talent, and athletic.. A way I show intelligence is by giving good ideas or advice when there is a problem. I am also very athletic.

"By investing in ourselves through hard work and commitment, we proudly set ourselves up for success.. Thomas Jefferson once said, “Diligence is the mother of good luck” — a sentiment that speaks to the power and rewards of perseverance. While it is tempting to indulge in inactivity and be content with minimal effort, it is important to recognize that a lack of productivity is a danger to personal fulfillment and advancement. The adage “no pain, no gain” rings true here, as hard work and dedication tend to be the ideal ingredients for setting oneself apart from the competition. 
Developing good habits and having a positive work ethic can lead to unparalleled success",1
"I would throw a fit you could say sometimes and not want to be a part of the activity at all and just straight up get mad over simplest things that just needed some time put towards them. So i could learn them or master them or someone that could have taught them to me. Instead i would give up on myself on the first time i failed at it.

But as time went by and the older i got little by little i started to try new things in life besides just other foods. Like know how to play soccer,football,and play basketball. But also there are lots of people that do not want to see you make it in life and do better then them.

This is why i strongly agree with this author by the name Ralph Waldo Emerson and his statement. I always wanted to know how to play these sports as a kid. When i did not know how to do something that other kids or people knew and could do. Some times my mom would tell me to eat my food or she would not let me go outside or take me to the park to play. I understand that know because i know there people who look out for you and help you. I think if i wouldnt have gave up on some things when i was younger i would have know how to do a lot more then i can today. I strongly agree with this statement that author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because i can relate to it based on my passed experiences as a little kid not wanting to try new things in life like other food and activities. Say if i did not know what it was or had not try in before in the past i did not want it at all. I learn that anger would help me too like this one time in middle school i was in my math class my teacher said that i could not solve the problem that he had put on the board because i did not pay attention in class. I was that type of kid that just did not like to try new thing at all. He also told me to never let what other people say stop me from achieving my goals in life and to also try to control my anger. But i ended up trying new things in life anyways and it helped change my mindset from not pushing myself to believing in myself that i could accomplish things and also help me grow as a person.

For example when i was l lot younger then i am today like a lot of kids i did not like to try new food. I think the reason for this was that my mindset was changing and i did not give up on myself anymore i started to push myself to achieve my goals. so i would eat it but not because i wanted to it was because i wanted to go play outside or go to the park because i was just full of energy all the time and always liked to be outside.

Thinking back to those memories at least the ones that i can remember i always seem to get easily upset. I did not like to try new things as a kid because when i would fail at them i would get mad or upset. That go by the lines of unless you try to do something that you have never done before you will never grow. You can be scared i life but do not let them fears keep you from having fun and enjoying life.. Its just how some people play it safe in life and do not attempt to do or try scary things in there life like rock climbing,sky diving swimming with sharks sneaking into abandon house cause its haunted by a ghost or something not like other people who live their lives with no fear. So i got mad and did my best to solve him and show him that i could solve that problem and i did after class he came up to me and told me that he was proud and that he knew i could do it cause when someone tells me i can not i get mad and work hard to prove them wrong. Instead of just watching the other people do this type of activities and enjoy themselves",0
"a person might not even be awarded that they are being influence by internet.

second claim why a person's character is influence beyond control is because they get influence by society. Internet platforms in influence in many ways some could be good , while other not quit so. Actions are a big part a person,s characteristics because your character will depend on actions.. These kind of things interfere with a person characteristic people might want to follow and do what they see on internet. Character is influence by social medias posts , YouTube videos and variables of things. Have your ever ask yourself what makes a person's character?. Some People think that a person's character is define by their actions and by what their selves choose to. good actions will be the key into having authentic and unique character.

In conclusion there are many factors that influence that a person's character.

People some often get their way of acting and doing thinks from internet platforms which could be something bad it's not take with careful. While others think that character is form by influences beyond control. People might feel that to fin in society they have to have the same characteristics and act the same as others to be accepted and tolerated by society. I agree that as individuals our character is influenced beyond our control because of , internet influence, fit in society , and by actions.

One reason why character is influence beyond control is because people get influenced by internet platforms. Today,s society can have a big impact in everyone's lives, we are living in a time were people would do whatever takes to fit in and feel like think they are part of society, but sometimes being around people is not mentally healthy. People who is pressure by others would act and do things that they know are no specifically good. By taking good actions your character will be defined in a positive and understandable way. For example you are a very respectful and kind person but they you turn into a not so kind person their has to be something making you changed the way you are and that could be other people , changing your character.

Lastly people's characteristics are influence beyond control because of the actions they take in life.

People's actions influenced the way they are and act",0
"It allows them to move forward with certainty and purpose, and to create a life that is totally unique to them. Making their own decisions is undoubtedly the best way for people to take control of their destiny and live a life of fulfillment.. Instead of relying on the judgment of others, they are free to evaluate the situation from their own perspective and find the best solution. This is a powerful form of self-empowerment, and can help people to become independent and confident. They become dependent and are likely to feel powerless and frustrated when they don't get what they want. This allows them to create a life that meets their needs and goals, and to take ownership of their lives in a meaningful way. When people make their own decisions, they take responsibility for their own successes and failures, and learn to live with the consequences of their choices. 

Ultimately, making their own decisions gives people the freedom to live their life according to the values and principles that they believe in. 

In contrast, if people rely on others to make decisions for them, they surrender any control they might have. Making their own decisions allows people to have a sense of ownership over their life, and gives them the ability to direct their own course. 
People should make their own decisions because it gives them the freedom to act according to their own values and interests. 

When people make their own decisions, they are more likely to come up with solutions that are right for them",1
"Furthermore, this extra time could mean that students have even less time to complete homework assignments at home.

Some argue that the additional hour and a half of schooling should be added as it could improve educational outcomes. They believe that students should be able to find their own ways of finding balance between study and extracurricular activities.

Ultimately, there is no clear-cut solution to the dilemma. On the one hand, the added school time could result in students having more time to devote to learning and preparation for standardized tests. The additional time spent in school could lead to fewer hours available for extracurricular activities, as well as lead to disruptive changes in students’ daily routines. However, it could also have a negative impact on their lives. However, others maintain that this additional time could be put to better use outside of the classroom. 

The school board's proposal to add an additional hour and a half to the school day has sparked much debate. It is important to weigh all factors and perspectives, as well as carefully consider how best to make use of the students’ time, both in the classroom and out.",1
"From my personal experience, I have identified three steps which, when followed consistently, have contributed to my own successes: 1) setting meaningful goals, 2) soldiering on even when facing setbacks, and 3) creating new opportunities. Taking action and actively pursuing new opportunities can be a significant catalyst to increased success.. 

When it comes to setting goals, you should identify measurable objectives that are within reach yet still challenging. When confronted with difficulties, we should persist by utilizing the resources and knowledge at our disposal. Taking the time to problem solve and maintaining high spirits can be key in ultimately overcoming obstacles and achieving desired goals.

Lastly, it is important to always be on the lookout for new opportunities. Whether it is a job offer, a hobby that sparks your interest, or a mentor to gain important new perspectives, learning new things can open doors that weren’t previously available and provide a much-needed break from daily routines. By setting achievable goals, you will cultivate a feeling of accomplishment which will increase your motivation and result in further successes.

No matter how well you plan, setbacks are always a part of life. 
I have found that the key to increasing success in life is to take small steps that lead to long-term growth",1
"I agree with this statement, because a positive attitude helps you cope more easily with the daily affairs of life. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your enviroment and the people around you.

If this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. A strong sence of responsibility always envokes positive and constructive actions. It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. I'ts as if you radiate light around you.

When you are positive, you tend to pull yourself out of negative loop and don't lose focus from what you really want to achieve, the person with a positive attitude has a better perspective of life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light.                                                                        . understand that is important to take resposibility for one's actions for example: problems in your work, family, school etc. If you adopt it as a way of your life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more succesful.

Whith a positive attitude you see the bring side of life, become optimistic and expect the best to happen. A positive thinker is never impulsive, they always wait to get clarity of a particular situation.

Being positive and calm always enable you to see both sides of the coin.

Positive attitude is the key to sucess in lifen because if you are positive you will belive and trust yourself, and you won't let negative people affect your deams, if not you will work hard until you get them and go will sucessful. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing.

Also a positive attitude leads to happiness and sucess and can change your whole life",0
"Taking ownership of our lives and learning from the hardships life throws our way can ultimately help us become more resilient and better equipped to handle future challenges.. By consciously making decisions with an awareness of our own individual experiences, we are better able to weigh our options and make decisions that are in our best interest. It is important for individuals to become aware of how their life experiences have influenced them, so they can take control of their own lives and use the hardships they have gone through to become stronger. For example, research has shown that a person's upbringing has an important role in shaping their understanding of the world and the behavior they accept as normal. Additionally, external events like death, physical illness or injury, and even day-to-day decisions can cause dramatic behavioral changes. 
The life experiences we encounter can have a profound effect on our understanding of the world and our own behavior",1
"For,exmple, Luke show to everyone what he accomplish for getting his mile run decreasing. Accomplishing goal would be the best thing that ever happed to you. For a way that people would like to accomplish something is setting a goal, try hard, and showing them.

However, many people believed that setting a goal is a accomplishment. But many people would not even try their best to accomplish some thing.

Therefor, many people could show what they accomplish. But what he did is that he accomplish something great.

As a result of accomplishing something it'swonderful thing. But for some people they set their own goal really hard and they can't even accomplish it. For those who show what they accomplish is that they usually do anything to accomplish sommething. For example, My sister when she set a goal she usually it so simple that she can accomplish it. But for some people think that is called show off. Like setting a goal, try your best,and showing what you have done. . When some people accomplish something they would usually try their best to accomplishg something. For example, my brother accomlish something for trying his best at his final. After all for those who doesn't like setting a goal would likely accomplish something.

For many people that are accomplishing something they always try really hard. When some people set a goal they usually set an easy goal, so they can accomplish. Have you ever accomplishing something by what we are doing ? Our 3rd President of the U.S.A wrote a quote that say ""Determine never to be idle .....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Many people didn't believe in him",0
"For example a person that saids thats going to do lots of things riskign everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it bacause of not being able to a list think before doing anything,by starting low can help not putting things and not taking any risk,by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path.

Setting the aims at a low risk help with not losing what it was to hard to get or to achieve,by understanding that thats what help getting far in life and not let anything fall short and just taking the time to think and overview that things that are still around and star making them better and just work on them step by step. As some may say that its good for people to chalenge themself once in a while but without risking whats around it because whats the point of being able to work so hard and by just one step that was taking without having a chance to think of what was happening and lose it all by not taking it step by step.

My oppinion is that people should considere think before doing anything because that what helps getting you on the top and not just let anything fall down in front of your face,by thinking that to risk thing and not having to even think about it for a second was going to get you to the top,and if your going to chalenge yourself make sure to think about it stuff before doing it.. People overcome themselfs because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themslef in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there.

Some people will star high thinking that by doing that they would be able to get on top of stuff and all problems that are along with that are somehow fix without putting any effort or even think about it for a second,people should star a bit lower than that because that way they can work built that character that can help with achieven their goal by just putting a bit of effort and try to not aim high and fall short. Some people may say that oppocite but to start with your aim low helps with the little mistakes that need to be fixed.

People should considere setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed,those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff.

The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams,the ones that are capable,the ones that set their aim's low and achieve a mark",0
"While there are some potential advantages, such as taking advantage of college or career opportunities, there are also possible drawbacks, such as increased stress and lack of elective courses. Therefore, students should weigh their options carefully and decide what is best for them.. 

In conclusion, it is an individual choice whether or not to finish high school early. In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships. 

On the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. 

However, finishing high school early can also lead to stress. 
Completing high school in three instead of four years is certainly a tempting idea, as it shortens the amount of time that students spend in school if they wish to enter college or the professional workforce early. Many students rely on elective courses to gain knowledge in areas they are passionate about, so this can be a problem if there isn’t sufficient time. Furthermore, those who enter the workforce at an earlier age may have more opportunities for professional development and career advancement, as they have a longer period of time to build their experiences and skills. However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider, including stress and a lack of elective classes",1
"I can get another job to work on the weekends, the thing is that it would allow me to be busy, and to generate money.

In my family, my dad is the one who is always at work, he works from 8am to 6pm everyday, he doesn't have a day off, but it is okay for him. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they won't be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. My mom, she doesn't work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldn't be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off.

In conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc.

A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they won't have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home.

Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs.

Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours",0
"For starters, students taking online classes can work around their own schedule. As long as students are following course instructions, taking classes from home can be a great way for them to learn without having to leave the house.. This allows for flexibility to attend classes, do homework, and participate in activities without having to leave their home. Another benefit is the cost savings associated with online courses. Furthermore, not having an in-person instructor means that students can’t be absent from class, which has a positive effect on their overall course grades.

Finally, if any issue does arise with an online class, more often than not there is a helpdesk or online resource available to provide support and answers to any questions. Since students don’t have to pay for transportation, or for food at cafeterias, they can save money on the overall cost of the class.

Parents can also be more trusting of their children taking classes from home since they don’t have to leave their house and their attendance is monitored. 
Taking classes from home has become more popular in recent years due to many benefits. Many online courses allow students to interact and discuss topics with their peers via video chat or instant messaging services, and this can lead to a more engaged learning experience",1
"Young people are often faced with difficult decisions such as deciding which college to attend, or what job to pursue. 
Most common societies expect students to identify a career by the age of 18 or 19. My advice to young people who are trying to figure out what career path to follow is to talk to mentors, explore different opportunities, and trust that you can make decisions that will help shape your future.. When my parents gave me four years to decide on a career, I was overwhelmed and questioned if I was making the right decision. Personally, I think the best age to start figuring out a career path is as soon as one can",1
"As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called ""No More Dream"". When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.

Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. The first death though is more painful."" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.

I got inspired by the artist I love the most. I watched their video's and I was in love with them. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is ""There are 2 deaths in life. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.

My number one talent is hip-hop. They are a band from South Korea. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on.. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. Their fan's are called ARMY. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. I learned all their dance moves from their music video's to their stage performances. They were called BTS. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move",0
"School is your second home becuase school will take you to your goal, teachers are you support if you don't have support from your family, but you got support from your good friends,and teacher. For example some parents are immingrant on this country and they did not have the opportunity that you have now so,they need to undesrtand that you want to make them pround and let you be who you want to be on this life.

Also you always have the support of the teachers during High school they will always going to push you foward it would make your future more easy because they will give you choices of that career that you want to take and help you on your classes if you are not passing a class they will give you homework to get your grades up at the end of the year you ready to the next step. When you want to become someone on this life you got to do whatever you have to do no matter if you need to work and study at the sametime. Otherwise if you don't have support from your family do never stop looking for your goals because than they will be proud of you,sometimes family give you their back when you most need a support from your own blood,but sometimes you don't have any support from them and makes you sad,depresed. That's why is a good idea to to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

In conclusion,age doesn't matter to make a dream,there's many reasons to stop your goals but do never let anything or any person stop your goal but you always going to have a support of your teacher and family,sometime you might not have any support but never stop doing what you want to be because at the end of the day you will be proud of yourself.. But if you want a good career you need to start at young age some people leave their family right after they finish High school. However for people who was independet during high school they already know how life is and it would be more easier to to leave their family,sometimes parents they don't allow you to live in another state or country because they say that you are the only daughter or son but what i said you got to do whatever you got to do to do someone on this life. Student should commit to a career at young age they will save more money, and they will independet at young age also they can work and study at the same time when they get out from High School it would to be more easier that career they want to take and you have that help of the teachers during freshman year until you finish high school. But at end of the day you have your teacher that they will never let you make you stop from who you want to be",0
"We know some students don't like doing their homework and that's why they don't get good grades.

All we want to do is help them get better at school so they can be something in life,school it's important for learning and a after school homework club can help then. An a after school club is going to help you a lot we all want kids to be good at school. We should have a after school home work club it's better for our school and students all we want is their best in school.

But it's their choice to come after school to finish their homework I know we want the best for them but it's their choice we can't make them come. I agree with the idea of after school homework club,because by actually coming to a after school homework club it can help you get better at the class you need help. I know some students think the homework is a waste of time but no it's gonna help you anytime in life. Doing your homework is gonna help you be someone in the future. We need after school homework clubs in our school, every school should have after school clubs it's for the best for every school we all need them after school homework clubs.. It doesn't matter if you get your answer wrong you learn from your mistakes by practicing you get better at it.

And by coming after school to finish your homework is great because you have time to do other activities after you finish your homework. Homework helps you raise your grades up. A lot of student are failing school because they don't do their homework you just have to try it homework helps a lot like in math,science,social studies and reading class being good at every class is going to help you in college",0
"

Overall, exploring the cities of London, India, and Japan would offer an incredible experience — one I would truly cherish.. Exploring the local cultures and immersing myself in the vibrant atmosphere would be a unique and enriching experience. With that said, there are three places I would most love to visit—London, India, and Japan. 
Traveling the world has always been a dream of mine. I would love to visit the famous Taj Mahal and witness its gorgeous architecture in person. Visiting shrines in Kyoto, strolling the streets of Tokyo, and hiking the scenic Japanese countryside would be remarkable. It would be amazing to visit all of the historic landmarks such as the Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, and Big Ben. 

London has always held a place in my heart. I would also love to take a food tour in some of London’s famous restaurants, such as outdoor pubs in Camden Town and famous seafood markets in Covent Garden.

India is another destination I would love to visit. Additionally, I would love to try some of the famous Japanese dishes and delve into its incredible art and culture. Additionally, I would love to spend time aiding some of India’s most impoverished communities. To visit the city that is the basis for many of my favorite films would be an incredible experience. 

Finally, I would love to visit Japan and explore the country’s unique attractions",1
"By expressing their unique ideas and taking independent action, individuals can become visionaries and drive positive change.

For example, visionary scientists have pushed the boundaries of understanding and have discovered groundbreaking theories that sparked important advancements in science and medicine. It encourages consideration of different perspectives and allows people to find solutions to seemingly impossible problems. Individuality is a key factor in helping people achieve their goals and ultimately make a positive difference in the world.

In conclusion, individuality is critical in allowing people to explore different paths and express their unique perspectives. Galileo Galilei, for example, was a trailblazer in astronomy who challenged convention and introduced new theories regarding the motion of planets in our solar system. It gives people the opportunity to become visionaries and drive innovative advancements in different fields, which can benefit society as a whole. By embracing individualism and exercising independent thought, people can find unlocked potential within themselves and reach great heights of accomplishments.. 
Individuality is an important trait that can help people discover and achieve great success in life. Similarly, Marie Curie showed tremendous courage and independence in her work with radiation, making revolutionary discoveries in the field that continue to impact our lives today.

These inspiring stories demonstrate how important individuality is. Not only does it inspire risk-taking and creative problem-solving, but also encourages people to think outside the box",1
"They think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldn't have done before, is a way to waste time because, you're not going to complete it anyways. Then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. This time he studied much better than the first time but he didn't pass it again, he felt stressful ""what's going on to me"" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. Adopting the failure is the way to become master and complete our goals. A way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. They also believe that it's really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you don't achieve success.

One reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. Also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal.

Those who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. First, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didn't pass it as well. Actually, we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed in something that we wanted more than one time because, being consistent is a way the learn and become successful. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail sometimes.

In conclusion, based in those reasons I support Churchill's statement, and I'm agree with the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. As result he passed the test with a good score. Then I decided con continue it and I went to take the test, I couldn't pass it at the first time. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. But should we really continue pursuing success after fail many times, even knowing that, it might be really difficult?. But, I still needed to get a car, fortunately my parents brought me one. Then, my parents decided that it was time to let me drive. But this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. As example of this is my self. Everyone have experimented failure in some point of their lives. I was really excited thinking in the way that my daily was going to change. What happened to me is a perfect example of being consistent and don't give to get success. What happened to Generic_Name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. The last year I had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. As example of this is my friend, Generic_Name, who had to take his math test multiply times. But it wasn't that easy because, firstly, I had to pass the driver test, next learn how drive and finally get a car. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times.

Other reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. Second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. Now I have a car and my driver's license even though I was hard to make it. If I hadn't been consistent even that I had failed it, I wouldn't have gotten my driver license. As the British Prime

Minister Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm"". In that point I wasn's really sure if I wanted to continue with that. If Generic_Name hadn't been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldn't have passed the text.         . Actually we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something that we want because, it's a way to learn more and a way to build our confidence, and we also become successful by being consistent. I felt sad about it, but after studying all the rules again I came back to take on this time I was able to pass it as well",0
"This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you

Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation.           . We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.

Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.

By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.

There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.

The benefits that you get does not end there. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. Another thing is the food. I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want",0
"Even more dangerously, the use of cell phones while driving can be deadly and lead to serious accidents. In extreme cases, this reliance can lead to a virtual addiction to technology, where people come to rely on it to the exclusion of all else.

In sum, it is important to proceed with caution when discussing both the benefits and harms of technology. While it can be a powerful tool to improve our lives, it also has the potential to cause serious problems if used incorrectly. . 
Technology has revolutionized our lives in countless ways, both saving us time and effort in our everyday tasks, while also introducing new dangers and potential pitfalls. 

Additionally, the pervasive use of technology can lead to a lack of social skills among its users, with a greater tendency toward solitude and less face-to-face contact with other humans. This in turn can lead to an increased susceptibility to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as well as a growing dependence on technology. For example, cell phones in schools can be an immense distraction to students, resulting in a lack of focus and a degraded quality of education. On one hand, cell phones and computers have allowed people to connect with one another in ways that were never before possible. However, this connectivity can have a dark side as well",1

Online classes offer many advantages to taking traditional classes in a physical school building. Taking an online class also leaves you with more time to focus on other activities that may not be related to study. In this environment, you have the opportunity to build close relationships with teachers and classmates by having face-to-face conversations, growing together through discussions, and participating in interesting activities. Additionally, attending a physical school allows for in-person help so you can get direct feedback from teachers if you are having difficulty understanding something. 

Though each option has its own advantages, it's important to take these factors into consideration when deciding between taking online classes or attending a physical school.. Additionally, with online classes, you have the ability to reach out for help at any time and you can pause or rewind lessons if needed. You don’t need to physically be in the same place as your instructor to get help or to learn. 

On the other hand, attending a physical school offers the ability to interact with a group of peers and the instructor in a way that is not possible in an online environment. As a result, attending a physical school allows for fostering long-term relationships that can benefit a student’s learning experience. One major positive of taking online classes is that you can attend them from anywhere in the world",1
"Additionally, advice from close friends or family can be a huge help in making decisions. They are likely to be more informed about the situation and can provide a unique perspective. Listening to others can provide insight into both why a choice should be made and why it should be avoided. For these reasons, getting input from multiple sources can be a great way to make a better decision.. Hearing different perspectives can make it easier to consider all of the pros and cons. 
Having multiple opinions can be beneficial when making a choice. It can also prompt creative solutions for the issue at hand",1
"For example, a person might choose to yield to the pressure and become more outgoing in an effort to present a certain image of themselves, or they could reject the pressure and remain true to their own values and beliefs. 
In recent years, the rise of internet platforms has had a great impact on the development of individual character. This pressure can have both positive and negative influences on a person’s character, depending on how they choose to respond to it. In either case, it is important to remember that the development of character relies heavily on a person's own decisions and actions, not on the influence of internet platforms.. This, in turn, can lead to social pressure for people to act a certain way in order to conform to ideals and expectations of others. The ubiquity of social media, particularly, has had a profound effect on how people interact and express themselves",1
"Most students who want to graduate before the years, that they should be take. I think college do not have a specific age, just with your goals to make everything without leave school is strong enough to make a year early.

Those plans do not make problem, if just a way to finish what you want many people admire those people and see their potential. Students who have a lot responsibilities and their want a diploma. If you see, passed, and remember high school lesson you will be fine, if you study and make your task these option will be good. Students with the capacity of make their mind strongest, go to their limits, and make one year early. Most students who take this decision if because they have to work and can spend much time, and they sacrifice some summers or evenings to get close their goals and each one do what is more beneficiary for their way. Schools that allow students make more short their school years, if better for most of students who want get their diplomas, enter college, and start a career. how you can involve in college: studying, focus, and remember what you see or learn.

In conclusion each student have different way to think how want to study and how many time want to spend in high school. These program is good to make steps in life. Is not important how many years do you spend in high school, the think is what is your percent of each class. Many reasons that take people to get these program, if because they usually do not have enough money, have to work, and need to study at the same time, everyone do not have the same opportunity opt for study during summer or online classes.

If you analyze students work after school, they want to get a diploma and make a force one year, when they make get one year less that say you are study and passed your classes different can be when teachers give you a year when you don't know nothing and teachers approve your year that's different go college when you have no idea how react to many classes than you never see or never show during the period of high school, the students that study during summers or in the evenings are focus in their classes that's because they finish fast and go college to involve in a new goal.

Example if you go school and need to work you'll to opt for study in summer or in the evenings that's your best option, students follow to take courses because it's a better idea maybe do not be the same learning, but with effort you can advance. For me, if a good option opt for finish fast school and start a new stage in our life.. when a student have a early year because want a start to make a goals",0

Being part of a team and have interaction with other people can be very supporting. For example, our character grows and develop in a stronger and confident personallity. It keep us healthy and stronger. In my opinion, 1. To keep on doing you have to get out there and give everything you have. Our rate of achivement will be higher. To conclude, doing will always have a purpose.

In conclution, we can accomplish more by doing. we can accomplish more if we stay active,

"It's more easier and less distracted. But are students really doing educational purposes? Should students really use their phones in their classrooms? Are students actually getting education? This is what I think about cell phones used in classes.

Most students get distracted by using their cell phones especially in class. But i feel like the teachers should at least stop us from getting distracted. Than that's when they should let them use it. . But then I think why they took it and how many time I lost. Most of us can handle the distracting than others.

Most teachers actually let their students use their phones and don't really pay attention to their students. Maybe not everyone feels the same, thinks the same, are the same. But a real emergency. That's what I think about teachers letting their students use their cell phones during classes. I feel like every school should at least have laptops to give out for their students. Most students do get mad at teachers when the teachers stop us from using our devices. Only if it's in an emergency. I feel more free, relax, I feel good to be honest. Honestly cell phones had ruined many peoples life's. Even toddlers these day all they do is come back from school and play on their parents cell phones or their losing sleep to watch videos .

I honestly don't think cell phones are healthy at all not even in education. Teachers shouldn't let their students use their phones at all. And if you're a teacher and let your student do their

""work"" in their cell phone, just know they might not be doing their ""work"" in their cell phones.

Some students might care more about their education then the things that's going on in life. Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. But do students know it for our own good.

When my parents take my phone away. I do get a bit mad at first. I feel like i'm back in reality and just leaving my moment god gave me. It might be our responsibility to be on track. They might be capable to use their cellphones without getting distracted. Everyone gets distracted I know but thousand of teen are obsess with their phones. Because a lot of websites are blocked",0
"Some people believe students need to take a music, a drama, or art classes. Many others students do not like music or drama claases, students have oportunity if they can choose electives classes so they can have few classes, they can have more time after school if they have a job.

Second reason, is students have more oportunity to choose classes tehy like, many others students doesn't like arts or drama classes, in my opinion this is a good idea students can choose classes they like, this help students to work in classes they like and have a good grades.

Last reason, students can choose classes with more oportunity, students can choose classes can help then to get credit for the diploma, students can talk witg teachers they can help then to get claases they need, this is a oportunity to students they work after school, this can help many students to get a good grades and pass all they classes.

In conclusion, this argument can help students to choose classes that can help then to pass the grade or maybe to graduated, this have many oportunity to choose electives classes, in my opinion i dont like drama and arts classes. There is a debate abou to take a musica, a drama, or arts claas, should students need to take a electives classes. Finally students can choose the claases they need to graduate.

First reason, is students can choose the classes they need , so they can have more oportunity to choose the classes they need for get the diploma, they can choose the classes for get more credit, this is a good idea students can choose a electives classes so tehy can talk with the teachers to choose classes tehy need to graduated.                       . I believe students need to take electives classes , so students can choose the classes they need , students have more oportunity to choose classes they like, and they can choose the classes with more opportunity for get more credit",0
"Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. Work even harder then you worked before. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. .These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Raplh Waldo statement.. Based on my experieneces, do I agree or disagree with Emerson's statement. Not only just NBA players work hard, other people around the world has stories to tell on how they never stopped working harder than before to grow. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest. For example Lebron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now",0
"In addition people will get better at what they do. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience.

Many people grow by trying new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. People will be more educated in that topic and help others.

While many people think you can not grow. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings.

Many people may succeed when they try new things. Working Beyond

Do you need to work beyond what you have mastered to grow? Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better.

Finally people gain more experience. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

In conclusion people who go above and beyond grow because they have done more to help them grow and become better and to succeed. In addition they will know their way around. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn.             . Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. You should try and go beyond and see if you grown. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. People will become more successful",0
"In every situation, it is best to remain truthful, even if it means navigating difficult conversations or enduring lasting damage to a relationship.. 
Excerpt:
    The proverb “Honesty is the best policy” is often viewed as an ideal for how we should behave. Honesty implies a commitment to telling the truth, no matter the consequences. To summarize, being honest is always preferable to dishonesty. On the other hand, dishonesty often carries negative repercussions because it involves stealing, cheating, lying, and hiding important facts. While being honest can sometimes lead to hurt feelings or a loss of trust, it can also create positive benefits in multiple areas",1
"He praised me and courage me to do better. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.

According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.

Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.

I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.      . For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.

In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence",0
"Furthermore, the privacy risks associated with allowing students to use their phones in class are a matter of great concern. As such, it is important for teachers and administrators to take into account the implications of allowing student to use their phones during class and weigh the pros and cons of doing so. Additionally, studies have shown that students are more engaged and have higher levels of satisfaction when their teachers utilize technology in the classroom. 
In recent years, the question of whether students should be allowed to use cellphones in the classroom has become increasingly prominent. Ultimately, it is up to each school to determine if allowing student to use cellphones during class is beneficial or detrimental to the learning environment.. 

However, cellphones can also be a distraction in the classroom environment, leading students to check their social media, play games, and text message instead of paying attention to the teacher. On the one hand, it can be beneficial if used appropriately; on the other, it can be disruptive if abused. Research has shown that, when used responsibly and in moderation, cellphones can benefit students in their education by providing easy access to online resources, facilitating collaboration, and helping students remember tasks and deadlines",1
"one time me and my dad was working on the engine of a car he tells me this is how it works or how to fix it. He teaches me a lot about life he says that life isn't always easy or simple,sometimes in life it can be bad or hard but he would always say keep your head up and never be down on yourself. In conclusion it is important to learn from other's that are experience too, Because you will learn new things or will will new thing's that they will say that you don't know of in life its really good if you get to know a new person and get to know them and hear what they say or there experience that you dont know of. And it's great to learn new thin'g about the person that you meet or already know because you will find new thin's about that person and you will learn about that thing is you liesn to them. My dad is someone who has shared wisdom and experience with me these are the thing's that my dad shared wisdom and experience,He show's me his experience that he has,He shows me wisdom that he has that he gain,He teaches me about life.

My dad show's me experience like working on the cars he showed me what to do for working on the cars. It's better to learn about there wisdom and the experience because once you know there wisdom and experience you will tell them your experience and your wisdom that you know of that you got from your parents or your other friends.. when he tells me about life I feel like I can do stuff in the future that I would take off and be sussesful in the future. My dad is a really good dad he show's me wisdom and experience and other stuff to like he helps me in stuff. And its cool when my dad talks to me about life. He show's me wisdom,my dad he would tell me to not give up on something,when I can't do something and it's hard to do it my dad would tell me to not give up you can do it believe in your self",0
"This thought process can help to ensure that one’s hard work and dedication are directed towards realistic goals and have the best possible outcome.. 

Additionally, taking small risks can help to spur innovation and growth in one’s life. 

Ultimately, it is important to think before taking any kind of action. 
Many people become overwhelmed when they have a lofty goal in mind – whether it be a dream job, a lifestyle change, or an entirely new career. This strategy helps to build character, create a roadmap for success, and instill a sense of hope and accomplishment. Instead, small risks should be balanced against both short-term and long-term goals, and should create positive opportunities that lead up the ladder of success. Setting the aim too high can backfire, leading to discouragement and even failure. Instead of attempting to reach the top in one large leap, it is beneficial to set the aim slightly lower and take achievable steps forward. It is important to remember, though, that risks should not be taken at the expense of one’s safety and wellbeing. Whether it is setting the aim high or low, weighing the risks and benefits of any endeavour is key to achieving success",1

Extending the school day can be both a blessing and a curse for students. This could lead to excessive stress on students, longer days of being in a focused state, and ultimately exhaustion. 

On the other hand, the extended school days might put an overwhelming amount of pressure on students. With the extended school day, students may be able to engage in more in-depth learning, be able to learn at a faster pace, and have more individualized attention in classes as the school day is more spread out. On the one hand, four days of school can be fewer school days in a week and may allow students to feel less overwhelmed with work and have more free time to do what they love. It could also result in less time overall that children spend on screens or electronic devices throughout the week, as they will have more days free to explore and engage in activities with friends and family. 

Despite the potential drawbacks, there are potential benefits from having four days of school. Some educators and parents have posited that students could experience a “work smarter, not harder” approach with four days to spread their work out over the extended school day, promote student-driven learning, and potentially have classes that are more engaging. Additionally, there may be a potential financial burden that may come with the extended school days, such as the need to hire more staff and administration and the potential for less hands-on learning if resources are cut. It is essential that a thorough analysis of these potential changes to the educational system be done to foster an environment that is conducive to long-term student success.. 

In conclusion, the pros and cons of extending the school day and having four days a week are complex and varied. Having four days of school instead of five may result in more hours of scarce study time, more challenging teacher expectations, and more cumulative material to cover",1
"But inactivity also serve as a purpose because some people aren't doing anything so they have time to finish and accomplish something because they are not doing anything

The first reason that inactivity should serve as a purpose is because people that aren't doing anything should be able to accomplish their work and other work so that they did not finish and they dont have an excuse to not do work. The second reason is that they don't accomplish work when they are doing something because they won't have time to finish the other work or they rush ans make a lot of mistake on their work and will get a bad report are grade on it so thats why some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing other things.

So inclusion some people accomplish their work and some don't also inactivity serve as a purpose for people that are done with their work but class or they are still work should not just sit there and do nothing they should get more work in till they leave the class or their jobs.. Some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing something because if they are then they might not have time to do the other work they are given or they might be busy with the hard work first then maybe finish the work. On the other hand people doing work have an excuse because if they are given a lot for work they might not have time to finish the other work but the people that finish working and have some time left should be given more work in till they done have anymore time at school or at work.

The first reason why people accomplish something when they are doing something is because they work and don't waste time at school or work but sometime",0
"Everyone benefits and leaves with a more nuanced understanding of the world, and how generations work together to create and learn.. 

This type of program should benefit students from primary school to university level. This type of program is important in order to bridge the gap between the generations, build understanding, and foster collaboration. It also gives children and teens the opportunity to learn from experienced adults, and adults the chance to stay informed on technological developments. Moreover, these programs give students a platform to understand the different perspectives, beliefs, and values of the older and younger generations. University students can gain valuable insight and access resources from experienced colleagues as mentors. Teacher facilitated co-learning settings can help kids build connections that will help them succeed and grow in the long-term. 
Intergenerational educational programs are a great way for both young and old students to come together and learn from one another while also helping each other",1
"With this plan, I am confident that John will have the tools to succeed in the classroom.. I believe it would be helpful for John to attend after school classes or join sports to help him increase his understanding of the material and improve his grades.

First, I plan to meet with John one-on-one and explain why these activities would be beneficial. Lastly, I'll tell John about another student in our class who was struggling academically and attended after school classes which led to an improvement in the student's grades.

After this conversation, it is my hope that John will be encouraged to enroll in these activities. 
John is a student in my class who is having trouble understanding our course material. I will explain how the after school classes and sports will provide an opportunity for him to learn in more depth and ask questions. I will also discuss how the increased physical activity could help him stay motivated and focused in class",1
"Community service is an invaluable experience, but compelling students to participate can quickly turn it into a chore rather than something meaningful. While making it optional may lead to fewer people engaging in community service, it also allows those that do participate to do so out of genuine interest and passion. This passion and enthusiasm can be contagious, inspiring more people to become involved and make community service a more integral part of their lives.. 
I believe that community service should be optional for students",1
"life is never easy. How is this going to help me in life. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. Don't take your anger out on others. You don't know what can happen if you rush things in life. I didn't have hope. if we dont how can we know things will get better.

We need to have hope to learn the lesson.

The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind.

For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. But that didn't help. But then i realized why am i thinking negative? and not trying. Everything will get better. Give things time, be patient. Life teaches us a lesson. thats how life is. Nothing but to hope that they will get better. We need to believe, have hope in life. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson.

Don't rush things in your life. That's not going to help you in life. . Just don't think negative. I started to believe. Because when you grow up you won't be able to go back

In the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. Enjoy it bore it ends.

Everyone goes through something in their life. Enjoy your life as much as you can. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick. Always look up never down. Taking your anger out on someone who didn't do anything is not going to help. Things got harder for me. I would share that life is not easy. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. enjoy your childhood. Cause if you do look down you won't see your bright future that will come.

Do good things in your life. I opened my eyes and began to try. Like be nice to people don't be rude, disrespectful, and mean. what's the point of being mean. It helped me a lot. Its's making the problem worse. life is full of lessons that will teach us something",0
"Additionally, there could be drawbacks to the community. This could lead to an increase in stress levels since students will have less time for rest and leisure activities. Ultimately, a decision should be made carefully, and include taking into consideration things like potential physical and mental health effects, educational benefits and potential community impacts.. 
Extending the school day by two hours could potentially provide students with a number of benefits. With additional time, students could benefit from smaller class sizes, less competition for resources and access to more subjects. Furthermore, by allowing students to have more time for projects and assignments, they may improve their academic knowledge and skills. Furthermore, without adequate compensation, teachers may struggle to accommodate the extra burden, leading to poorer overall educational standards. 

However, extending the school day by two hours could have potential negatives as well. A longer school day may mean that fewer people are available to work, as well as decrease job availability for those providing after school activities for children. 

In conclusion, while there are potential benefits for students in extending the school day by two hours, there are also possible drawbacks for teachers, students, and the community. Studies show that longer school days can provide students with more time for socializing, which can have positive effects on physical and mental health",1
"By allowing these students to access their phones in moderation during class, they are able to stay on top of their studies and stay productive. 
As our school's principal, I'm sure you are aware of the rising issue of phone usage in classrooms. There is no denying that there are certain drawbacks to allowing phones to be used in schools, such as potential for distraction and abuse of technology. This will help to promote a more academic and organized atmosphere in our classes.

Additionally, using phones can be a great educational resource. Through apps and websites, students have access to a wealth of information which can foster greater student engagement and facilitate more meaningful class discussions. I therefore believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage is the most beneficial for our students.. 

Allowing students to use their phones during class can bring about many educational benefits which aid in fostering an enriching learning environment. Furthermore, students can use their phones to snap photos of course materials and diagrams for future reference. Fortunately, I believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage can bring more benefits than drawbacks to our students.

For starters, many students use their phones for organizational purposes, such as setting reminders of upcoming assignments and activities",1
"As a result, our good examples can create opportunities for us, provide stability in our surroundings, and help us create a powerful legacy that can last for generations.

One example of how setting a good example can lead to positive outcomes is the story of Malala Yousafzai. Throughout his long-fought battle against racism and racial injustice, he remained hopeful and peaceful, never resorting to violence in spite of the violence meted out against him and his supporters. He demonstrated to the world that by remaining steadfast in his beliefs and displaying unwavering courage in the face of oppression, he created a legacy of peace and justice.

In conclusion, setting a good example is essential for achieving positive outcomes both for ourselves and those around us. Though she was born in a part of the world known for its patriarchal values, she persevered and fought for equal opportunities for girls’ education. It can be as simple as exhibiting positive behaviors, such as being kind to others, showing understanding, and exuding a sense of warmth. Establishing good behaviors, such as kindness, understanding, and courage, can help us create the legacy of a lifetime and inspire generations.. also serves as an inspiring example of setting a good example. 
Setting a good example is one of the best ways to inspire and positively influence those around us. She spoke out against the injustice, sparking a movement and becoming a symbol of strength and courage for millions of young girls around the world. 

The late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. These traits can inspire others to believe, respect, and trust us",1
"Too often, people find themselves repeating daily routines, with no excitement or enthusiasm. 
No matter who you are, it is important to accomplish something in life. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small. By setting goals and challenging yourself, you can stay motivated and interested, and experience new levels of fun and energy. Not only will you improve yourself, but you will reap the rewards of feeling satisfied and proud of your accomplishments.. For example, if you like to play video games, you might challenge yourself to beat a new game or break a personal score. Also, if you take on a challenge, like learning a new language, you feel more confident in your abilities. Being proud of your accomplishments will only build up your resilience and confidence, and make you more likely to push yourself to achieve more. For instance, if you set a goal to get in shape, working out consistently and seeing results will give you a sense of accomplishment.

Finally, accomplishing something is a great way to gain pride in one's accomplishments. For example, if you set a goal to save money, do something meaningful when you reach it, such as going out for dinner with friends or treating yourself to something special. 

In conclusion, there are numerous reasons to accomplish something in life. 

Another reason to accomplish something in life is to avoid boredom",1
"For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class.

Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Support our opinion on this subject at www. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects.

In conclusion, I believe music, drama, and art should classify as an elective because students may find that the class is not of interest to them, students can also have an interest in a certain job, and some students would not take these classes serious and take it as an opportunity to horseplay. I believe music, drama, or art class should be classified as electives because some students might not be interested in these classes due to them are wanting to learn more about other subjects, consequently failing; furthermore, students may also have an interest in a certain job and do not need these classes, students can also find these classes a waste of time because they are learning a subject that is not aiding their future, students would also not take these classes serious because they are not necessarily an essential.

First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. org.

In clousion, this is why students should take art, music, drama as their elective class. Also, art can do things for the student because while time pass and they are great in drawing it could take him or her to collage it could make better digree collage. Drama is a great elective class because students get to move around and have fun and dance. Art is a great elective class because tehy can have more credits and they can learn more interesting things in that class. That ways they can get credits for doing these classes.

First reasoon, student can learn what happens in that class like art. For example, if you also can be in a art contest in your school or anywhere else.

Secondly, students can do these classes. However, music is also a great elective class because it could help you like in school and anywhere else because they know how you sing",0
"Not only does this field provide the opportunity to understand why people think and behave the way they do, but it also offers the potential to help create positive changes in people's lives. In high school, I had the opportunity to attend a variety of seminars and lectures on the subject and it was one of my greatest sources of inspiration.

"For these reasons, many parents and experts feel there are benefits to a 10 pm curfew, as it sets a framework for teens to get enough rest while still being able to maintain an active lifestyle. 

The argument over whether teenagers should have a 10 pm curfew revolves around the tradeoff between safety and rest. As well, some people may consider a 10 pm curfew as overbearing, potentially giving parents too much control over their children. 

On the other hand, there may be counter-arguments to a 10 pm curfew, such as the fact that teens may simply stay home, rather than engage in activities that contribute to their development and growth. The goal should be to find a happy medium that provides both safety and adequate rest to teenagers.. Research has shown a direct correlation between lack of sleep and poor academic performance, risky behavior, depression, and other issues among adolescents. 

In conclusion, while the benefits of a 10 pm curfew should not be overlooked, it’s important to take into consideration the potential drawbacks that come with it",1

"Online school could not only help scholars to graduate on time, but also help a portion of scholars that are looking to get a job for future education, or helping their households. Online school may also help economy by allowing students to have enough free time to get a job to help in their households, and their future. Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work. Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Online school a great tool for young scholars that might not graduate on time due to missing school days, or any other inconvenience.

In conclusion online school might have many issues but once its issues have being solved and students get help with access to computers, or internet it could make a big impact on young scholars.

"Ultimately, there will always be advantages and disadvantages to choosing a career at a young age, but for those looking to focus on a specific goal and get a head start, it can be a great option.. Those opposed to making a career choice in their youth are concerned that it will prevent them from exploring other options in other fields, or even from forming an in-depth understanding of their chosen industry. 

From Zuckerberg’s success story, we can see that committing to a career early in life can set young people up for higher levels of achievement. Rather than wasting time exploring several unrelated fields, committing to a career at a young age allows students to gain valuable experience and hone their skills, paving the way for possible success. 

No matter which side of the argument you fall on, there are countless examples of people who achieved their goals despite settling for a career path while they were still young. One example is Mark Zuckerberg, who was a 19-year-old Harvard sophomore when he launched the now widely popular platform, Facebook. On the other hand, those supporting choosing a career early believe that it gives young people a chance to focus on a specific goal and gives them the determination to strive for it. 
Choosing a career at a young age has both its advantages and disadvantages",1
"People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now.

No mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody.      . They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because that's all you ever known growing up. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior.

Being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. I despise it when someone your close to says ""you can't be like me you have to be better than that."" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a person's behavior. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. For teenagers this is who decides for them if they'll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriend's baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. So staying away from words that can't be used in a school or around familly is your best bet.

A celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then they're praised for it",0

When discussing the consequences of success and failure, Winston Churchill's quote serves as an inspirational reminder that persistence is the key in achieving success. According to Churchill, success and failure are temporary states. 

I eventually got back on track and was able to perform better in my academics. It was not an easy or quick fix, but the courage I had to continue on changed my path towards success. 

I recall my freshman year of college when I was struggling academically due to personal issues and other challenges. It is not the destination that should be focused on, but rather the journey to get there. Instead of giving up, I decided to start studying more consistently, look for support and guidance from professors, and build strong relationships with a close group of friends. Churchill's wise words still echo in my head and motivate me every day. Whether it's with my academic goals or personal goals, I always remind myself that success isn't final and failure isn't fatal, and that it is the courage to continue that really counts.. It felt like giving up was the only option, but I knew deep down that I had to push through it and be courageous in order to reach my goals. The true test of individual character is the courage to keep going in the face of challenging circumstances",1
"For all these reasons, first impressions can be incredibly important and should be observed carefully.. 
First impressions can have a lasting impact on one’s life. A favorable first impression could be the difference between feeling accepted or rejected, and might even be a defining factor in maintaining meaningful connections. Unfortunately, the task of changing one’s first impression can be a difficult and arduous one, and requires persistence and effort. It’s no wonder people are often concerned with the impression they make upon first meeting someone. Furthermore, it can affect people's ability to find success in their future endeavors. Although a first impression can be challenging to change, it is possible to alter perspectives over time. It is also important to recognize the effects the impression can have on relationships and future success",1
"We ended up working together for many years and built a solid relationship of trust and understanding.

Having patience when meeting someone for the first time is also key. For example, when I first started working at my new job, I made sure to smile and shake my manager's hand firmly to give a friendly impression. 
Making a good first impression is important as it can shape how we are seen and treated by those around us. This teaches us the importance of understanding and taking the time to develop relationships with others in order to see past first impressions.. Having a positive first impression can go a long way in establishing trust and rapport with others, while having a negative first impression can lead to suspicion and unease. I once had a negative first impression of a colleague due to a misunderstanding, but as I got to know them better and became more patient, I found that I actually liked and respected them",1

"For example, each person might have a good suggestion or reason on a history project that will help their group with the assignment. Many students should work together as a team in school because it helps them with good life skills life. For example, when a students is working on the computer for a certain projects in fashion marketing, fitness and foods or other subjects in school because they're able to finished it themselves. Who wants to work alone by themselves when you have the chance to work together with a group of students in your class. Also people would't have to worried about not getting each slides done because their peers would be there to support them. For example, the person is writing a essay for class on Google docs with each other it helps them talk and get feedback from a peer or friend in class. Nevertheless the oppositions over looks other important points.

First reason is that student can collaborate with other peers but only about 30% of people work together with other people on school projects assignments or activates. This explains that people can put their own ideas and will get the work done more quicker without any help from peers during class. Benefits of working with a group is more beneficial because allows students to collaborate, allows different ideas or opinions from peers, and allows each individual to have feedback from peers.

However not everyone would agree with this position.                                                  . I agree that working with a group is more efficient and help students learn more better. Students can enjoy and have fun working with friends also everyone will get a good grade.

Second reason is students can come together as a team by listening and hearing out all of their peers creative ideas and opinions in a group on the project. Working together is more beneficial because with a group you can get all the work done more faster and students are less worried. Some people believe that benefits of working alone is more helpful for themselves. People might need this to help them when working at a job in the future. This shows that having a students help is important because you can fix the error in the essay with a peers correction and students can learn more better together from people.

To conclude that working with a group is more better for people because allows students to collaborate with peers so that people can separate the task with each other, allows different ideas or opinions from peers when each person has good suggestions for projects and allows individuals to get feedback from peers on helping a students with a english writing essay. This shows a person will have many ideas that they can chose from a peer in their group and it's always nice to use different reasons from a student.

Third reason is when a student can get a individuals feedback to help them on a english writing essay in class. This shows that students who work together with peers they are not only benefiting themselves but helping other people too. Maybe good for students to work alone but working in a group is helpful to have someone support them. For example, in classrooms students have more possible chances to separate the task with each other",0
and if your in school and you went to class and show up on time teachers can use you as an example for coming in on time being ready to do your work and people will look up tp that and say i want my teacher to use me as an example and start doing the same thing they'll be on time and ready to do there work. . is setting an good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people or are there better ways too influence others my opinion is that setting a good example can influence other people around you why because if they see you do something good they might catch on and say oh since he was being nice im start doing the same thing and start doing good deeds and that will help others because than people will start catching on and start being to nice to everyone. it also helps with safety too if there was something going down like a robbery or a shooting adults will probaly try yo protect the younger kids and than when some adults see some kids by themeselves they will see other adults and run to protect more kids. your setting example for the younger kids because most of the kids look up to there older siblings saying when i grow up i want to be like them so setting an example for the youth or anybody is great,0

    One of the biggest issues to be considered when changing the summer break to June and August and eliminating spring break is the effect on students and teachers. This could help to make up for the lost spring break and enable students to have time off from their studies.. Teachers could be put under increased pressure as they would have to ensure that students meet their year-long educational goals without the extra week in the spring. Another solution would be for schools to offer extended summer breaks, where students could take a longer break in between June and August. The loss of spring break could lead to higher levels of stress and frustration, especially among those who have been looking forward to vacations or time off from school work. 

To try and make up for the lost spring break, schools could introduce activities that simulate a break in the middle of the year. For students, this means that they would lose out on a week off that they usually look forward to. One idea could be a week of fun activities that take place at the end of the school year, with events like organized trips, workshops, and games",1
"On one hand, it has allowed us to be more connected than ever before, with people around the world able to communicate quickly and easily. In many ways, technology has made our lives easier and more convenient. Additionally, some technologies have caused problems such as cyberbullying and data breaches, resulting in safety and security risks. For example, being constantly exposed to screens can lead to eye strain, headaches, fatigue, and poor posture. 
Technology has been both a blessing and a curse when it comes to humans. By limiting how much time we spend using these devices, we can reap the benefits of being connected without sacrificing our health or security.. 

On the other hand, technology has had some negative consequences. Studies have shown that too much time spent using technology can have a serious impact on our mental and physical health. It has also enabled us to access vast amounts of knowledge, with just a few clicks of the mouse. 

Ultimately, the key to avoiding the potential negative effects of technology on humans is to use it in moderation",1

This program that let you take courses during the summer can be a great option to finish high school quickly, the aim of this study is to, so students get out of high school, and have enough time to start processing and think about what want to do in college or start working to help out their parents on necessary things, such as, bills, rent, and etc.

However, not all student would take this action, it emphasized that students may not have time, it can affect their sleep schedule, and not completing school. Not everyone likes high school year, therefore it is the great way to graduate early and accomplish to get into your dream college school. I can assure one can accomplish something for their goal in the future. and soon I'll start working, and apply for a scholar ship, also applying to universities or colleges that i would like to attend to,

In conclusion, many people may not agree or join the programs, we all have different opinions, different beliefs, this program can help many students to start off thinking majors,work, so therefore, I'd recommend students to take this offer, and see where it can take you. . Some, of course, may think that you're not learning fulfilling, for instance, regular school year is like ten months and if one take the programs, you're only taking extra courses during the whole summer, that's like saying you're missing a whole ten months of school. One can be to get high school out of the way",0
"Everyone had some hard time getting used to the school being shy in all, they get the other older students to assist the younger ones. But they studied so hard to get a good grade. Say we get a bad grade and they try so hard to get the perfected score. Programs that pairs older with younger, some younger kids gets used to a new school thats hard for them, if they have trouble in classes. the older and younger kids could be able to work with each others.

It's hard getting used to a new school for other people seeing new people,new classes getting to know other people,making new friends, and everyone gives time for the school. Its good that each schools are doing this to help pther students. So they assist someone.

So the schools created these things to help other students if they are having troubles with there grades, their classes, assist the students get there grades up so they can get better and better. If new students are having difficult time in this school,classes,people then they should send someone to help them out a little. They help each others for reasons to get a good grade. They can get a school a chance make new friends get better in school and then they could help other students to get good grades this is a good program for the other students. . They should be able to work with each other they can do this program so that the schools have new students. For some people it could be easy for the others really hard whether it's elementary, middle , high school thats hard getting ti know the school",0
"Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it.

It could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jr's ""I Have A Dream"" speech. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing. Only by setting an example can others follow. I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. In the past that might have been the best way to influence people, but in modern day society a majority of people are influenced by action and examples. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. In this essay, i'll be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something.

First of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends.

Secondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these ""Challenges"" that you hear on the news every other day?

In conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. A single persons actions can change how other people act. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food.                                                                                                                                                                                                           . Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing""",0
"              . It would be hard without imagination. you use your imagination to get knowledge. You would need to take notes and study from it. Its ok to make mistakes while learning, you just have to learn from them.

In conclusion I think imagination is more important. Some people think its the other way around were knowledge is more important than imagination. We wouldnt know much because we get our knowledge from our imagination. imagination and knowledge could be used for a lot of things. you can do many more things with your imagination. We use out imagination every day. you can build things, draw things,and create things from your imagination. I think that imagination is more powerful than knowledge because you can come up with many things and in order to get knowledge on something you need imagination.

Imagination is something you need to come up with things. We learn things every day. Scientist Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree with what Albert Einstein said. You need to think about it first, get the things you need to create it, and then study from it. Imagination can help you a lot, You can use your imagination to your advantage, you can use it keep you busy. You can also use you imagination while you read. You can learn so much from your imagination and its very useful. Imagination has no limits.

In order to get knowledge of something, you would need to use your imagination. Imagination can be used for a lot of things like making a cartoon show, drawing, and thinking. we have to be careful with our imagination and our knowledge",0
"Also, students have other thing to do for example they might have to go see their family. They, would have more projects, more class work students would have a hard time focusing when doing their class work. Students would go around the school an start drama every where then, students would have a hard time focusing in class. Students would not like to have in extra half an hour.

Second, students would have more drama every day at school because of the extra half an hour. Students would have a hard time with home work or studying. Having an extra half an hour would then be a problem because it would be more work, drama and other thing. For instances many of the students would have to study after they did class work they would not want to study in the mean time they would want to take a break. Having a extra half an hour would not be good for the school because students would not be focus in class.

First, students would have more class work. Although having an extra half an hour would have many problems students would most likely have more drama then ever before.

Lastly, having an extra half an hour students would not like having it because students would be messing thing, such as football games, soccer games maybe even a cook out at the park with their family. Many students would most likely not like having extra school time because they have other thing to do. Then, students would start drama at school then, students would not be focus in class. Also having the extra half an hour would change every thing students then, would not have time to do the thing they like to do like going to their friend house or play outside, because of the extra half an hour.

In conclusion having the school board plan to add one an half hour to the school each day would mean that students would not want to come to school. Students would have more class work like math or home work. Also having more time in school students would then mess other thing beside school. Students would have more drama each day at school. I disagree with school the board of adding one an half hour each day to school. Then, their grades would start going down.                 . Because, of the extra half an hour students would have to wake up in the morning and thing about the school extra half an hour and students would have more class work, study more for a subject. Having an extra hour would not be so good because students then, would be messing the thing they do not want to mess",0
"The students in a classroom will want to be outstanding students so they will trying the best they can and start to progressing to reach that goal. My suggestion is to start praising great students to make they and others to feel the ambition to be better every day and create a smart, competitive and happy environment.. Students who are praising for a great job will help they to improve teir skills and do better jobs every day and become outstanding students.

In conclution, the source of true self-steem is archievement because when a great student is praising will have the ambition to improve every day more to become a better student. People who have a success life can be because they haved teachers who praising they for doing outstanding school's project so, this inspirated they to try the best they can and be a successful person in their future. Students with a good self-steem will be doing a better job and will make true the things their love. Praising students who did a great job will be benefitial for the entire classroom becoming a positive environment and making the students more active to do a better job to be praising like an outstanding student and this help they to progress and do things better.

students will have the ambition to improve their skills and archieve someting to their future. Praising great students can help to other students to try to do a better job like that great student and be praising like they. People who are preising for a good work will feel great and ready to start a new project to progress in life. Positive personalities become to a good self-steem also, this make a better environment. Praising students help they to improve their skills and doing their best. Students feel great when someone is praising them so, this help they to feel better and happy. However somepeople believe praising a student's work to build self-steem is a good idea nevertheless, I think the source of true self-steem is archievement because, praising students who did a great job will feel amazing and also, it helps to have a better self-steem and students will have the ambition to improve their skills and archieve something to their future.

Praising students who did a great job will feel amazing and also, it helps to have a better self-steem. Being a successful person in life require some essential things. Successful person is someone who achieve goals in life and make dreams true. Students with a good self-steem and smartness will want to have a great future and the ambition to be a better student every day",0
"Smiling is such a simple thing but it can make such a huge difference; smiling can make other people around you happier too, and it can also help boost your own mood. 
Having a good attitude is incredible beneficial. It can also help you stay ahead in difficult times; strategies for maintaining a positive attitude during these times include manifesting positive thoughts, writing out your feelings in a journal, devising a plan to tackle the challenge head on, being grateful for the good things in life, and turning your negative thoughts into something positive. It can help you become successful in life, make relationships stronger, make work tasks easier, and have a general feeling of wellbeing. People who achieve success often credit their positive attitude in helping them to succeed, and it can be inspiring to research some historical and modern-day examples of how having a good attitude can be a key factor in reaching success. Remaining true to yourself is also important; even though being positive is important, your own beliefs, feelings and opinions shouldn't be sacrificed to stay upbeat.. Being positive can be even more important during challenging times, as it can give you the inner strength and belief to do really great things",1
"Ultimately, distance learning classes have opened up new possibilities for students in terms of learning opportunities, as well as potential pitfalls in terms of difficulty in maintaining motivation and expectations for their own education.. 
The development of distance learning classes has dramatically altered the way students approach their schooling. On one hand, the lack of structure and supervision can allow students the freedom to take more responsibility for their own learning, but on the other hand, it can lead to neglect of their educational obligations. Some students may take advantage of the lack of structure present in these classes by skipping classes and engaging in activities that are non-academic in nature. This type of self-imposed irresponsibility can have an immensely negative impact on their motivation and expectations for their learning. Distance learning classes have provided students with more opportunities to become self-directed and self-motivated, while creating new obstacles to overcome when it comes to taking responsibility for their own education",1
"Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades.

One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. Every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Learning from home won't have the distractions that a classroom has. There are many more opportunities with public schools. In a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. On the other hand. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do.

My conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. This is not help a student's learning at all. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want.

There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. If a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won't stress about work. The students can focus on their studies.

When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. At home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a student's work.. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. People from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers",0
"On the positive side, having a curfew can help to ensure that teens are safe and in a secure environment at night, restricting the potential to engage in risky behaviors such as drinking, drug use, or being on the streets with potential predators. 
When debating the merits of instituting a curfew for teens, it's important to look at both the pros and cons of such a rule. Additionally, a curfew could encourage more responsible spending on the part of teens by forcing them to stay home and increasing the amount of time spent on studying, sleeping, and engaging in other positive, healthy activities. Furthermore, a curfew rule could be difficult to enforce, as police officers would have to take time away from more important duties such as patrolling the streets and responding to emergencies. 

Ultimately, it is important to evaluate both the pros and cons of implementing a curfew rule for teens before making a decision. Although there may be some potential benefit to this policy, it is important to consider the potential downsides and determine if the pros outweigh the cons.. 

On the other hand, enforcing a curfew could have some drawbacks. For instance, it could stifle creativity and socializing amongst teens, as they may feel more confined and restricted to their homes. Imposing a curfew could also undermine parent-child relationships, leading to an increased feeling of mistrust on both sides",1
"Furthermore, when those around us set examples of excellence, it often improves the quality of the entire group by pushing one another ever higher.

In conclusion, setting an example is an effective way to gain influence within modern day society. In the same vein, setting an example can be a powerful force for cognitive growth and social change. This is because individuals are more likely to assimilate into the groups and adopt behaviors seen from those in the same social setting.  Similarly,  popular  online  challenges  have  been  effective  at  influencing  younger  generations  and  can  be  a  powerful  form  of  setting  an  example.

Drawing from theories in evolutionary psychology, there are parallels to setting an example and how animals such as wolves act in a pack. 
Setting  an  example  is  an  effective  way  to  influence  those  around  us. Examples can be very persuasive and prove that such behavior is possible.  This  trend  has  swept  classrooms  and  has  made  e-cigarettes  seem  like  the  norm;  in  studies,  researchers  have  found  the  direct  correlation  between  seeing  peers  use  e-cigarettes  and  developing  the  habit  oneself. A pack of wolves often looks to one or two members to set an example and guide them. Whether it be through trends such as “Juuling” or through setting a standard of excellence, setting an example can be an impactful way to shape the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors of those around us.. 

Setting an example is the best method of influencing individuals.  For  example,  the  recent  phenomenon  of  “Juuling”  has  demonstrated  the  power  of  setting  an  example",1
"Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace.

Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you don't have people around you to stop you or distract you. They say some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. In this case being abble to attend school at home helps a lot of students.

Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people, One of my favorite soccer player once said that ""the only thing that attending school at home does not help is at socializing, meeting new people."" that's of the reason not a lot people attend school at home, because they like to meet new friends, being together with people that you like.

Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, you can focus more and you is a option that you can take if you have any obstacle in your way at school such as bullying or something like that, nowadays is more common to see people taking online classes. One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudn't because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. I had a problem at freshman year that i've got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didn't knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudn't have to face this problem every school day. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. All the schools should have online classes that you can take at home so every student can study the way they want to study;Therefore, students benefit by being able to attend classes at home.. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades.

One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we can't change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home",0
"We can't have a good result, if we'll be lazy, and inactivity doing, learning something. It'll make everything easier. Good habit also help you create a good process.

An active process creates the positive success. So working hard, and always doing something is the key to open the successful gate.

In the road of the success, it would never had a footprints of lazy people. Restaurant would not able to serve a delicious meal, if they didn't have a good preparation. In the road of the success, it would never had a footprint of lazy people. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."".. An active process creates a the positive success, and in the road of the success, it would never had a footprints of lazy people.

We'll create a good habit and accomplish more, if we are always actively focusing and doing something. We should not feel enough for something, that'll be a reason make us become lazy. I agree with that. With the good habit, we always feel good and comfortable to study, learn, and do everything. We are the same. Nobody could be a good doctor, a good architecture, or anything good think, unless they tried hard and focused. We accomplish more if we are always doing something. So we should work hard every time, and we should not think:"" Inactivity would serve a purpose"".

We should work hard to get and good process, and the good process'll create success. Never enough for something. People,who are always doing something will get a good habit. Nobody want to hire or work with a lazy people, because they have none, they can't make a good result. Especially the way people look at you will be changed to positive and respect",0
"These initiatives include installing low-flow fixtures in sinks and toilets, building student awareness of energy and water conservation through educational campaigns, and encouraging campus recycling efforts. This could be managed through a survey that gauges the opinion of the school community and through a series of informational meetings to discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed extension. . 

The school board may also raise the issue of extending the school day by two hours, which could lead to conflict between students, teachers, and board members. 

In order to present these initiatives to the school board, I would recommend creating a proposal that outlines the goals of each project and campaign, the benefits of conservation, and a description of how each can be implemented and maintained. 
After researching various ways to conserve energy and resources in schools, I've identified several possible projects and campaigns that can be implemented",1
"Here are the reasons why you should its a great thing to graduate out of school because you can be done with school you can join any educational if you want and you would be proud of your self.

Also you need to pass most of your class's in order to graduate for high school or anything like that. Then i would be actually be proud of my self that i graduated from school and saw that i finished school and yes it is important to graduate because its a important thing that you have done in your life.

Also you can get any jobs you like if you graduate and take education and finish school. And there is more reasons why you should graduate but those are the mains ones for me its like my own Opinion i dont know about what other's think about you just need to take education in order to have a good career or get a good job if you want.

Also graduateing can show you that you learned new subjects and you passed them and you feel great about your self when you do those new things.. You can also go to university and get your bachelor degree if you really want to but first you need to get your high school diploma and graduate from anything in college.

After all of that you can do any career you want because you graduated from mostly everything and thats why its important to graduate. Would you like to graduate? if so you should. I would like to graduate because its' important to me and you need to be graduated to work in certain jobs",0
"So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do",0
"This can result in low levels of engagement, and may lead to poor learning outcomes. Furthermore, there is an increased possibility that students may cheat on tests or quizzes when not supervised by teachers. However, when adapted properly, remote learning can be an effective method of teaching that can benefit both teachers and students.

The potential of students dropping out of school while learning from home is also a concern. 

All in all, while there are risk associated with distance learning, there are also many positive aspects, such as enhanced access to education for students who may otherwise struggle to attend school. 
Distance learning has become a popular option for many students, and with it, certain risks and benefits arise. With the right strategies in place, distance learning can be a safe and beneficial educational system.. Governance must be implemented to ensure distance learning is effective but not abused. To counteract this, teachers must find innovative solutions to ensure that students do not take advantage of online learning.

Distance learning can also have an impact on teachers' jobs, as they may feel overworked or lack the freedom to instruct classes in their usual manner. Without regular attendance or in-person supervision, more students may remain long-term absent from school, impeding their learning progress. While remote learning can offer an accessible and flexible learning experience, it can also have adverse effects on student attendance and cheating. 

When it comes to attendance, many students may find themselves less inclined to actively participate in classes due to lack of in-person interaction",1
"When I come to my class my friend start saying ""Xin Chao"" it means ""Hello"" in English, I'm so glad that they love and want to learn it. People are love challenges and learn new languages. There are 67 languages have spoken in the world, 8.9% of us speak Vietnamese. Don't you think it would be helpful for your parents when you 're on a family vacation. I can do a lot of things with Vietnamese, such as translate English to Vietnamese, teach my friends how to speak Vietnamese and to communicate with others Vietnamese.

I can speak both Vietnamese and English at the same time, so that's mean I could translate from English to Vietnamese or even Vietnamese to English. I had a friend who is American, I taught him how to speak Vietnamese, and now he can speak Vietnamese like his home language.

However it would be helpful if you are in Vietnam or a place where the most Vietnamese people lives, you could ask them in Vietnamese when you need help( I bet if you are from a foreign country and you can speak Vietnamese, they will think you're super cool). It would help you a lot if you want to visit Vietnam one day.. Vietnamese is on top 10 hardest language has spoken. I remember that one time, I had a family reunion and I went to Vietnam. Then I was lost, I tried yell ""Help me, I lost, I can't find my parent"", but they couldn't understand what I was said, luckily I can speak Vietnamese, I asked them where is the police station so I could find my parents.

Overall, Vietnamese is the perfect language to learn if you want to challenge yourself. That is my main job whenever I go out with my mom, because she doesn't speak English or able to understand it.

My friends are love Vietnamese, they always convince me to teach them this amazing language. My skill is can speak Vietnamese fluently",0
"When my brother was in 12th grade he wanted to go personaly to the colleges but he said some of them were too far and that he didnt want to go because he needed to do something really important and so what he did was that he went online and started applying for 5 colleges and he got accepted to 4 of them. Technology is not for only buying or doing any other things it's for doing projects in class or a if your doing your homework, applying for jobs, and applying for college. There are better chances that you get many things done and also you get the chance to have some time off of looking and talking to people. Also when you have test it's mostly technology because you don't really have test on paper anymore now it's on laptops and you don't have to write anything now it's only typed it is really easy and fast. ""It's better technology instead of talking to people"".. At the same time even tho your not going out if you shop online there is a posibility that your clothes that you ordered does not fit you or it might not come on time when you really need it. Having to fill papers with people takes up so much time that you will be there the whole day instead of you doing it online at home and not having to rush up anything and if you mess up the laptop tells you that there is something that you typed up is wrong.

Second, If you don't feel like going to the store because your just tired and you just don't want to go out but you need some clothes for that night and you don't have any then what you can do is go online and start shopping there and buy everything you need for that night and you will be fine with out the need of going to the mall or going to any other store. I didn't even have to go ask him for help or anything. When you ask your teachers what they would say is that go on your laptop and look it up and then go ask your classmates if you can't find anything. There can be many positive effects on technology but theses 3 were mostly about how technology is even tho you do not interact with other humans face-to-face it is good doing online things. If I were to ask many people which side they prefer they would choose the positive effect side. They help you do a lot when you really need it. When you go to the stores sometimes you have to handle some workers that are aggressive and they have a bad attitude. I don't like seeing people with bad attitude it makes me mad and it always makes me just go away and not look at them anymore.

Third, In school sometimes you have projects and you have class work but you can't find information about your research or anything about your topic or about your class work then you have to find information online. For my US VA History project are teachers gave us many different websites that we can use and they were very helpful I got all my information from there. What you can do is that you can go on your laptop and go to the website and apply there and you can take your time on it and not have to worry about going there. The process of returing it and everythig is just too much. You can apply to many collleges online and that is really great so you can get accepted to many colleges out in other countries or states. That's why people prefer that it's better to go to the store and just buy it from there. Technology has positive effects on people's lives because they can help you with many information that your trying to look up for example if your trying to shop, play games, or even buy or read books. He said it was not even hard. Even essays it used to be essays on paper and now it's essays in laptops.

In conclusion, These were my 3 main reasons why technology has a positive effect on people's lives. Here are my 3 reasons why technology is positive for people's lives.

First, let's say that you want to go to college but you can't go to the college because you don't have time or maybe that you just can't go. If that was me I would prefer to go to the mall or the store to",0
"you should other people for help.

you can help you pick the right choices. So then you ask for some advice from family and friends. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. Because you have gotten so much fact and options you can finish faster.

All Am saying is ask for some help and you can get the right answers and you can probably make some friends too. So then you ask for more advice. like for example you are doing some hard work at school and you want the right answer you are not just going to ask one person you are probably going to ask more then one person. But if you do ask a lot of people you can probably can get confused. But you still don't know what to do. And maybe get mad and not finish your work. All really because everybody thinks different. But all so all the opinion you got can help you a long way. It's all ways good to get more info on your topic because you don't ever want to do something with out any knoallige.

People can help you answer stuff faster. you can probably can get the answer faster by telling more then one person. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. Then at last you all ready know what to do.  . Last of all it's better to ask more people because like I said you can get more knoallige on the topic and will help you one making the better choices as will. Then you will have no clue how to being aging. So you can more. You can ask some friends or family for some help then it can help you go the right way. I think u should ask for more help and advice. so you can pick the better choices.

You can get more info on the topic you are doing. And last of all ask more then one person can probably get you the right answer. Imagine you are going to buy some new shoes but you don't know if you should get them. Thats how you can get some more info",0
"This makes the contentious question of whether cell phones should be allowed in the classroom an exceptionally delicate matter. In addition, allowing cell phone use could open up a potential safety risk. From social media to games, these devices have revolutionized the way we communicate and interact in today's world. With a proper understanding of the risks and rewards associated with allowing cell phone use in the classroom, teachers and administrators can make a decision that is best suited to the learning environment of their students.. Teachers and students alike should be aware of the potential consequences that could arise from allowing cell phones in the classroom, and be proactive in creating rules and procedures to prevent these issues from occurring. Even with appropriate warnings, one student on their phone could quickly turn into a whole class of students with their eyes glued to their screens. In addition, some students may have audio or visual impairments that can be aided by technology.

However, there are drawbacks to allowing cell phone use in class. On the other hand, if used properly, cell phones can be powerful tools that can be used in the classroom to help students learn.

In order to make an informed decision about whether or not students should be allowed to use their cell phones during class, it is important to consider the pros and cons. On one hand, students that are allowed to use their cell phones during class may be distracted by social media, text messages, and other digital content. One of the primary benefits of allowing cell phones in the classroom is that students can use them to enhance their learning experiences. The classroom is meant to be a learning environment, not one for inappropriate content or malicious actors.

Despite these drawbacks, allowing students to use their cell phones in class can still be beneficial. 
Cell phones have become ubiquitous in our digital age. For example, students can use their phones to research topics, watch educational videos, and take notes. As mentioned, cell phones can be extremely distracting for some students",1
"Students needs a lot of stuff to success in life. Plus Not working alone, I do not like to work alone in life. It allow students to explore certain professions. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. . Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and it's the most important thing in a partnership business.

A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. It's not only sharing the risks, but sharing the good stuff too. Taking the risk alone is very hard, It's as hard as touching the clouds. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. Schools should have the qualities to help their students success.

Schools should have a partnership business to help all the students to reach their goals. Many schools have partnerships with local companies. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. Having all the risk alone is horrible, for an example it can causes living in the street or losing all the money that the person have. Schools should have the qualities to help the students success in their future life. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. I don't want to lose all my money so I would be happy to have a partnership member to help me out. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and

No one takes the risk alone. It will help students to improve their skills. Sharing ideas to make the profit better. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness.

Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Having a partnership is much easier, because members helps when its needed.

Partnership is easier, because if the business doesn't work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. I would love to work with other people when I grow up.

Sharing Is one thing I like about partnership. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Helping the students to improve their skills and give them time to improve their brains as well. I want to live a good life when I grow up , so I won't like to take all the risk by myself. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Sharing money to grow the business",0
"An enjoyable educational activity.

I think that a enjoyable activity for education wiil be a game y math like work in a group of 3 to 5 persons each person in the group to to answer a question, if they get the question right they get a point but if they don't they don't get any point, the group with more points get some candys for they exelent job doing what they are hate to do.

I think this a perfect activity because kids like to compete each other and is better when they know that if they win they get some candys.

Another enjoyable activity will be in science, doing a project of how animals live what thay ate and how they survive to the other animalto and give some importants facts to the teacher ,

i think this project may be of two persons because a think this will be to easy for them and there may be some student doing the project by them self.

I think that will like the project because they can get to know about an animal life and importants stuff about it and they can have fun with friends.

I choose math and science because this are my favorites subjects and i enjoy doing them with my friends and my teachers my favorite part is when we get to work in group that is in science, but in math my favorite part is when i get a question right some time the teacher give me some candys. ",0
"This could lead to a better choice than what might be derived from a single opinion. With a broad range of experiences and perspectives, gathering advice from multiple people is a tool with great potential to help someone make more thoughtful and sound decisions that can have a lasting and positive impact.. 
Asking multiple people for advice can be a beneficial decision-making strategy. Furthermore, by listening to a variety of counsel, one may be exposed to new ideas and solutions to a problem, reaffirming convictions or allowing for a more personalized solution. In addition, this individual can learn how to analyze a situation from multiple points of view, allowing this person to make more informed choices beyond the dilemma in question. 
       
Overall, seeking advice from different people can be an invaluable asset that can help someone greatly in life, both in the short-term and long-term.  

This method can also provide an individual with a more in-depth understanding of the situation, as each party usually provides their personal perspective that can contextually provide more information. By doing this, one can gain perspectives from a more diverse range of sources, allowing for a more balanced and informed decision",1
"Have you ever thought of a place in the world you would like to visit? Some people would go to France to see the popular Eiffel Tower; while others would go to Hawaii just to relax. For me however, I would like to visit Generic_City because the people there are well mannered and kind. For instance, when visiting the waterfalls at night, it is very colorful which makes it beautiful to watch. . And Also because there are outstanding waterfalls and parks. Furthermore, most of the people in Dubai make a honest living and there is rarely any crimes caused by residents.

Additionally, there are amazing waterfalls and parks because the designs and structures are well made and created. And something I would like to do once I arrive, is to greet these grateful and thankful people because they are gentle to one another. And also because there are amazing waterfalls and parks.

To begin with, the people there are well mannered and kind because they treat each other like brothers and sisters instead of mortal enemies. Also, something I would like to do when I arrive, is to go on a boat ride because it is very peaceful and it make you feel calm as the ride goes along.

In conclusion, a place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City because the people there are well disciplined and nice",0
"Furthermore, it gives the individual the flexibility and autonomy to prioritize tasks and manage their own pacing. Both methods can benefit productivity and high-quality results if they are approached and executed effectively.. This is important for those moments when deep and vigorous contemplation is needed to solve complex or unique problems. 

Ultimately, whether you decide to work in a group or alone depends on the task at hand and the individual's preferences. 

On the other hand, working alone also has its perks. Additionally, working in a group can reduce stress for the members as it ensures everyone has accountability and support from one another along the way. Working in a group can provide a great opportunity for collaboration, as multiple individuals come together to brainstorm ideas, openly discuss different options, and share their unique perspectives. It allows for uninterrupted concentration, uninterrupted focus, and no distractions from direct collaboration with other people. 
When it comes to working in a group versus working alone, there are both advantages and disadvantages to consider. This makes it possible to generate more creative and innovative solutions to tackle challenging projects",1
"In conclusion, setting an example has the potential to be both positive and negative, so it is important to consider both sides before engaging in this type of behavior.. Two advantages associated with setting an example are fostering a more obedient and disciplined environment, and inspiring others to strive for the goals you have achieved. One main disadvantage to setting an example is that others may see you as arrogant, creating tension and mistrust. 
After researching, I found that setting an example by your own behavior to influence other people can be both an advantage and a disadvantage",1

"Those without the knowledge of technology may be at a significant disadvantage in their day-to-day lives. The role of education is essential in discovering the potential benefits of modern technology. However, technology can be used for much more than just communication- it can make lives easier and allow us to reach new connections, even allowing those who would otherwise not be able to, to interact and share ideas. Through the advances of technology, it has become easier to stay in contact with others, no matter the distance. Ultimately, technologies can be used for great benefit if used for the right purposes.. 
The development of technology has made a profound impact on the way humans communicate and interact with one another",1
"
This summer, I had the privilege of visiting a small village in South America. I was equally astonished by the intricate designs the potters were able to create. Observing the dedication of the potters in the village and the joy in their faces when they were able to produce a successful pot, taught me that there is pleasure in working carefully and patiently and that you don’t have to be wealthy to be content. This experience has certainly changed me and I hope to take this lesson with me wherever life takes me.. It also showed me that even with so few resources, one can still create something of beauty. Although I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of activities while there, one of the most memorable experiences was learning how to make traditional pottery. 

The process, which involved mixing clay with water and collecting materials from the local environment, taught me the value of craftsmanship and taking pride in one’s work. I was amazed to discover how much time, hard work and patience goes into making just one pot",1
"It is important to remember that one should always remain true to themselves and have faith in their abilities and dreams; the only way to succeed is to forge your own path. As long as you stay true to yourself, empowering change can be made.. Reach out for support from friends and family and practice mindfulness and positive self-talk. 

Remaining resilient during difficult times is a key component to maintaining one’s individual identity. Discrimination can breed feelings of inferiority that can be difficult to bear. It is helpful to think about the positive aspects of any situation, no matter how dire it may seem. Find ways to be creative and express yourself authentically. Following beliefs and opinions that conflict with our own can create feelings of guilt, anger, and resentment. 
It is easy to get caught up in the expectations of others",1
"Students may have different plans for there future and want to work on what they want to do. Doing an extra activity may cause students to panic with a lot of work to do.

Another reason I disagree that all student must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may not like that there is a lot of activity they have to choose from. Some students want to focus on graduating school.

It also may cause problems on most students. Many students don't like to do activity with other people around them and going with what the teacher wants them to do.. Most students like to do things on there own or at home on there bed or personal space. Students want to do less work at a time. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may have other plans or don't want to do an extra activity",0
"With the right support structures in place, online courses can be a valid and successful educational option for students.. It's also important for teachers to remain available to answer students' questions and provide assistance when needed.

In conclusion, while online classes offer many advantages, there are some potential problems that can be avoided or minimized with the right planning and implementation. Furthermore, online classes often allow for more flexible pacing, allowing students to work at their own speed.

However, there are some drawbacks to taking online classes too. The lack of in-person interaction with a teacher and other students can lead to feelings of isolation. Also, traditional classroom settings usually provide a structure and organization that can be more difficult to achieve in an online class. Technical issues such as internet connection and compatibility with the courseware can cause frustration for students as well.

To address these issues, online courses should provide a robust discussion forum and interactive elements such as live video sessions or quizzes. 
One of the major advantages to taking an online class is the convenience it provides to students. They don't have to worry about commuting to class each day, or having their schedules interrupted by classes",1
"With the rise of the digital age, individuals and society have been able to benefit from advances in technology in a variety of ways. It has also enabled them to save time and money and make purchases from the comfort of their own homes. Similarly, online shopping has given people access to a wider variety of goods than ever before. Online job applications have enabled people to more easily search for and apply to desired job openings. All in all, technology has had an undeniable positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole.. 
Technology has revolutionized the way we live and interact. Cell phones, emails, and video conferencing have allowed people to stay connected with each other, no matter where they are located. Another advantage of technology is its ability to facilitate communication",1
"Identifying a career at a young age.

Identifying a career at a young age may be difficult for some students ,most of them think different ,some of them doesn't even care about their future or what they are going to do with their life ,parents may think this is a good idea because they want a good life and good future for their childrens and want them to be successfull and this will change their perspective of thinking.

Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think i'm already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I don't need to go school again just to spend money ,I'm good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didn't talk to him about careers when he was at school.

One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,that's why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career.

Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids I'm not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didn't have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didn't have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesn't have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work

In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.",0
"Judgment and discrimination can be damaging to society, leading to feelings of insecurity, unfairness, and distress. It is through self-belief and convictions that people can have the assurance to be able to reach for their aspirations, as well as create a more amicable and unified world. 
Respecting all people regardless of their color, nationality, and beliefs has the potential to shape a better future for us all.

Consider consulting with close family members, trusted friends, or knowledgeable mentors.

Additionally, you can also reach out to peers or colleagues, perhaps in the same industry or who simply share the same values and interests.

"
First impressions are a funny thing – they often stick with us and have a huge impact on how we perceive someone. It is only through understanding and patience that can we learn more about an individual and their character. We may think someone intelligent based on their manner of speaking in an interview, but that does not tell us the full range of their knowledge. Our beliefs and opinions can shift, and it is important to recognise this when judging someone. We must take the time to get to know someone properly and keep an open mind if we want to gain a full understanding of their character. It is only by taking the time to get to know someone through meaningful conversations, spending quality time with them, and learning more about their background that we can gain a better understanding of who they are.

It is also important to remember that we all have the capacity to grow and change over time. Everyone has the right for their character to be judged on its own merits and not by a few fleeting moments.

First impressions are based on a limited scope of facts and can often be heavily biased. We may think that a person is unkind based on a lack of politeness in an introduction, but it does not give us a full understanding of their true character. 

In conclusion, it is impossible to judge someone based on their first impressions. We must understand that nobody is perfect and that we all make mistakes. However, it is important to remember that first impressions can be wrong, and it is not possible to judge someone's character based on the few limited points of view we have of them early on. Everyone deserves the right to be judged on their own merits and given a fair chance to prove themselves.",1
"So I think that the success is good for us because the success make us better. I agree with Bristish Prime Misnister Winston Churchill. the final of semester Generic_Name recover science class, Generic_Name had a success because Generic_Name study a lot to recover science class and Generic_Name doesn't loss the hope to recover science class. If you have mistake in your life just learn about it because that help you to don't do it agian the same mistake. My concluison is The life is amazing and maybe in the future we can have fails or we can have success but the most important is that you learn abour yours mistake and yours failure because that helps you to be a better person in the community and the socity and in your life.. I believe that my failure that I had before that help me to be a better person to learn more to do thinks that I don't believe that i can do and the thing that a have is thanks of my success that I had it. The failure comes before of success So, I think that everybody had a failure in their lives but I think that is good because we are learning about our failure and I think that the failure is important becuse with the our failures we can be a better people for the socity or community. I think like Generic_Name goes to university and fail science class, Generic_Name had a failure but he can think about it what happen or that is wrong in science class and then, Generic_Name study a lot for recover science class. I think if you have a lot success it is because you are donig well",0
"And that's why i think they are the best . And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . . One activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . And what was supposed to happen was that i would be able to see the waves which light travels on . One of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school . And until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself .

After that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . Beacause they teach you in a more directs type of learning . And after the teacher explained the process of how this happens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest i didn't see anything i was kind of dissapointed . And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is . But it was defenently a lot of fun .

Another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . And what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . But one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we human's do . Because they make class a little more interesting . And it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it did'nt smell good either . And that part definently disgusted me but it didn't made me want to stop either.

After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . But there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frog's stomach . But wen he poke it , it resulted that the frog's eye was'nt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . Unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frog's interior . Fortunently it did'nt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . But it had some downs like it was really short and the teacher took forever to explain the process . But i still think it was a really interesting project .

And what i tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that . Frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasn't as amazing and funny as the other project . Science experiments are not always boring and you may not like them but you should give them a chance . But after four seconds i could see them and they were kind off hard to see and it was for some few seconds but i actually enjoyed the project . But it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . Or maybe they removed some of them but there wasn't a lot of organs in there

And another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . But one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frog's eye ",0
"Additionally, students in after school activities often benefit from close relationships with mentors and coaches and have the potential to be part of a team. On the positive side, a student is able to work independently and in a familiar environment, where they may feel more comfortable and secure. However, after school activities can also have disadvantages. 
After school activities offer advantages such as providing an engaging environment with a sense of camaraderie, fostering the development of important social skills, and enhancing physical health. Additionally, the lack of peer interactions and motivation in an unstructured setting can lead to a student becoming easily distracted.. 

Doing homework at home has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, students may be exposed to activities that are not consistent with school values and beliefs, and the amount of time devoted to such activities may interfere with the student’s ability to complete their homework in a timely manner. On the other hand, it can be hard to remain focused and stay on task without the structure and support of an after school program",1
"If you choose to hang out with people that aren't good for your health and mindset then they aren't people to stick around with. Teens are able to say no but they choose they wrong road. Teens are able to say no to bad things that want to come into their lives and everyone kids,adults and teens have their voice and mind to say no and be a good person. Either then teens living in good home conditions they end up going to collage and having a good life. ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" said John Lubbock, therefore you control what you do, who you hang out with but sometimes the environment around will say otherwise

Everyone has a voice one way or the other and is able to control what they do. Every time a teen even thinks about skipping it's bad character. Teens knowing this still choose to skip. According to Generic_Name article teens living in bad conditions can create bad characters when they grow up. "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it'. They lose that control of thinking for themselves. It has been proven that mom's all around the world are able to point out whose a true friend that cares for you and who isn't.

You have control on what do you or even think. Teens everywhere can decade on what they do with their lives no matter where you live you can overcome it and be someone great in life.

People are able to choose what they do in life, what they think and who to surround them self with. Teen at Generic_School choose to skip class all the time , knowing they'll end up in trouble says Generic_Name in her article. Having a good mindset and working hard shows good character. Being mature and well behaved at school is good character. Teens living in places that are broken down that aren't healthy living condition often end up in gangs and dropping out of school. Control

What you do in your life is your choice, you could choose to become a doctor, a teacher or an artist. Every teen has control of what they do at school.

Others may say that the environment around you is what you show in yourself. Wherever you come from you choose yourself to have a good character or not. Looking after yourself is better than winding up somewhere you shouldn't be with the people you shouldn't be with. . Scientist have done test and have seen that 50% of teens smoke because their friends smoke so they can fit in",0
"Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.         . Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time",0
"We become stronger and better conditioned. 
The wealth of benefits accompanying an active lifestyle and spending time outdoors is well-documented. 

Furthermore, limiting our technology usage creates an opportunity for families to become closer. From strengthened muscles to an increased ability to cope with stress, participating in sports offers tremendous benefits to our health. 

In conclusion, it is clear that healthy physical activities and spending time away from technology are necessary for the overall well-being of our bodies and our minds. The quality time spent together outside in nature increases a sense of well-being and can foster healthier relationships. Through physical activities such as walking, climbing, swimming, or playing sports, our bodies are provided with an opportunity to move and to breathe. Our mental state is also improved. Without the distraction of games, screens, and social media, family members can focus more on one another and create more meaningful connections. To promote a stronger family life, individuals and families should incorporate healthy physical activities into their lifestyles and limit their tech usage to build deeper relationships.",1
"Furthermore, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals.

In conclusion, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. In The Castle Standard each have their own class their, the bottom league is the beginner class, the middle is the amateur class, and the highest class is The Hall of Fame class AKA HOFC. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal. In the end he got higher paid he was of the greatest CEO in the company and he was able to get a new house for him and his son. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence.

Secondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. In a everybody lives or in today's era, everyone wants to achieve greatness, but by achieving greatness people often or need to start from the bottom of their league or what I like to call ""THE CASTLE STANDARD"".    . Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals.

Firstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. I believe that people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination.

Lastly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. because he solved the companies huge problem which almost led the company to bankrupt, so the authorities decided to keep him in the company and give him promotion and a huge check to be able to sustain his daily life with his son. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce. In people mindset have something they want like, saving up money to buy an expensive item or staying on task to get a promotion at your work place. For example, there was a movie called The Pursue of Happiness, the people in the movie was Will Smith and his son. He went to work even though he was homeless. In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company. The movie was about how a man, who worked at a business company as a mere employee, he and his son was kicked out of the apartment and they were homeless, they were trying to find a new home, so they started to live in a homeless shelter, but that didnt stop Will Smith from going to work. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. Also by stating you rmind on what you want to do people can make remarkable or impossible things that might shocked the world. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. In activity does serve a purpose by showing maturity; however, people accomplish more if we are doing something. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. There also shows determination when they are trying to reach their goals in what they want to become in their future. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life",0
"On the other hand, adopting a four day school week could help reduce the amount of energy needed to transport students, as fewer buses and cars would be necessary. However, a shorter school week could mean that students would have less time to learn in class, potentially leading to a disruption in their academic progress.. On one hand, extending school days means that a school can do more to conserve energy as they can turn off certain lights or air conditioners earlier each day. This would in turn reduce emissions and the amount of energy needed for those transport vehicles. Furthermore, it could give students more time to practice energy conservation habits such as recycling, reducing water usage, and the unplugging of electronics when not in use. 
Extending school days or adopting a four day school week can be a viable way for schools to promote conserving energy and resources",1
"It means we have to change our face mask everyday to be a head of somebody. This can also solve our conflicts , helps us to accomplish our goals and to be live in any environment. Giving up is the beget enemy in their life. Just to respect for my community, i celebrate thanks giving with fake smile with others just to create a good environment in my area.

In my conclusion , sometimes we should be somebody else to live in our divided society. every living matter have their own characters and identity. It means life push us to open our doors and see different people quality and life style. Sometimes I have to act like American just to establish a good environment around me. Thanksgiving is a well know holly day in American culture . This is leading us to conflicts and fights in every aspects. focusing is one of the beast way a person use it to be on the top of everybody. you have to switch up to get to your dreams ( to being number one fighter). For example, If your goal is to be number one fighter, you have to fight first. For example, we can see a political conflict between Donald Tranp and the Democrat. thats the reality. American secrete service agents go to Afghanistan to catch terrorist. Being somebody else help them to achieve there goals.

I believe, becoming somebody else, can help you to learn about that someone personality.

This can help you to adapt the behavior of that person, witch can help you to establish a good relationship. Naturally, we have to associate our self with others, to manage our way of living. If you want to be a fighter you have to fight. I believe we have to be logic and see the other side. Plants, they can't move but we can. You can't love some one and punch them in the face at the time. Emerson's statement "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" In my opinion, this is wrong.                . strong person fight to win and to be number one no matter what the situation is. our world is different. For example, I am originally from Ethiopia living in the US. It will help to avoid conflicts between me and my community.

Every strong person uses methods to accomplish their drams and goals. Even if you have a lover personality. Personally I don,t agree with Donald Tranp's ideas and terms. The World We Live in

More than 4 billion people with different culture,different background and different mentality live in our planet Earth; and each person have their own way of life style. But we dont celebrate it in Ethiopia. Sometimes, we have to allow our self and live other people lives. Not being somebody else cannot be the reason to give up in a dream. this will help us to avoid conflicts, to accomplish our personal goals and to live in any environment.

Sometimes, I fell like we should change the name "" world "" to "" different."" It explain the meaning a lot more. This could be the smartest way to live our life with our crazy the society . This can show us how our world is divided in many ways. Birds can fly but lions can't. But if my community agrees and supports Tranp's ideas, It is mush easier if I put a new a mask in my face and put a fake smile on top of it and pertained that i am on same track like them witch is supporting Donald Tranp. They are not Muslims but they have to dress up like Muslim and learn their language and culture just to make their country safe from terrorist",0
"Even if my life is the worse one I going to take care of all my decesions sometimes we can ask at someone for a opinion maybe, because the person is more older then me but is only a opinion you're not gaving authorities at all at the person to go and make your decisions and then take care of all your stuff.

In my conclusion is better if you take care of your on stuff doesn't matter how hard that it, is your life and you are the only one that knows how to deal with everything that you have done so, this is my last decision people should make their own decisions. . This prompt is about some people that need help to make their own decisions or need someone to told what they need to do even in their personal life.

The question say "" should people make their omn decesions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?"" some people they will said that is better if someone as came and make there decisions in everything so, they don't need to worry about anything.

There are another person that think that is way to much because how someone that they don't know is gonna make their decisions and also the dicisions of their life.

This is a big topical because like I said before so many people can desagree with this but there are other that are agree with this,in my opinion I'm desagree with this becuause is my life and I need to leard how to deal with it",0
"
Everyone has unique passions, skills, and dreams, which can be difficult to pursue if you are not truly being yourself. Through being true to your authentic self, oftentimes you can unlock the greatest accomplishments that you are capable of achieving. 

For example, consider Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, two of the most famous entrepreneurs of all-time. 

From these examples, it is clear that the ability to be yourself can lead to great accomplishments. By staying true to what her music was meant to represent, she ended up becoming one of the most successful musicians of all-time. Their passion turned into ambition, which allowed them to eventually revolutionize how the world views technology today. These examples show that by understanding your truest passions and aspirations and believing in them wholeheartedly, you can discover your own greatest accomplishments.. It is often said that the phrase ""be yourself"" has become cliché, but in short, it is incredibly powerful. In another example, the popular country music artist Taylor Swift found her success by writing honest songs that people could relate to. Both individuals followed their instinct and pursued what they were passionate about",1
"I could do more. On that time,my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow,it makes them feel good,and make their live easier.

However,not everybody agree with position,some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they don't want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. In the whole,Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement was true based of the reasons.. Further more, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live.

In addition,it makes us feel good. Ralph Waldo Emerson says""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow.""On one hand,some people disagree with statement. Moreover,we should get out of our comfort zone so we could have an easy live.

Based on this argument,one must conclude,people never get better unless they try new things in live. To illustrate,if someone be so strike in live and doesn't wants to try something beyond what he/she already mastered,that person will have a hard live. On the other hand,some people agree with this statement. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. One day we went swimming,everyone had fun except my cousin. Nevertheless,this opposition other important,namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For instance,my cousin was always sad and she hated to try new things. After condensing her for a long time,she try it. For example,my biggest fear in live is airplanes and i never been on it,but if i try it for the first time in my live even i scare or not next time,i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and i try it. Thus,people should try new things to make them feel good and happy.

Finally,it makes the live easy",0
"Furthermore, this practice may lead to greater levels of stress and anxiety for students as they are expected to perform in an unfamiliar area without having chosen it for themselves. 
Excerpt: 

When schools choose students' careers for them before they reach the age of making the choice themselves, the impact on the students can be far-reaching and profound. Ultimately, when schools control students' careers, it can prevent them from fully expressing their own individuality and achieving their full potential.. This can lead to decreased engagement in their academic pursuits, feelings of powerlessness and insecurity, and impair their ability to explore interests that may lie outside of the predetermined options. Without the opportunity to make a decision of their own free will, teenagers will have limited control over their own future",1

"She was a single mother living off of welfare when she began writing the Harry Potter series, only for it to become one of the highest-grossing franchises in history. Rowling, for instance. Looking at the people you know who have already achieved their dreams can provide some insight into what success requires and what it takes to reach your goals. Doing research, planning ahead, and staying motivated are all important steps for increasing the chances of success and getting closer to achieving your goals.. You may be able to land a good job, buy a new car, and even get your own house. All of these accomplishments require dedication, as well as a willingness to push yourself further. 
No matter the situation, hard work and dedication can help you achieve the goals you set for yourself. Many successful people have started out with seemingly limited resources, yet their relentless determination and ambition led them to reach great heights. 

The same is true for other areas of success – if you put in the effort to prepare yourself, you open yourself up to numerous opportunities. 

Whenever you’re feeling down or struggling to stay on track, remember that hard work can give you the life you desire. Take J.K",1
"Technology performs multi-tasks without physical contacts with others. Today one could stay at home and socialize with friends and family without physical contact. Again this brings us to the good part about social media, though kids may not have physical contacts with friends, they have the social media.

Big Thanks to technology, there might not be human contact but it is going to the positively change peoples lives. The world will be a better place.. Besides communication, people feel safer talking about their rights, the government and politics in general on social media than in public. Even though they don't make physical contact with friends, they are provided a better learning environment, less stressful activities, and the motivation to learn more and become a contribution to the society's well being which evryone today wants. But now they sit home and order anything, saving their health.

Secondly, technology has gone to the highest level. This is especially convenient for older ones because they are weak and stressing themselves could cause heart diseases and even death. Technology has provided social media apps making it easier to communicate without making human contact. Due to this, people don't have to go to stores to get groceries and other materials. In the United States, the limitation to human contact due to technology has had a positive effect on people's lives. In cases of emergency, social media has been proved to be the fastest way of saving lifes, accidents, and most importantly many deaths.

Obviously, technology has made it possible for kids who don't like school, and are poor learners at school due to the nature of the environment to learn online at home giving them another opportunity to become something great. in mordern times, technology has been very helpul to everyone",0

Spending time at a community park has abundant benefits, both for individuals and for the communities they come from. Exercise is also easily integrated into a park outing, whether it be walking, running, cycling, or playing sports. All in all, the benefits of community parks are undeniable.. For students, parks can also offer the perfect environment to get away from noisy and distracting environments, and to focus on completing school work in a peaceful, natural setting",1
"I believe it is important to share wisdom when it is needed the most. Wisdom can be gained from personal experiences and lessons, and is especially helpful when it comes to understanding and problem solving.

I have personally seen the power of wisdom in my life. Offering advice or a listening ear to those who are suffering can be immensely helpful. Wisdom can help someone during tough times and provide tools for managing difficult situations. Growing up, I was often faced with difficult experiences and conflicts that seemed insurmountable. Everyone has their own journey, and I believe it is important to be there to provide comfort and understanding when it is needed. It can be easy to give up when obstacles present themselves, but it's important to remember that things can always look up. With the help of wisdom, I was able to emerge from these hardships with a better understanding of the world and how to handle tough situations. 
Life can be a roller coaster, with moments of joy and despair. This wisdom has helped me to continue striving forward, even when the odds seem stacked against me.

An encouraging word or gesture can make all the difference to someone who is having a bad day. Sharing wisdom can be a great act of compassion and understanding, helping others to learn and grow from difficult experiences.. I learned to take a step back and view the situation as an observer, allowing me to more clearly see the solutions and paths around the problem",1

After school activities offer advantages such as providing an engaging environment with a sense of camaraderie, fostering the development of important social skills, and enhancing physical health. On the positive side, a student is able to work independently and in a familiar environment, where they may feel more comfortable and secure. However, after school activities can also have disadvantages. On the other hand, it can be hard to remain focused and stay on task without the structure and support of an after school program. Additionally, the lack of peer interactions and motivation in an unstructured setting can lead to a student becoming easily distracted.. Additionally, students in after school activities often benefit from close relationships with mentors and coaches and have the potential to be part of a team. For instance, students may be exposed to activities that are not consistent with school values and beliefs, and the amount of time devoted to such activities may interfere with the student’s ability to complete their homework in a timely manner. 

Doing homework at home has its own advantages and disadvantages",1
"In this word we accomplish more if we are always doing something outside or inside. If your not always doing something you can't learn and wont be able to accomish on what your goal is so never give up on what you want to acomlish set a goal for yourself. You might not do it right but once you do it and keep on repeating on what your are trying to accomlish. Also you keep on trying and you got it and you do it over you get better at it. If you fall get right back up again and keep on trying. If you keep on doing things over and over and you can't get it aventally you will find a way and get. So lets get up and always be doing something around this world.

I think if we always be doing something we accomplish it no matter what it is. You will probably learing all that by yourself until you get or you might go see a friend that knows all about building qnd he could teach you. We always get back up and keep on trying till we get it and once you get it you keep on doing it and you are really good at. After he teaches you your going to try and see what you learn. Always set a goal for yourself.

Everyone in this world always mistakes on what they are trying to accomplish but we always learn from our mistakes. Say you want to do something new that you never done before like building a bird house and you don't know anything about math, measuring or how to use the tooles. So lets get up and try new things.. You be abble to do things faster and eayier in life.

I think if you are always doing something in life we will always accomlish it even if it is really hard. There is always something we are doing even like simple stuff like watching tv, walking, working and etc... If we are not always doing something we don't really accomplish anything in life. Its like when you were a little kid you try to ride a bike you keep on doing it and try to get it to balance but every one in life falls but we always get back up again. Eventaily you will get it because you be praticing all day.

Also trying new things in life your always accomlishing it",0

Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized the importance of experiences and taking responsibility for one's work. He believed that if individuals take ownership of their job and dedicate themselves to it, they will be able to achieve their goals and become successful. 

Emerson's views on experiences and being responsible towards one’s job are significant and timeless. Emerson's emphasis on the importance of experiences and being responsible towards a job are important for individuals to achieve success.. 

Emerson further believed that taking responsibility for one's job is essential. He argued that individuals should take ownership of their performance and strive to better themselves and their work. He believed experiences are essential for gaining knowledge and wisdom, and encouraged individuals to take ownership of their successes and failures. He argued that one should learn from their experiences and use them to become a better person. Experiences can help individuals gain knowledge and wisdom and taking responsibility for one’s job allows them to become more confident, productive, and develop a sense of belonging within a profession. Furthermore, he believed being responsible towards one’s job allows individuals to create a sense of belonging and accomplishment",1

For teachers, this policy could mean lower stress levels and a more productive learning environment. For students, such a policy might provide an incentive to take their studies more seriously as there would be direct and immediate consequences for below-average grades. Not only would the teacher be able to focus on quality instruction rather than attempting to encourage a struggling student, but the other students would also be more engaged in their learning, encouraged by the absence of any disruption caused by a student with below-average grades.

Ultimately, by communicating the consequences of underperforming in their classes, a policy like this could be an effective tool for improving both student performance and overall school environment.. 
Implementing a policy where any student receiving a grade of less than a C in class would be excluded from participating in school activities could have several benefits for students and teachers alike. Additionally, it could offer a structure that encourages scholastic success, since those students who are motivated to achieve higher grades would be rewarded with chances to participate in school activities",1
"I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.

My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.

Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill.

I've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what i'm currently playing. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. She really enjoyed it. Everyone has a talent or skill. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.

My music skills have yet to improve, but until then I will continue trying new ways of music.. Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters' birthday. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. In my case, Its music",0
"He is attending one class online from his home. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.. She said yes. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. For example, my friend Generic_Name. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students",0

Another thing that why would should have on more half an hour is beacause we wake up early and have another half hour kicking ints not far if they want to do that they should a least change they school time and wake up like at 8am or something beacuase its not far wake up early and then leaving so late it should be the oppsite wake up late and leave school early it going to be better beacause then everybody going to kbe happeir no one is going to be in a bad mood and it's going to be chill and then .

Anothe thing way we should have an half an hour of school left it's beacause we the 8th grader we get lunch at 1:40 and then haveand half and hour of school were going to have lunch at 2:10 or something I arleadly hate that and i dont wanna be starving beacause then i wont to my work beacause how hungry I i'm going to get mad i'm going to get hangry and having busdriver taking the kid home at 6pm its going to suck beacause they need there time too for they could do stuff and have time with there family's and there going back and forth it sucks for them having ti puck up kids late and stuff and taking them home.. And if we make it longer there are going to be parent's that are going to be waiting for there child to take them to the football, soccer games and then when they come home its going to be late beacause like they want to change the hours they are not going to have enough time to do anything there going to go home to homework and then when you know it it arleady like 8pm and you have to go to bed. I think that it's a bad idea to put more hours of school beacause after school people,students and teachers have to do important stuff like take there kids to soccer or go to a doctors appointment and thats the only time that we have free to do are important missions and there are teacher's that live far they could live in Generic_City and other places that are far. so it's dummy hard work to get that on time. And we arleady wake up at 7am and then coming back home and it's like 5pm-6pm it's stress out kicking out stuff that you do but now you can't to beacause they put more time in School.

And i think it sucks beacause there are kids that go to my school that live in Generic_City and it take along time to come to school and go back home from school beacause i've lived in Generic_City before and it suck when i stay after school i get home like at 7pm-8pm and it's sucks so it better to not make school longer beacause there are kid that live pretty far and there are going to get home late and then they have to get there homework done too. And us as chidren its going to ruined are shecdule and are parent's to maybe we have not go to soccer or any activity that we take just beacause they put more time in school it going to suck being in a class room for 80 mintues now",0

Positive attitude is undoubtedly a key to success. It is no wonder that so many prominent figures throughout history have highlighted the importance of developing a positive outlook—including Benjamin Franklin, who famously said, “The Constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. 
Attitude is often described as “the lens through which we view the world.” Indeed, having a positive attitude can significantly improve our daily lives, from the way we approach the workplace to the way we handle relationships. You have to catch it yourself.” 

What makes a positive attitude the key to success is its role in personal motivation. For example, a study from the University of Michigan showed that students with a positive attitude about taking a tough math course achieved better results than students with negative attitudes, regardless of their level of intelligence or King’s College London tested the effect of “positive thinking” on athletes and found that successfully imagining the act of completing a task can increase motivation.

In our professional and personal lives, having a positive attitude can open the doors of opportunity. A positive attitude can show employers and colleagues the state of our mental health and resilience towards challenges, making it easier for us to take the steps towards a brighter future.. This is because positive thinking leads to optimism, which can improve quality of work, thus making us more appealing to employers or allowing us to achieve our goals. With resilience and conviction, any individual can develop the necessary skills and knowledge to become successful, but it is the attitude that makes them shine",1

"I think that students have reason of thougtht that is this is an achievement not is easy we have a achievement yes we have a achievement in this life because yes not have an achievement I do know that you thought in my opinion the trues is the point number firts in this life because that is really happened the true is import always me question for me is that yes not have true all away different.

Some things of this paragraph elieve o this prompt is that understand that the students they believe that students must be self confident and that sense have this world power CONFIDENT are two world confident and confidence Confident is feeling or showing that your are sure about your own abilities opcions and confidence is trust or stong belief in someone or something. I think that the life have must chance or opportunity of have one better life of enjoy every moment yes have work hard but always enjoy every minut every hour every every year with the family is important in this life not all only have that them job always think that have must time and to stop one moment and look this life will look the future.

What is an future? an future is at or to a greater distance in time more to a greater degree the board needs time to consider the matter futher. I think that are different peoples some person not look its future only think that the life them treat only of to live but not undertoond that not is only life. They have much confident and they have much order to learn more order is to tell someone to do something in a strong way which does not permit him to refuse and without saying they ordered to learn more learn is to get knowledge a skill they learning work they thounght that are the best.

They have achievenment something that is done successfully espeacially through hard work or skill. We took the precaution of locking our valuables in the things with safe like precautions against fire. They need considered that not are riks wastoo great to remember or pay attention to something the like the students is they have repect not are angry for no have experience in the job they are intelligent for no have insecurity is this I like not have insecure not are they have security Ilike they. I can't remember any futher back than 1995 at or to a greater distance in space. The act of finishing something successfully the feeling that you get when you have finished something sucessfully. However many people also use futher when talking about distances especially in formal coversation only futher can be used in other senses we need a futher week to finish the project but make your life no have self rich with only proffession make your future preofession a type of job that needs special training or skill especially one that needs a high level of education and yes have one occupation is always a job or profession always a employment is a work specially when it is done to earn money it's very difficult to find work at the moment.

I think that yes have a carrer like the student best effort but work I think that I can always but have a carrer the job or series of jobs that someone has in a particular are of work usually involving more resposibility as time passes I have a friend she had a very distingushed carrer in medicine she have a profession I do know because is different a prefession with carrer or trade I think that a trade is a hob always but specially one that involves working with your hands and requieres special training but now talking of the students I think that not have a job because thought that they not have a experience in a job.

I do know that must talking of this only think in the job and the student that the other people thought that they no have experience and that is esperience is to have somehing happen to you to feel something it was the firts time I had ever experenced failure and experinced is having the knowledge or skill that is necessary for something the true this student put in me an expiration because the point important this but they is the true they have a good point the sincerity the quality of being sincere or honest sincere used about a person really meaning or believing what you say not pretending sincerely in a way that shows what you really feel or think about someone or something.

The student's have praising like you say when you are expressing admiration for someone or somethig I think that they have a precaution always precaution in the job I think precaution is something that you do now in order to avoid danger or problems in the future. They in learning by lowering to move someone or something down to make something less in amount or quality. They believe that the source of true is self esteem is achevement. I have every confidence in ability to do the job. I take a positions on this issue I think that will look in the future. I think that some things that we thought not are true in the history the students they will work is not the best effort. The students I think that they thought in implore when you implore someone when the situation is very serious and you need something very much.

They had importance about the job the decision was of great importance to the future of the business they have importance of this job only person not have tolerance but learning other people what is tolerance is like to allow accept someone or something especially opinions or behavior that you do not agree with or people who are not like you and other word is intolerance the ability to suffer something especially pain difficukt conditions the student only working together but self better so that two or more things are mixed with joined.

The other people no have compassion they no are considerable with students I think that they had considerable difficullty in getting the students they have a opinion are work the important is the true they must consider the matter carefully before they make our choice to have something in my opinion I think about someone or something in a particular way",0
"Educational programs alredy have to take courses during the summer, if student don't finish important subjects. Does they will be study good? And, does they will need this program? They need time to finish their homework. Most of them don't have time to study good with four years education program.

Also, what about teachers? Does this subject will be intresting to students to study? Does they will have time to explain students, what they study? Teacher need some time to be ready for topic that give school to student. Each school study more that one hundred students. Making rool that student finish faster high school, must takes courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses, is not a good idea.

Most of our life need time. . Also need explane this on lesson and after lesson, if student don't undestand this on the lesson.

Nowbody, don't have extra time.

Of course some of school can make three year of education, but only some of school. Each our doing, need time and study too.

What about thoose who need extra time? What about imigrants, which needs extra time to their homework. Many students in high school took not much hard subjects, most of them are art and music . Hobby, learning, traveling, study in school. Educational program must be have extra time and be intresting to all students",0

"All those hater will always want to see you crying,mad, and sad and they also want you to feel like a big losser, all those haters turn them into your motivators, don't let them put you down. All the tears I have cried over him have build up strength on me and thought me to never give up and keep fighting even if it is hard for me.

Hard issues show you to not repeat the past and do better then the past. Those chances will not come back and you will regret not taking the chances. To never give up and show him and the haters that I am stronger and better.        . It has also showed me to never put a negitve thinking and put a positive thinking, because if you but a negitive thinking everything could come up negitive and you will always try to give up if everything comes out negitive. This has showed me when you try to give up you are showing yourselfs and others that you are weak and can't handel it. My hard problems have showed me to not repeat the past and to do better then the past because, I would always try to give up on everything and always put a negitive thinking to my problems. When my father was so mean to me I would always put my head up and not let the mean words get me down. When i cried because my mom was not with me and my father would not let me see her that showd me that my head was up all ready because I fighted to be with her. I can't lie I really miss him and I really wish I could give him a big hug. Always keep your head up high and never down because, keeping it down won't help at all.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. I took a chance to live with my mom and now I am happy with her.

Hard problems make you build up strength on yourself. I have turned all my haters into my motivators, because I wanted to show them that I can do it . Never feel bad that you showed the haters that you can do it. All that is left are the good memories I made with him. I will never forget him and will always love him beause he is my father. My problems opened up so many chances for me to do my best in life. Always put a positve thinking and everything will come out positive and you will feel motivated to keep fighting.

Really hard problems help you keep your head up and learn to never give up on a really hard war. Never lose that one chance in life. Always have a smile on you face, my mother told me ''even if you are upset always have a smile because, you have to smile to the hard world you are in."" That's why I agree that a problem is a chance for you to do your best. A problem Is a chance for you to do your best.

Did you know that problems are a chance for you to do your best.

Problems builds up strength on you. Hard times like problems help you to keep your head up and never give up on a hard war.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. When my father abandoned me and my sisters, it build up strength on me and my sisters because, we had to learn that are father is not always going to be there when we want him to be there and we have learned that we don't need a father for everthing and we can do it by ourselfs. Never give up of your problems, whatever problem you or your familly are going through never give up, because if you give up you won't be able to go to the past and change up everything that you gave up on. Stay strong and never forget that you are better, and stronger then that problem. They also show you to not repeat the past. They are also helpful for you in your life because, they make you strong, so when you have an other problem it won't hurt you as much. Problems will always have a chance for you, so you can do better in your life",0
"when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. so they should have a regualr schedual for te schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the studets as much. a year-around school benifits teachers not students. In my oppinon school is good how it is now. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a diffrence. What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks inbetween school days just so that they have months off on their summer break. having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldn't have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. and im an sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track.

"But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . . Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different . There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it . Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age.

I see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now?

Many people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. When I am older , I want to be at least a little happy with what I have my career as.

In the other sides opinion, I do see why committing to a career at a young age is pretty important too. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school. It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.

When students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future.

Students still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. But many might not go for that career in the future . They do not like going to work as much. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age. Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best",0
"At some point of a human being life they tend to join those who have bad taste in life and always make horrible decisions and by becoming a follower of those people they also become one of them slowly but surely with time.

We can decide to be ourselves to love who we are deeply in the inside and not care what others think of us in the outside. . God knew the second he decided us to be part of this world how our distinctive traits would be like when we become older, us loving ourselves influence others to do the same in there life.

In conclusion we we're not born to follow others we we're born to stand out for ourselves. There are two types of individual traits: the that pretend to be someone the're not and the one that stays true to who they are. We're form to have different types of personalities in ourselves which it is hard to understand others behavior toward us, we pretend to quickly think that we are in control or think we are in control of subtend things in life which we are not even in control of our own distinguishing traits.

"Online classes, i think that if students really trying to learn something is not need for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach al the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every class room, and i think that online classes are not a bad idea because they been teach by a computer and they have to pay attention or they will fail, but at school they wont fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and thats how they will pass classes better at school then online .

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",0
"Furthermore, online learners may miss out on the social aspect of physical classes and the networking opportunities that come with learning alongside others. For those juggling work and family commitments, distance learning offers flexible course schedules that allow them to attend classes as their schedules allow.  

For instance, a student enrolled in an online degree program may have difficulty forming relationships with professors, which can make it difficult to land internships or full-time job opportunities. In addition, a wider range of courses and materials can be accessed through online learning compared to a typical classroom setting.

However, there are some disadvantages to distance learning. Additionally, there is less direct contact between instructors and students, so it can be difficult to get feedback promptly.  All of these opportunities can help the student to expand their professional and personal networks.. Students must have reliable access to the internet and be proficient with technology to be successful. 
Distance learning has many advantages for students, as it allows them to save time and money by eliminating the need to attend physical classes. On the other hand, an on-campus student may be able to develop more meaningful connections with faculty, attend networking events, and participate in extracurricular activities",1

"What i think is it will be normal the effects like they will get use to it and they will mine they old busness plus to me they will say we gonna have to treat the younger students the same like everybody else . The older students are having bad grades in classes , their teacher will get a student who is really smart to be the older student twoder.. Their is no reason what will their reaction be to me back in the day , they didn't know what the older students and younger students react i bet they pray for the older students and younger students to get along on the first day of school, to see their reaction. IT will help they can be friends, like they tell something about them self or they will fight either like some older students make fun of the younger kids that will be a problem to me this how it will go down the younger kids start fighting back and then it will be a war zone of fight older vs younger. The older students have to assist the younger students, to do service hours or get credit on service and to do more and more service hours",0
"Special students are the same as regular students, but people say that students who have problems or disabilities count as ""Special childs."" My brother had difficulties with his reading because he didn't know how to read that much, he went to a special class and he had improve his reading skills over the past ten years. Moreover, This is my last reason why i'll rather have afterschool programs.

This is all of my reasons why I'll rather have special and afterschool programs than not having nothing to do afterschool. If you need a fun program in the whole city of Generic_City, NextUp is the best one you could find.. My favorite one is that is easier to do your homework because you will have more free time at home. In transition, this is one reason why I'll rather have afterschool programs.

Another reason why I like afterschool programs is because is a easier and faster way to do your homework. I'll rather have afterschool programs because is a better way to improve your skills, is easier to do your homework, and it helps students with special disabilities.

One reason why I'll rather have afterschools program is because it improves your skills more than you could ever had. Did you know that teachers work with one of the best culture of the entire world? Teachers work with smart and beautiful students who want to have a bright future. To get in a program, all you have to do is ask for that program's sign up paper and sign it. I'll rather do my homework afterschool because they can help me and I could have more free time at home to do whatever I want. Students argue about having afterschool programs because is bored. Afterschool programs are reasons why students have been growing a lot this past years. Homework is good to improve your grades specially if they count as a quiz grade, because quiz grades count as thirty percent of your grade! Furthermore, There's one more reason why i'll rather have afterschool programs than having nothing.

Last but not least, A reason why a like having afterschool programs is because it helps special students who have disabilities. I had a friend call Generic_Name who had really bad grades, he sign up in a afterschool program and in a few weeks, he already had almost all A's",0
"People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorites about lifes important matters. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better.

Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.

These are the reasons why making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts.. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful.

Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistake's helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistake's will make you a more successful person. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life.

One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it",0

"When you take the initiative to go beyond a skill already mastered, you open yourself up to new opportunities, gain new perspectives, and build a portfolio of experiences that can help you stand out from the crowd. With each challenge successfully completed, you gain a greater understanding of yourself, strengthen your existing skills, and develop new ones. 
Pushing yourself beyond your current level of mastery is essential to achieving true success. There is no way to move forward without taking risks, and the only way to expand your boundaries and find new success is by taking the initiative to research and try something new and difficult.",1

For many international students, summer breaks have become especially short. Ultimately, a balance needs to be struck in order to ensure both academic and personal success.. This can have a major impact on student satisfaction and preparedness for the school year. Students may not have enough time to travel or visit family, resulting in more stress and limited opportunities to form meaningful connections. In recent years, summer breaks have been trending shorter, leaving students with less time to relax or take advantage of travel opportunities. It gives students the time to learn about different cultures and gain knowledge from historical sites, as well as hone their skills in areas such as language and cultural fluency. 
Summer break is a much-anticipated respite from the stresses of school. With limited time off from school, they may not have the opportunity to visit family or explore their own cultures. 

However, the negative effect of a shorter summer break cannot be ignored. 

Despite potential challenges, a shorter summer break can still provide some benefits. 

Ultimately, it is essential to investigate the opportunities and drawbacks of shorter summer breaks in order to explore the best ways of preparing students for the school year",1
"As such, it can be a great option for students looking to get a quality education while balancing other commitments and interests. Additionally, many online courses are asynchronous, meaning students can access lectures and submit assignments on their own time. Moreover, distance learning requires a great deal of self-discipline to stay on top of course material and complete assignments in a timely manner. Not to mention, these courses can often be more affordable than traditional classes. 

Overall, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to whether students should take advantage of distance learning opportunities. On the plus side, distance learning allows students to learn in their own environment where they can better control their schedule and other distractions. Before deciding, one must consider the pros and cons to make a well-informed decision for their unique situation.. 

On the other hand, there can be downsides to opting for distance learning. Finally, this type of learning can be isolating and lack the social aspects that come with traditional in-person learning. What works best for each individual student will depend on a variety of factors such as budget, goals, and preferences. On the other hand, some may be apprehensive about this type of learning, as traditional schooling provides invaluable benefits such as personal interaction with teachers and classmates, individualized instruction, and consistent feedback. For one, there is no classroom setting, so teachers may be less available to answer questions face-to-face or have limited access to resources. 
Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years with more and more schools offering online or virtual classes. 

For those considering taking advantage of distance learning opportunities, I believe there are both pros and cons to consider",1
"When you have a job at business office or somewhere else, they will watch you how you behave, why they should higher you, handel your working and etc. For example if you are in team or more than that, when you participate your members may asking quiestios to solve the problems, what are the planes for next few weeks we will do, or projects. So you have to think about others like; family, parents, brothers or sisters, grandparents, collagues (sometime), friends when they helping me in some situation and after that I do care. push yourself and at least do your best to succeed. Just don't overthink about yourself, and just do not forget about other who you have.. I disagree with Emerson statement about individuality, because you can't think about only yourself, I mean sometimes but not everytime like me, me, me and nothing else bised yourself. And ""it's about teamwork not a selfish"" if you decide to ignore and don't even trying to helping your team members, what kind of person they will think about you as team member, but if you will help your team, well then...",0
"In other case, the law can heaven preserve them from eventual aggression in the minor. Because we have a french proverb what said ""Tell me who do you walking with and I will tell you who are you?"" And the best people for approve your friend and answers us the fabulous question ""Who are you?"" Is our parents.

Furthermore, this law would reduce work of 911. When the parent stay at home with their children that can help them to planning the schedule of the sleeping period to be the optimal version of parent of their children. This easily influenced can associate them with a sort of people disreputable.

In auditioning, the curfew can help a teenagers in their education. And this sense of priority can help them to be a wonderful adult.

Finally,to sum up the situation, we saying our vision about the beneficial effect of the curfew in our marvelous city. Because we never know what can happen in a teenagers party, they can do a prank call challenge, they can have a fire in party, or they can fight. the idea there is to leave a parent with their children to help them to be close and to know each other. In this case, parents are the main piece of the education of children. This laws prohibit to see a teenager on the street at 10 P.M weekday and midnight weekend. Because the first priority of a teenager is school and they can have time for studying, that decision can create the future amazing men and women in the future for emergence of our city. A city council is debating for the adoption of the curfew for teenagers. To have a fantastic performance in everything we doing, we need to have our eight hours of sleeping that is also the case of school. The beneficial effect what can impact our the families situations, the local authority, the society and in school, or class. To have a marvelous performance at test and at class we need to sleep the time recommend by a specialist. For example that will help the 911 to reduce call for emergency at night. In this prompt we will show the reason why the curfew can be a marvelous benefit for teenagers and keep them out of trouble.

In beginning, the decision is reassuring for the parents. Because everyone know that most of the crime are commit at night and that can not be the moment where we leave our teenagers outside. Because the curfew can sharpen their sense of priority what is actually to back home before 10 P.M. The curfew can assure the best future for the children in our city and

United State of America. In this case, teenagers can learn to be organize and responsible. That create an enormous positives and negatives reactions the rabble who is for the curfew and who disagree this and said we are in a free country. Because teenager are the principal target of people in the street because they are easily influenced. If this case, parents can have a few control into the life of their children. That rule can be very strict for some people, but that is after a long analyze the best way to put our teenagers safe. Because sometime we have a parent suffering from high blood pressure and don't know where their children are can affect them. that can help teenager to study. We do not know who the people who walk in our street and their mentality. For example, when the parents know where their children are that can help them to stay calm. . We have immensity and variety of people in our street like drugs dealer, a daring, and a rabble we do not go to let our children walking in this environment at night. In this case, that can help teenagers to sleep early. In this case, the law can decrease a criminality rate in the street",0
"With the help of guidance, people can be more successful in life and achieve their dreams.. 

Guidance can provide reassurance in knowing one’s decisions are sound. Guidance can also help break through indecision. Guidance can provide insight into potential pitfalls and unfavorable consequences, allowing one to make more informed decisions and avoiding costly mistakes. By providing support and encouragement, guidance can help give someone the confidence to make decisions and move forward. Guidance from those who have been in similar situations or have similar goals and interests can offer more accurate advice and help people take the right steps to achieve their goals. Guidance can help widen one’s perspective, provide reassurance, and help make the most informed decisions possible. Seeking guidance from someone with a different perspective can help broaden one’s understanding of a situation and provide a better perspective on how to proceed. 

Seeking guidance from trusted sources is important in making sure decisions have a positive outcome. 
Making decisions is an essential part of life, and seeking guidance when making them can help people be successful and achieve their goals",1
"This system would allow students to use points to purchase their favorite snacks, while also incentivizing them to select healthier options with more points. It is important to take into consideration all the pros and cons of this option, as well as the impact it could have on students' physical, overall, and academic health.. 
One possible way schools can balance school meals is by implementing a points system. By putting foods into assigned categories and setting different point values for each, schools could help guide students to make healthier choices while also allowing students freedom to choose.

The biggest advantage of a points system is that it would create student-specific meal plans, taking into account each student's dietary needs and preferences. 
It is also important to note that the effectiveness of the points system can vary among different students and depending on the school. It could also potentially reduce the amount of food waste in school since students would only be purchasing items they actually want to eat. 

Overall, a points system could be a viable way to provide healthy food options in schools while still allowing students to enjoy their favorite snacks. By incentivizing healthy choices, there is a risk that students will be more likely to go for the healthier options simply because they get more points. Additionally, it would encourage healthier snacking while also allowing for the occasional treat.

However, it is important to consider the drawbacks of a points system as well. Furthermore, with rising food prices, it may be difficult for students from lower-income households to afford the more expensive, healthier snacks",1
"Secondly, after achieving something, usually that person feels joyous for the reality that it's over. Your confidence will grow high because if you did it at a first try then you can do anything that you feel afraid of. You have to be sure about yourself and letting your confident falls over your fears because with fear nothing is possible. One word in English might mean five different words in Spanish and some words aren't even similar. Do you feel confident comes from achievement or for praise? People are concern about the students must be self-confident in order to learn and other thinks that self-esteem come after you achieve something. For instance, in all the world there are always different kinds of people: positive and negative. To begin with by achieving something, you are getting what you fought for and self-confident come as the result. The satisfaction of telling yourself that it is over and summer is coming, there are no more worries about next day because you have fought for eight months to pass it. First, people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while. Learning a new language, being someone who knows Spanish and want to learn English is pretty hard. Why? Some words might mean the same as the do in English but all of them do. If you study for a long time then when the time arrives, you will feel ready to pass it. Believing in yourself is feeling confident. However I still believe that confident have to come before the achievement because confident is courage that every person put itself into his or her heart to full-fill the fear.

As previously stated, things cannot be achieve if there is no confident on it. People need self-esteem in order to function at work and keep learning, the confident and positively that is in every person will make possible for them to get things done, and confident is a feeling of courage that makes the fear goes away. Nobody was born with the intelligent to get something form the beginning. You have to make a mix of all the things you have to include to get it. For example, achieving something is no that easy. Because you won't have any clue about what is going to happen in that first meeting and those people who will hired you have to feel like you are really to do the job. If something is achieved then the fear will go away and the confident will stay forever. Make the confident to cover your fear and be sure what you are doing. People might think a lot of things but this is my opinion; to achieve something you have to be full of self-confident. Thirdly, confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. For example, anger doesn't let someone to concentrate and it lead to chaos. When you are at school, it is so easy for old people to think that students just have the obligation of going to school and nothing more at all. Hope you enjoy this and it will be helpful for your day. But what if the SOL is failed twice won't that prejudice your next year. Some examples could be people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while, people have to be confident and positive in order to get something done, and confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do.

Succeeding in something is a great achievement but if there is no confident how can you be sure what you. My solution is to have confident in yourself. They won't choose you if they feel you are not really and no have confident to do well the job.

However other people think that self-esteem come from achievement. For instance, there are some jobs like a doctor they never stop learning new things because at some moment a new disease will appear and new medicine will developed. That's happiness in yourself but what is you fail, all the effort for the last night is not over yet because you have to do it again until you pass it. Thank you!!. Positive people always think that everything will go right and they tell themselves that they will end up knowing this job like their own hands. The confident that you put yourself every day to come to school even if you feel bad is the one who will keep all your information and it will help you in your nightmares that is those big tests. Let's pretend that you pass it in the first try, well, you achieved it and you are happy because it's over and now you are getting closer to get a car and drive by your own. You will never gonna to achieve to learn the whole language no even the native can but you will build a confident inside yourself knowing that you will never going to be done with it but you will be learning everyday new words. Why? Because they have confidence that they can do anything if they fight for it. When you are learning to walk for the first time, you fall and fall until your knees get red and even end up with blood but after all that effort comes the realize that now you don't depend on them to get something because now you can do it by your own. SOL is a good example of it; teachers prepared us for about eight months to pass a test that is no that long, the problem is that it's not just one SOL but many of it no including the exams. Secondly, you have to be confident and positive in order to get something done. When trying to find a new job at any place but you don't know how is going to be like or how they are going to receive you. Learning a new job it's so frustrate because at the beginning you won't have any idea on what you are doing. For example, if you study so hard for the driving test the night before and feel like you know you are going pass it. When you pass something, you achieve it somehow. Lastly, a positive person is someone who is full of joy and feels confident for what it wants and it's there to fight until it's achieve it. Studying it's not just passing classes but it's about learning things for the next day. When the final days of school comes and the exams and SOL arrive slowly and you are feeling unprepared for it",0
"Next, The problems I face when I come to U.S.A. Finally, I love the taste of Indian street stalls and they are cheep.

Lastly, I want to learn how to dance because every one have their own thing, and I want to proof that if we are different that means we are unique. I still remember my last day at school .

It is in India (Generic_City). If people say that,""Your country is not good.'' Then tell them that,'If something have some bad parts it also have something good, that makes it different.'' It can change how people think. ''I want you'' to find the good parts that can surprise them like I ask you have you seen a temple made with real gold?. In future, where you want to visit? Think, if

you were on my place would you like to tell them about your country. Secondly, I want to see LOCATION_NAME (Generic_City) and LOCATION_NAME (Generic_City) because it is something different and it is fun to take pictures. India is a country in Asia.

After, eating our burger my dad ask for bill and it was so cheep. Family and friends are important. I do not want to go to school because I did not had any friends. It is the second most populated country in the world. Because of LOCATION_NAME I want to visit there, but this is not the only reason I want to meet my friends and family in India, and I want to enjoy the tasty food, and I also want to see LOCATION_NAME in Generic_City.

Firstly, the reason why I want to go to India is because my friends and my family lives there",0

It can be very enjoyable to explore for example you can go to South Africa there are amazing food, animals if you go to the zoo its amazing, and fun to do with family or friends or even alone. Humans have tendency to procrastinate and be like

"" oh i'm going to do my homework and this or that tomorrow I have so much stuff to do""

"Students would have a hard time with home work or studying. Students would not like to have in extra half an hour.

Second, students would have more drama every day at school because of the extra half an hour. I disagree with school the board of adding one an half hour each day to school. Also having the extra half an hour would change every thing students then, would not have time to do the thing they like to do like going to their friend house or play outside, because of the extra half an hour.

In conclusion having the school board plan to add one an half hour to the school each day would mean that students would not want to come to school. Many students would most likely not like having extra school time because they have other thing to do. Students would go around the school an start drama every where then, students would have a hard time focusing in class. Having a extra half an hour would not be good for the school because students would not be focus in class.

First, students would have more class work. Having an extra hour would not be so good because students then, would be messing the thing they do not want to mess. Students would have more drama each day at school. Because, of the extra half an hour students would have to wake up in the morning and thing about the school extra half an hour and students would have more class work, study more for a subject. Then, their grades would start going down. Having an extra half an hour would then be a problem because it would be more work, drama and other thing. Although having an extra half an hour would have many problems students would most likely have more drama then ever before.

Lastly, having an extra half an hour students would not like having it because students would be messing thing, such as football games, soccer games maybe even a cook out at the park with their family. For instances many of the students would have to study after they did class work they would not want to study in the mean time they would want to take a break. Also, students have other thing to do for example they might have to go see their family. Students would have more class work like math or home work.                 . Then, students would start drama at school then, students would not be focus in class. Also having more time in school students would then mess other thing beside school. They, would have more projects, more class work students would have a hard time focusing when doing their class work",0
"I was curious about different types of instrument, and soon began to learn the recorder, xylophone, percussion, and the violin. Music has been a passion of mine ever since.. As I practiced and explored these instruments, I began to participate in musical contests, concerts, and any other opportunity to showcase my talents.

When my father abandoned me and my sisters, it build up strength on me and my sisters because, we had to learn that are father is not always going to be there when we want him to be there and we have learned that we don't need a father for everthing and we can do it by ourselfs",0
"There are many fun activities in classes that students should work in group like you can debates to other groups on any class topic. They think it is kind of challenge to them against other groups. Working in group

Sometime working alone can be hard, because by working alone you can't know your class mates and then you don't have any friends to work. Students can study as a group for test they can make some quizzes for their group to study for test that way they can do better in test.

Working in a group is important to students and it has many benefits. So that's why working in a groups is beneficially. that way they give their best to work and complete assignment on time. Like working on project is fun when you have group, because every person have different idea and when as a group you put all ideas together it is going to be very interesting and by working in group you can increase your knowledge. students can focus more than working individual. Many people do jobs with different kinds of experience people and they work as a groups they get many benefits in group work. So students should work in group, Although, working with group is more beneficial because you can know more about your class friends, can have fun during work and you can divide work in group.

First reason, why working in a group is more beneficial, because you can know more about your class friends. In group work students can help each other as friends explains something to each other.

Another reason, why working in group is more beneficial, because you can have fun during group activity. There are many students that come from other countries or other school so they should work in group. So it is great for students to work in groups and to learn many new thing from other students. That turn a boring topic into fun topic so that way students can also work happily.

Finally, why working in group is more beneficial because you can divide work in groups that way students can complete work on time.  . It is good idea to show for those students that come from other countries they will love to know the way they work in class and it is great for English learner because By working in group you have to talk more then work",0
"I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the they want you to be.

I start with my family; How i said my family they don't like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the I don't want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the they don't like to much, they don't like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment.

In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; The happen to me alot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the you have, so you have to be like the company want you to be and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else.

That's why I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who don't belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often.. I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because people in this world want you to be another person that yourself",0
"

But it is important to remember that being true to yourself is essential for a happy and healthy life. There are no right or wrong answers in life, and you should not live your life according to anyone else's expectations. 
In today's world, it's easy to forget the importance of simply being yourself. It is your differences that make you unique and special.

When you are comfortable in your own skin, you will also be more likely to take on challenging tasks, explore new opportunities, and communicate your needs and wants with others in an effective way. As a result, many of us fall into the trap of trying to conform to expectations in order to fit in and be accepted. By being yourself, you will have a greater sense of purpose and direction in your life. We are constantly bombarded with messages and information from society and the media telling us what we should and shouldn't do. You are unique – no one else shares the same character traits, life experiences, and views as you. By being yourself, you will be able to create a life worth living.. You will also be more confident in your decisions, and have the courage to pursue your dreams.

At the end of the day, the most important thing is for you to stay true to yourself and do what makes you happy",1
"The theories of the causes for the repenting blinding, or way some patients wake up to the coma and other don't. Today Mr. The reason why when some one brake a leg the time of the recuperation is different; the reason why when a car chars happen the patient has to went to a T.C. The reason why cancer happen, if it is in our DNA or can happen with anyone.

This partnership can help me to learn the theories. When I first get interest in the medicine area, what I what was help people, be like the doctors that helped my little brother; learn how someone can save lives. Yes we are kids, but in other hand we are the future and if we don't think about it who will think for us?

It's necessary start to think in the future doctors, the grow of the modern medicine start to pass the learning to the next generation, the theories, and start to pass the learning to the next generation. Some may think that teenage are just kids and is not necessary think about the future. If it's possible create a substitute to the glasses, what will be the percentage of people who have obesity in the future.

This partnership can teach me what the doctor learn all this years. I really hope that you chose me and gave me a chance to me for prove myself, and learn many knew things in this process that will help me to grow as a person, and as a future provisional that can learn knew things every moment in the medicine area, the future is coming and we are the chose that you want to make.. Talk about how the treatment to the cancer cell can be done with radiation, and what can be done to change this process because of the negative effects in the humans body. can help me to learn more to help others, to help who needs. Yes, some times it's, but if you learn knew things this can help in your future, and prepared you to possibility that you haven't imagined. How will be possible in the future faith with the cancer and the autism to help the people that have it; how its possible someone o broke the cervical walk again. The learn of the doctors can help me to learn why the things are doing this way, for example em de patient stop to breathe the doctor has to put a tub to the patient start to breathe; and if this don't work the doctor has to do a mini-surgery. Talk about the big number of surgery in the kids, and how it's possible do something do the recuperation be less painful to the kid and to the parents",0
"For example, an individual striving for excellence could be a young student who works hard to get the highest grades in their class. Through persistent effort, study, and practice, the student is able to pass the test – and reach their goal.

In conclusion, the Castle Standard is a concept focusing on striving for excellence and going above and beyond the basic requirements. An example of determination is a marathon runner who continues running even when their body is exhausted. By remaining determined and focused on their goals, individuals can achieve anything.. 
The Castle Standard is a concept that emphasizes striving for excellence in whatever one does. They might set their own, higher expectations and work diligently to achieve them.

Determination is an essential part of reaching any goal. Despite their fatigue, they have the willpower to cross the finish line.

Goal-setting is an important tool for growth and progress. An example of how one can reach their goals is a student who sets the goal of passing a tricky exam. By setting realistic yet challenging goals, and working diligently towards them, one can slowly but surely reach their destination. This could mean going above and beyond standards, pushing boundaries, and working diligently to reach a higher level of excellence. It involves unwavering commitment and a strong will to succeed in spite of any challenges one may face. Determination and goal-setting are key to reaching any goal, no matter how big or small, and progress is encouraged when realistic yet challenging targets are set",1
"And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.

At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.

Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. If they need it because they can loose their job.

Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. They will know what kind of project to create. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. Students and teachers have important roles in their life. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project",0
"This essay will discuss the advantages of students working alone, such as improved time management, better focus, and self-challenging. While working in groups certainly has its advantages, such as enabling collaboration, working alone has the potential to be incredibly beneficial as well. When working in groups, there is always the potential for one's time to be wasted due to slim productivity from other group members or sidetracking conversations. 

Lastly, working alone presents the opportunity for self-challenging. When working alone, however, students can set their own pace and dedicate their time to their own tasks accordingly without interruption.

With respect to focus, working alone can also help ensure that students are best able to use their attention on their own studies, rather than be distracted by others in the group. 
Many students face the challenge of deciding whether to work on their studies alone or in groups. It can be difficult to hold oneself accountable to do more than what is asked of them, but working alone provides the motivation to go above and beyond. Working alone enables students to stay in their own zone and keep distractions and extraneous conversations to a minimum. It allows for improved time management, better focus, and self-challenging. 

In terms of time management, working alone is a great way to stay on task and use one's time wisely. All of these elements are key for students to become successful and should be taken into serious consideration.. With no one around to rely on, taking the initiative to add to the project is crucial.

In conclusion, working alone has many advantages for students",1
"because if you are just idle you're not get anything done in your whole life and just sitting idle it's not going to help you see what you acutely need for your life, or your family life, or if you don't have a family think about your future.

They are people who don't have the life as you do. being a idle it's not going tho help you you life depends on you and your ideas. like some students say that they just want to be a famous ,if you want to a famous or important you better do something in your life, the other famous people did something they weren't idle in fact they spend their time just to tell us to do something in our life. they wish and dream to have a better life to do what they want to do the things they wish to but you already have a live and everything you need in your life so dream big and make it come true. if you have dreams

Life needs energy to do something imagine you have a good ideas about doing a project in engineering and you designed really impressive, and the teacher like it and you entered the engineering science.

years later you found a good job in your career and you you have money, that make everyone proud about what you just did in your life and your family are thankful to you.

Life needs you and your ideas to prove yourself don't sit and do nothing and wast your time playing around

. . trust yourself and ideas that's make your life easier to you. don't just sit idle and do nothing

Think about what you going to do. because if you are just idle and doing nothing that doesn't make any since you have to do what ever you want to do it's your life no noes life your own life fight for it and go crazy for if and never give up says I con't do this and it's possible yes you can. like if you want to be a doctor you have to study for your dreams to be what ever you wanted to be.

"Philosopher, Physical, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others, actually being a example can not be a good thing to influence others becuase first you need to start doing the right thing on your own before you decide to be a example or influence others and that's mean that you need to do everything perfect when that's means that it is hard to do it.

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, I learned how to be responsible with my things for my mom and my dad because they teaches me how to do it and that this need practice too and I also they teaches me that being a example with our own behavior makes you humildity and teaches you how to valore what you already has and accept what

I don't have.

In conclusion, they want to argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because being a good example by your own behavior teaches they how to do the things rights, so they can influence others by doing and taking the right way and also teach how to be responsible, honest, and being respect to others.. For example, they believe that being responsible with their own behavior is a good example to start doing the right way and to influence others because the responsability gives to others respect. I believe that being honest with others is a good example by start setting our own example behaviors. They also say the having respect to others is a good example of our behaviors and being humildity is also a nice examples that we can teach or influenes to others. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others.

However, they believe that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people and being a good example makes they feel responsible to others and they feel that they have the responsability to do the right way in their own so that they can be a good example to others.

In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others. They say the being on time in any meeting makes they responsible with their own behavior and gives other a good example of responsability. I also believe that humildity is a good example of our behavior because the humildity and that responsability is something that I can learn from others with their own actions or their behaviors. They believed that being honest with anyone is also a good example of our behaviors. They say that responsability is a example of our own behavior and can be something that they can learn with the time and needs practice",0
"From a student's perspective, having access to a cell phone during class may seem convenient, but others argue that cell phone use can be a distraction and negatively affect their academic performance. 
Cell phones have become a hot topic when it comes to the debate about whether they should be allowed in the classroom. While some believe that students should be trusted with self-control when it comes to personal phone use, others argue that even small distractions can add up and hamper learning. While there can be benefits to having access to a cell phone in class, as well as potential drawbacks, it is ultimately up to the educational institution to decide how and when cell phones should be given access.",1
"Learning and sharing experiences with others presents incredible opportunities to better understand and empathize with one another. His wise advice stopped me from making a potentially hazardous decision that day, and I am eternally grateful to him for his guidance. I remember a time when my uncle shared his experiences during a particularly dangerous situation. Sharing our experiences and wisdom can benefit our lives and future immensely, teaching us to be more cautious and fostering understanding and compassion among different groups.

Studying the cultures, laws, religions, and languages of different countries around the world can open our eyes to the incredible diversity of humanity. By sharing our wisdom we can prevent our friends and family from making catastrophic mistakes",1
"Additionally, if a student feels they do not have sufficient support, resources, or guidance when deciding their future, they may opt to choose a career without sufficient thought. On the other hand, some argue that the idea of choosing a career too early may be too much of a constraint on one's educational and career choices, and can even be detrimental, leading to immobility and dissatisfaction.

When evaluating this prompt, it is important to consider the various social, economic and personal factors influencing a student's decision. Moreover, personal motivations and choices also play an important role in a student's decision-making process; if a student has a strong passion for a particular profession they may choose it despite the challenges it entails, while another may be swayed by other considerations such as future income or job security.

Overall, the decision to commit to a career during one's early years is a complex one that could have far-reaching implications for the student's future. 
The subject of students committing to a career in their early years has been a point of contention among scholars and the general public for some time. For example, in certain economic or social contexts, the pressure to choose a career early in life may be even more pronounced. On the one hand, there are those who advocate for students deciding their future early because of the various benefits this can bring, such as a clearer sense of direction and the ability to take advantage of specialized programs and classes. Therefore, it is important that students take the time to research the field they are interested in and be aware of their own motivations and constraints before making a decision.",1
"On the other hand, finishing school in three or four years could help American students accelerate their career paths and graduate with less debt. Working full-time means that they could gain valuable job experience but might have less time for studying or extracurricular activities. 
After researching the advantages and disadvantages of finishing school in three or four years, I determined that it can sometimes be beneficial for a student to finish school in one year early. This could give them increased access to more opportunities than other students. 

For Hispanic students, finishing school in three or four years could mean completing their educational requirements sooner in order to secure a job and support their families. 

American students also have advantages and disadvantages when it comes to leaving school early or working full-time. It allows students to gain a more comprehensive educational experience while still allowing them the opportunity to join the job market at a younger age.. On the other hand, some Hispanic students may prefer to stay in school to enrich their educational experience or to delay entering into the job market. 

Considering all the advantages and disadvantages for Hispanic and American students, I believe that finishing school in three or four years is usually the best option",1
"Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you don't understand what's going on in the class. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it.              . That is because it's not the same thing as going to school. I think that taking class in school is way better, teachers help you, you get better knowledge, you communicate more with others. Overall, I don't think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes.

I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my opinion, I dont think the students would benefit taking classes at the comfort of their homes. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes. Some people just learn differently.

In conclusion everyone is different. Overall there is no right or wrong you just pick what you learn best and just do it. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since you're at home",0
"I also spoke to someone who currently has the job to gain more insight into the career and to how I could go about preparing for it. I analyzed the skills I learned in high school and considered how they could help me in my chosen career path.

Ultimately, I determined the dedication and passion I would need to have to succeed in this field.. I then investigated possible ways to learn more about this career, such as attending events, taking classes and participating in trips that are available",1
"As people limit their contact with each other, they limit their exposure to external factors that may disrupt their daily lives. It has enabled people to lead more efficient, safer, and ultimately healthier lives.. Individuals can regularly read about or watch news broadcasts that update them with the most recent information about news and events. This helps them stay informed without having to constantly interact with other people. Furthermore, technology can help create an awareness of how news and events in the world can affect individuals personally, making them more cognizant of their environments. 
In recent years, technology has been a great aid to humans in limiting contact with one another, especially during times of change or crisis. 

Technology also allows users to keep up-to-date on world news. Such use has helped to improve physical and mental health for individuals around the globe.

"us humans should help everyone we can even if it's little people sometimes don't ask for help but if they dont ask you tell them you need help.

Some people also may disagree because they might think only about themselves or they think that there at a good point that they dont have to try anymore or try there very best they think thieve mastered the problems and situations. You should always try to strive to become the best you can be.

I say people should agree on this because not trying to fix your or improve yourself is not the best way to go. Do i agree or disagree that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow? In my own opinion i say i would agree in my 17 years on this earth that i have to agree because if you stay to comfortable you won't do anything in life you will want it all easy and not try to strive for the best version of yourself.

you can stay comfortable but it won't help because your just wasting time and effort that you could become a better human being and spread your knowledge with other people. but the point is don't settle for okay do more.

We Should learn not to stay cozy you should try to improve a bit everyday or learn something new help yourself and help each other out if they need help or if you need it learning and talking to other people wont hurt you so like

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow""

is a true fact and you should try to be a better human or person in life and become someone that people can look up too.. They think that they can't learn anything else but there wrong we human beings can always learn something more strive to be better humans, father,mothers,sons,daughters etc... Like they shouldn't disagree i say because it not a bad or good thing but it would be amazing to push yourself and be more educated get pain a lot for having that big of a knowledge and use it think help people that can't help themselves",0
"I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. I had my license and my life was going go too.

To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. Life dosen't work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again? . So I study hard and where i'm I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you don't know something don't leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist won't be there all ways. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I don't mess up again. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I can't drive. ""Aww man, I **** hate this, I don't know how to make this spaghetti and meatball sandwich I had the wheat bread, the sauce, manssreala cheese, spaghetti and my meatballs what else in this world am I missing. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. I over did with the salt a little bit. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on.

Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I won't do that chemical bond ever again.""

Often successes can help both young and older student. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I don't pass then I don't ever get my license even when I really old. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created. He said ""Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill."" That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it."" I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. We both learn a lesson that nobody is perfect the first time. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often",0

Despite some potential advantages, a four day school week can present some difficulties for students. 

As an illustration of the issues that students can face with a four day school week, imagine a student who needs to balance playing in the band, helping out with his younger brother, and having a part-time job. Moreover, students without alternate supervision during an extra non-school day may have difficulty helping out with younger siblings or other siblings’ needs due to their own school commitments. Additionally, students looking to make money by working part-time may be held back by reduced hours due to the shorter school week. With less time spent in class, teachers don’t have as much time to dive into difficult concepts, create projects, or provide additional instruction to struggling students. Additionally, the “catch-up” that the students have to do after a day away from school can add extra stress to their lives. 

While there are potential savings in energy and resources from having shorter weeks, the amount of time that students have to learn new material is reduced as well. Having the extra day off from school greatly reduces the amount of time he has to practice and his ability to find time to help his brother with his own homework. The savings in energy and resources from the four day school week is far outweighed by the pressure it can put on students who have further commitments outside of their school day.. For example, students may not have the time to engage in extracurricular activities that would otherwise be beneficial to their development. Without a day to practice sports teams, participate in clubs, or get help with homework, certain activities become increasingly difficult to manage",1
"One particularly attractive project is interning at a hospital known for its high reputation in the VA area. From my research, I have learned of the tremendous responsibility nurses have in preserving and extending people's lives through preventive healthcare and therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, this internship offers an invaluable opportunity to gain experience over the summer break with the potential for future career prospects.. This internship can provide countless benefits, such as sharpening clinical skills, widening professional networks, and building practical knowledge within the healthcare field. 
Nurses play an integral role in healthcare, providing invaluable services to those in need. 

To gain a deeper understanding of the nursing field, I have explored various volunteer opportunities in my local area. I have extensively researched this amazing profession by reading books, scouring online resources, and listening to stories from current and former nurses",1
"All in all, the benefits of community parks are undeniable.. Exercise is also easily integrated into a park outing, whether it be walking, running, cycling, or playing sports. For friends and family, it can be an excellent way to build strong bonds, with opportunities to play games, talk, and just spend time together. For students, parks can also offer the perfect environment to get away from noisy and distracting environments, and to focus on completing school work in a peaceful, natural setting. 
Spending time at a community park has abundant benefits, both for individuals and for the communities they come from",1
"College is a serious thing so all people need to prepare for to go there ,when you go to the college you have a idea that difficult be for you but not impossible . For example student wants to graduate and wants to be a mechanic he needs to keep going in high school for four years he learn about that career he wants and another subjects.

Some people they do not like the idea for to graduate early because they do not think that is prepare for to go to college. a lot people think four years on school is good because in that years you can take to much classes. I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college

Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. Probably be more hard but you can do it, you need to try the best do yo have for in the future you will be a good person with a good job and can help your family. when help your family you are a good person and recognize that job was your parents did for you so keep going and do it a 4 years in high school this is good for success in life .. for me both reason is good because you need to stay in school for to be successful and understand why some persons wants to graduate early they wants to help his/her family so both options that is very good.

Four years in high school is the bets option can you choose because you learn more, study more, and prepare more , for me that is the good way for to successful in life. in four years you take more classes and learning about it. you need to pass all your classes in college but for that you need to study and try your best in high school that is the way for a good student .

Some people prefer graduate one year early , they has reasons, they wants to finish the career for to help the family or some people just finish the high school and go to work. is probably is the bigger reason why some people choose that opinion. Some schools offer programs for students graduate in three years? students needs to go school for learn and be success in life in high school normally is four years but some schools give to students some programs for to graduate in three years",0
"That's what I think that working online or video conferencing is a more easy way to lear for the students, and also I think is a big opportunity too.. Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they don't need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school.

For example, if you work at home, you don't need permission to use the bathroom, because you're at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. One of the reasons are that I think this can be a more easy way for students to learn is because they cannot be distract to anothers students, so they can work with tranquility. I agree about that some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, the students can would benefit. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.

Another example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you don't finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time.

In conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits",0

When examining individuals who actively strive to reach their ambitions, the key component is the clear focus on their objectives. 
Thomas Jefferson once famously declared that “nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude"". To illustrate this idea, we can consider the example of Steve Jobs: an ambitious man who sought to revolutionize the world of technology. They will create tangible plans, allowing them to establish deadlines and strides in reaching their goals. He did not simply wait for his goals to come to fruition; instead, he was actively involved in every step of the creation process, from in-depth market research to detailed product testing and design.

In contrast, there are those who fail to reach their dreams because they do not strive to actively pursue their goals. Those who do not have a clear focus do not tend to be willing to make sacrifices or take risks to push themselves further. To put it simply: having an active attitude of determination and ambition can truly bring success. His words have a powerful resonance in our present day, for it is clear that those who act on their dreams and goals can achieve far more than those who do not. 

In conclusion, it is undeniably true that individuals who have an active ambition to strive towards their goals will become more successful than those who do not, as stated by Thomas Jefferson. For example, many aspiring entrepreneurs will not risk their financial security in order to invest in their ideas, as they are not motivated to work towards their dreams. Achieving one’s ambitions does not come easy, and for those willing to work hard, the rewards can be great.",1
"Through social media and video-conferencing, family members who live far away can easily stay in touch, filling thousands of miles of physical space with the warmth of digital connection. The loss of some in-person connections and social interactions has the potential to increase feelings of isolation and depression. In addition, digital contact does not always amount to satisfactory communication; meaningful conversations and emotional bonds can only truly be formed through face-to-face contact. On one hand, technology has enabled people to connect from literally any corner of the world in an instant. 
The effects of technology limiting human contact have been widely researched and debated. 

On the other hand, such restriction of human contact, while convenient, can also have its drawbacks. In addition, with the rise of freelance work, more and more people have been able to turn their passions into professions without ever having to leave their homes; they can take on jobs located anywhere and communicate seamlessly to reach their goals. Finally, the infiltration of technology into nearly every realm of our lives can lead to overstimulation and couldn’t-care-less attitudes, as people become too overwhelmed or desensitized to take action.

"These strategies are meant to harness the potential of technology while limiting the interference of digital distraction.. Schools around the world have instituted policies regarding the use of devices in the classroom, with varying levels of success. 
Recent studies have been conducted to research the impact of device usage on students' academic performance. There are several strategies for mitigating the negative effects of device usage in the classroom, such as discouragement of use during instruction or implementation of specific software and tools for educational purposes. The presence of devices in the classroom can be a source of distraction, leading to decreased academic performance",1
"Therefore students should start thinking about a career because it would be coming so fast.

These the reasons why students should commit to a career at a young age for a better future.. I think students should commit to career at young age because of these reasons.

Students should commit to a career at a young age because it may have them in school because students may be thinking about there future and then get movtivated to get more done. Students at young age also be invasted in the career they may choose for example being a soccer player, being a basketball player, being a football player etc. This the first reason why students should commit to a career at a young age cause it will help them become a better person in life and also help there future.

Students should also commit to a career because it will help them perpare for life because they will be getting for college and thats a big step from highschool that is there road to succues because when they are in college they will be learing about there future job whiles if students who don't think about there future at a young age will probaly go down hill for them somethng like getting into drugs or getting killed this is a second reason why students should commit to a career at a young age.

Students should commit to a career so that can can have a good life because if you don't think of a career at a young age you will not be good in life there many example like being homeless",0
"Taking classes online from home has several advantages, such as providing a low-cost learning option. Home-schoolers must be aware of the lack of social interaction that online courses often provide. Additionally, there is more freedom to tailor a learning strategy to individual preferences. However, there are also disadvantages to take into consideration. One possible solution is to take advantage of the increasing availability of online courses. By researching the advantages and disadvantages of taking classes online from home, along with different learning strategies that could benefit home-schoolers, one can make an informed decision as to the best way to maximize the educational opportunities for their home-schoolers.. Moreover, online courses require more self-discipline and time management than traditional classes. Online courses provide home-schoolers with access to a wide range of educational topics and resources. Before pursuing online classes from home, it is important to evaluate both the cost and benefit of this approach. 
The recent uptick in public discourse around homeschooling has generated questions about how to maximize the educational opportunities of home-schoolers",1
"It is not a good things for us. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. We can use the less time to do more work.

So that is why I think has the limtation of human contact due to the use of technongy had positive on people's live.. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. Technology

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. It save many time and improve the work. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing. We need cost more time. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us.

People do not need contact work together. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work",0
"and also if they go alone they can also have some alone time on their own or even make friends with other people who also brought their dogs with the,and by this they will have some fun outdoors and also find that going to the park was a fun idea.

Another way to have fun or spend time outdoors is to go to the beach on your free time to clear your mind from all the things you did on workdays like from Monday to Friday,having al those kind of stuff on your shoulder at work I think that this will be the best time to go to go to the beach. They are many things or ways one, or a family can spend their time when outside or their time in the outdoors. But if you think that in your opinion that my first point I made about going to the beach was not the best idea then i think the second point may be the best reason why someone will have interest in going to the beach. The main reason why someone will go to the beach is to have the best time of his or her life or maybe find someone that the person is attractive to when they go to the beach.. And also will see that activity to be fun at the same time and will like to do it all the time.

One of the activities that one can do outdoors is going to the community park to have some fun alone or with their family to enjoy the environment and leave their life the way they want to, also they can take their dog with them and have fun with them some of the activities they can be doing with the dog is training them how to jump,catch things,and also how to make friends with other dogs in the area of the park they are",0
"I don't think its fair to change the policy.

What if the students were close to have an a grade or b ? We all are trying are best and for you gust to come and change the policy. Because them thinking that they could only be in a sport if they have an a or b . And your not going to like the way everything is going to be.. But if you just come and take those sports away trust me its not going to be so good at all! Guys are going to argue about soccer and foot ball. students are even going to have worse grades. And them trying there best to bring grades up and have more points! ITS NOT fair.

I say you just leave the things the way it is! Kids are going to do better in school and bring there grades up. Girls are going to argue about there sports and there not going like it.

Leave everything the way you think is best but there not going to like it and the scores are going to down",0

"They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. then they will get caught by the police and they'll have to face their actions.

If they put the 10 P.M. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Parents wouldn't be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. m. Teenagers sometimes think it's not important to learn like if it isn't important. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults.

Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didn't have parent's. I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Most of the time kids don't even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldn't feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. . Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law.

Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Kids would go home early to their parents. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful.

In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they don't. They know their going to get in trouble. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. That's why parents would feel like it's a great idea for the city council to put this new law. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. m. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. Kids would go to sleep early. curfew law. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they don't let them go out. Teenagers shouldn't be in the streets after 10 P.M. If they don't listen after they've been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back",0
"Actually, we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed in something that we wanted more than one time because, being consistent is a way the learn and become successful. If Generic_Name hadn't been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldn't have passed the text. This time he studied much better than the first time but he didn't pass it again, he felt stressful ""what's going on to me"" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. As the British Prime

Minister Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm"". Adopting the failure is the way to become master and complete our goals. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail sometimes.

In conclusion, based in those reasons I support Churchill's statement, and I'm agree with the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. But, I still needed to get a car, fortunately my parents brought me one. As result he passed the test with a good score. As example of this is my self. Now I have a car and my driver's license even though I was hard to make it. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. In that point I wasn's really sure if I wanted to continue with that. I felt sad about it, but after studying all the rules again I came back to take on this time I was able to pass it as well. They think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldn't have done before, is a way to waste time because, you're not going to complete it anyways. They also believe that it's really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you don't achieve success.

One reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. Then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. But it wasn't that easy because, firstly, I had to pass the driver test, next learn how drive and finally get a car.         . Also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal.

Those who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. What happened to Generic_Name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. First, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didn't pass it as well. Second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. But this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Everyone have experimented failure in some point of their lives. Actually we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something that we want because, it's a way to learn more and a way to build our confidence, and we also become successful by being consistent. As example of this is my friend, Generic_Name, who had to take his math test multiply times. The last year I had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. A way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. What happened to me is a perfect example of being consistent and don't give to get success. But should we really continue pursuing success after fail many times, even knowing that, it might be really difficult?. If I hadn't been consistent even that I had failed it, I wouldn't have gotten my driver license. Then I decided con continue it and I went to take the test, I couldn't pass it at the first time. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times.

Other reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. Then, my parents decided that it was time to let me drive. I was really excited thinking in the way that my daily was going to change",0
"Teachers can provide students one-on-one feedback to address areas of difficulty or confusion, as well as praise for a job well done. Distance learning can also be less engaging for students, as it can lack the competition and collaboration seen in traditional classrooms.

Studies have found that interpersonal interactions between teachers and students are important for learning. 
Distance learning has some notable drawbacks compared to traditional classroom-based instruction. Finally, teachers can serve as a model of success and inspire students to reach their goals.

While online courses do offer a more flexible learning option, they cannot replicate the communication, competition, and inspiration of a traditional classroom. Furthermore, there may be less motivation to succeed as there is no sense of competition.

Attending classes in person is an invaluable educational experience that offers communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers that distance learning cannot. Interaction with peers is limited and feedback from teachers can be delayed or difficult to understand. Traditional classrooms provide students with the guidance and support they need to be successful, as well as an engaging learning environment that promotes engagement and independent learning.. The presence of peers in the classroom creates an atmosphere of competition that encourages students to work harder. For example, distance learning may not allow for face-to-face interaction, making it difficult for teachers to provide feedback and support. Communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers can all have a positive impact on student performance and engagement",1
"It can be a major distraction for students, detracting from their focus on academics. In addition, the use of phones in school can act as a safety measure, as having a phone on them gives students the ability to easily contact parents and guardians in case of an emergency.

On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks to allowing students to use their phones in school. 
Proponents of allowing students to bring their phones to school argue that phones offer a number of educational benefits such as access to educational apps, online resources, and digital work collaboration. Furthermore, it is possible that allowing phones in school unfairly gives an advantage to students who can afford the latest technology, potentially creating a digital divide.. It may also lead to potential cyberbullying in school as well as encourage cheating",1
"This can be done without any rush or worry, allowing students to take the time they need to work on their projects.

Overall, summer breaks allow students to take necessary time off from the academic rigor and can accelerate learning in the following year when students are able to tackle their studies with renewed motivation and perspective. While shorter breaks may seem more manageable for educational institutions to plan, it’s always been argued that having extended periods of summer break is important for students.

Firstly, the schoolwork that many students have to do can be overwhelming. Short breaks for the rest of the year provide mini breaks throughout the school year, which can be just as beneficial as longer breaks. In many places, the summer holidays can last anywhere from 6-10 weeks, while for the rest of the year, there are short breaks lasting around 1-3 weeks. Extended summer holidays give students a much-needed break from the pressures of school and allow them to recuperate mentally. 
Schools around the world differ in how long they break for summer. For example, summers provide a great opportunity to travel — allowing students to explore different cultures and expand their horizons. At home, students can dedicate time to reading books, working on creative projects, learning music or sports, and more. Therefore, it is extremely useful for educational institutions to have extended periods of summer break and shorter breaks for the rest of the year.. This time helps students to relax and come back to school feeling refreshed, enabling them to tackle their studies with renewed enthusiasm.

During summer holidays, students can benefit from being exposed to new experiences, which can also encourage learnings outside the classroom and school walls. This will help them to grow and develop into well-rounded individuals.

Moreover, extended summer holidays can also allow students to pursue hobbies and interests that supplement what they learn in school",1

"also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because he's so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two.

The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you can't stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff.

The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you don't have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didn't so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that don't wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it. Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you don't have to worry about for college. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you don't then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines.

The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and don't need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business.                                   . Then college is for you and you don't have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you can't stop because people that put the work they don't stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others don't because the were born with golden life.

Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something don't have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing",0
"By working with others, one gains the opportunity to manage their time more effectively, as multiple people can contribute to a task and complete it more quickly. Furthermore, group work is an effective way to make new friends. Spending time with peers with different interests can lead to a more fulfilling workplace environment. In addition, collaboration can result in the acquisition of new knowledge due to the diversity of perspectives present. For instance, a research team with members from different backgrounds will be able to approach their task from varied angles, and combine them to form a more comprehensive understanding. 
Excerpt:

Working in a group has many benefits over working alone, making it an advantageous research practice. To sum up, there are many advantages to working in a group, from saving time and incorporating new information to making friends in the workplace.",1
"I lost more than just a friend, but my trust and faith in someone else. On the other hand, bad influences are often manipulative, disloyal, and quick to be dishonest when things don't go their way. Good influences are encouraging, supportive, and understand when you make the decision to be true to yourself. I soon learned that this person had lied to me and was not the friend I thought they were. It's not wrong to be kind and have faith in those around you, but it's also important to know your limits, pay attention to the red flags, and be confident in your decisions and beliefs.. 

When I was younger, I made a mistake of accepting a bad friendship with someone who pushed me to make decisions I was uncomfortable with. 
Throughout this essay, I will explore the importance of trusting people, experiences where my trust has been broken, and how to identify bad influences. This experience made me realize the importance of being able to trust other people and not succumb to changing just because it's difficult to stay firm about who you are. Despite their bad influence, I trusted them and allowed myself to be controlled for fear of losing them. 

I learned the importance of trusting people, but also verifying if they will be a positive or negative presence in your life. 

It's essential to determine if a person is a good influence or a bad influence. This can be done by assessing how someone makes you feel, what kind of advice they give you, and how they react when you refuse to do something they ask you to do",1
"Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it. As log as you are aware of what you are doing, you will know what is best for you. You can confront it or let it change you. Some people will form their own character, or because they don't know what to do anymore. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different.

For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever.

These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. Anyone's personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life.                                       . Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. The first thing to consider, is that one person is not going to behave the same way as someone else, and all people are not going to act the way as they did when they were kids. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different.

It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. All these things may change you character behavior. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just don't pay attention to it, and do what they want. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it.

These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person",0
"She's in good health. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria. It's a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day.

Majority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. Students will be able to play sports, run fast, accomplish their goals, and discover new things in life. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. If you're fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. Also, they will be more active. Students need to start eating healthy, and take care of themselves so they can stay energetic for the rest of the day. It's a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system.

After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that she's never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that there's always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasn't taking care of herself so that's why she gained weight. No more junk food in the cafeteria anymore. Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, she's 60 years old, and she doesn't have any diseases or anything. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit.

Students will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. Healthier school lunch menu would benefit a lot of students, and illustrate them ""To purify, and be bright"". Cafeteria should have healthy lunch menu. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health.    . They will be diligence towards their diet.

Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness. They will be able to trust the process of eating healthy, and keep up with it. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. Cafeteria needs to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods. It might not be the best food for the students but it's good for their health.

Junk food is not good for health. In lunch, they will eat proteins, for example: meat, nuts, and beans, also milk, water, stay energized for the rest of the day, and not have any disease or pain.

Students will not be obese or gain a lot of weight. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health.

"However, I kept a positive outlook and persevered. 

This experience proved that having a good attitude can have a lasting impact. My parents had always told me to remain positive, no matter the situation. By following my parents’ advice to maintain a positive outlook, I was able to accomplish something I never thought possible and ultimately improve the outcome of my situation.. After months of job searching, I was starting to get discouraged. I decided to take their advice and put it into practice when it came to my professional endeavors. A positive outlook can benefit us in many ways. In the end, I was able to land my dream job. 
One key factor in leading a successful life is having a good attitude. Had I let my discouragement get the best of me, my outcomes may have been much different. Recently, I experienced the positive effects of having a good attitude first-hand. It can help us see the good in any situation, overcome obstacles, motivate us to stay goal-oriented, and improve our relationships with others",1

"It can be easy to forget the power that comes with being an expert, but those who can remain humble and wise will often be able to make wiser decisions and more inspiring leads. On the other hand, being an expert means you hold a certain amount of power due to your knowledge and experience. However, one should never forget the pressure and accountability that goes alongside such a position, and should strive to remain humble in order to make wise and informed decisions.. This can be difficult, as it is not always easy to please everyone. What does it mean to be an expert in any area? To be an expert is to be an authority in your field, someone who others turn to for knowledge and advice. 
As society progresses further, we are increasingly reliant on experts to guide us in our decisions. Many people, from those asking the questions to those benefiting from the answer, are depending on the accuracy and quality of your work. 

Overall, it is a great honor to be an expert in any field. 

On the one hand, being an expert means that you may feel a large burden of accountability. This can come with great responsibility, but with it also come certain privileges. Holding such a responsibility means that you will have the potential to benefit and influence many people",1
"

Beyond environmental influences, people also rely on their own internal emotional responses for forming first impressions. Similarly, a child who experiences a chaotic or oppressive home environment may find it difficult to be open and trust strangers. They may be influenced by their own facial expressions, thoughts, and bodily reactions in response to a new situation or person. In this way, first impressions are a combination of both the individual's and their environment's impact, and it is possible to both form and change a perception of a person.. 
When it comes to forming first impressions, humans often rely heavily on environmental and parental influences. Even a positive home environment can have an impact on a person's first impressions, as a growing child is likely to take on the values and beliefs of their parents as they form their own identity. For instance, a child with a parent who has a naturally outgoing personality is likely to be influenced to be an extrovert",1
"I'm looking forward to utilizing them in different social situations in the future.. 

I've also considered my behavior in different social situations and determined which personality type best fits those situations. 
Reflecting on my personality traits has been an eye-opening experience. I've asked my family and friends what type of traits they think I possess, and the responses were incredibly revealing. For example, when meeting new people, my friendly and compassionate nature comes in handy. 

Reflecting on the traits I possess and thinking about how I can strengthen them has been beneficial. In difficult situations, I rely on my reliability to get me through. They are beneficial, as these traits help me build relationships with people. I used online resources to research more about character traits, and discovered that these traits are often known as the 'agreeable' type. According to them, I am a friendly, compassionate and reliable person",1
"Generally, food in the United States is more processed and convenience-based than in Puerto Rico and El Salvador, where traditional, made-from-scratch, home-cooked meals are more common. 

Comparisons like this can help one reflect on their outlook on life and their place in the world. Educational values vary, as in Puerto Rico, families often prioritize education for their children, while in El Salvador, the focus is more on growing up quickly and with minimal schooling. Discipline also varies, with stricter structures in El Salvador and Puerto Rico, and more relaxed attitudes in the United States. 
When researching everyday life in Puerto Rico, El Salvador, and the United States, it is important to take into consideration the various customs, family dynamics, clothing, education, and discipline methods in each place. Understanding the experiences of those around us can help us foster compassion, connection, and appreciation for the beauty and diversity of the human experience.. Clothing in Puerto Rico ranges from everyday casual to formal, with a focus on traditional dress for special occasions, whereas in El Salvador clothing is more casual and the focus is more on practicality. Life in different countries can offer insight into new ways of thinking and looking at the world, expanding one's horizons and experiences. In Puerto Rico and El Salvador, family is typically very central to life, while in the United States, families may have more distance between them",1
"PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall

for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do",0
"By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot.

Lastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don't know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. They might give you respect if you're not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person.

Secondly, If you are honest ""all the time"" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. May cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn't know.. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. I also think that ""honesty"" and ""truth"" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.

In conclusion, I disagree with ""Honesty is the best policy"" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. However, keep some things to yourself if you think it's not positive to say to another. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Lastly, A person might see you differently if you're honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said.

Firstly, there isn't a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. I disagree, I think if you are honest all the time, you might say some mean things to a person, which might hurt their feelings.

First, being honest is good, that's how you earn trust. Sometimes you have to say what's right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said",0

Impression is the effect someone has on another person through their attitude and behavior. To protect their reputation, an individual should strive to maintain a consistent image and be mindful of their behavior at all times to ensure their impression is not damaged.. It is the lasting thought or feeling created by the individual in a social interaction. Impression can also be used as a tool or gift, providing someone with the opportunity to lend their presence to assist a cause or project. Celebrities and prominent people can use their impression to create a powerful impact; for example, a public figure may use an engaging, confident attitude to draw attention to their platform",1
"Additionally, students may also factor in the amount of time involved in the activity, as many are already juggling schoolwork with extra-curriculars. The availability of activities is an important consideration, as is the cost associated with the activity.  Lastly, students might also take into account their own goals - whether or not they are passionate about the activity, whether they can gain practical experience or develop skills - when choosing which activities to pursue.. For students with tight budgets, the cost can be a deterrent, especially if the cost of supplies and equipment for the activity is high. 
When it comes to deciding whether to pursue extracurricular activities, students consider a variety of factors",1
"Finally, I joined an online tournament, connecting with players from around the world and further refining my gameplay. With all the hard work, I was ready to face the tournament and come out victorious!. I watched professional players on YouTube and streamed sites for tips on how to make my game great. I even looked for local tournaments, signing up to compete against local players to test my skills. I read up on strategies and techniques, spending hours in practice sessions to solidify my understanding. I studied the different characters, learning their strengths and weaknesses. 
Preparing for the Super Smash Brothers tournament took dedication and hard work",1
"We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social.

One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Technology is something we need now a days because there's creations all over the world being created everyday.

Human contact is what we expect but now a days we can't find that because it either go on snapchat, instagram, or add a friend on facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens. So human contact can be limited now days but there isn't any change becaue more and more techonlogy keeps coming towards our way and we can't stop it.

In conclusion this is what I think about technology ive given positive and negative feed back about technology on human contact.. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. Technology has given us humans positive and negavtive effects in life. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everyday's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Human contact is something that we need everywhere in life we need these things at work,school,sports teams and more. For example Bullying is serious and negavtive effect on us, Bullying isn't just physical contact there is cyber bullying and that's were the technology come in",0

Dear, Mr Generic_Name. The side options our school menu currently have are just fine; they meet the expatiation's of a healthy side option; the offer fruits vegetables and the occasional desert.

The health of your students and my peers are important, and a big part of being healthy starts with what you put in your body, so please continue with the plan of changing the school menu, our future self's will deeply appreciate it. Do you see the problem with the food items listed above? 99% of the schools menu contain high levels of fat and carbohydrates, which is not a proper meal for a growing student, or any human being. We need the main meal/ main dish to be the most healthiest thing on our trays, not the side dishes.

The students at our school may be disappointed with the sudden change in the school menu, but they'll just have to adjust to a healthier menu. I for one think it's a grate idea to change our school menu into a much healthier one.

Our current school menu has its redeeming qualities, but it also has a few lose ends. For example; they serve things like pizza, burgers, rice with chicken, nachos, spaghetti, Pb&j , and salad. Thank you for our time.

Sensually, Generic_Name.. I remember seeing posters like the food pyramid, posted on the lunch room walls of my middle and elementary schools, but not once did the school lunches follow that expatiation. This is the problem with the school menus all over America today, they serve fatty foods filled with carbohydrates and not enough protein, fibers, and good fats.

As growing students, we need food that'll give us energy through out the day, and keep us focused in our classes, but the current menu isn't serving us the food we need; don't get me wrong, they have things like fruits, vegetables, and other good side options, but that's not enough. It'll be nice if the school menu items was a bit more healthier, but the side options must stay the same. I am a student who is in attendance at your high school, writhing to you about the changing of our school menu",0
"From elementary to middle school students are allowed to choose what they want to study toward a specific career or what they want to be. Students committing to a career when they about to enter high school is by far a great idea. People believe in what they want to believe in so I say that commit takes responsible ,but I know that we teenager can change the world and show them that not all teens are the same and keep believing in what career you want to commit to because committing is not an easy thing to do expressly when you are a young teen or kids .I know people say that we can commit to what we want ,but not everyone is good at committing to a career when it comes to young and committing to something that is big than your own head or mind. When they enter middle school and that when students from elementary school start thinking about their choice and taking their career choice serious ,because that when they start thinking what they want to do in the near future. When middle school students start taking these class students think only about passing so that they can not repeat that class and some just want to pass the class but mostly it about passing the class so that they can be able to get credit, and that leads to taking the class the will help that person career or what kind of career they are into. Students committing to a career is a great idea when you really want to do it .

Committing to career

When elementary students are in 5th grade they start carefully thinking about what they are gonna do,

because when they are in 5th grade it their last year in elementary school so they have to think about what they want to do. When looking you will find a lot teens thinking about their career .The career they want to commit to and some teens do change want they want to be , but still they are committing to it and they can just change if they do not want to do it .For some reasons young teens around the world that are still in middle school are already commit to a career and that is a good thing right most of them are really into it , and they are taking their career far enough .So far like 10,00 teens are most famous because of their career that they are doing now and they take serious because they like and they are good at it mostly middle school teens. Elementary students have 4 years where they take class that are chosen for them in the 4 years they study just to get good grade ,but they do not think about choosing the class for themselves .But when it comes to 5th grade they still study the class that are chosen for them except that when they start to think what if I could choose the class that I want to study for my career or what kind job I am going to study to be able to get that job and that how they start committing to a career .when it comes to elementary school students.

Middle school students are commit to career because they are teens and they have to think about a lot of things that they want to do personally when it comes to career or what they want to be when they grow up that when they start .Committing to career start in elementary , but mostly it begins for real in middle school because that when young teens start taking class like algebra,earth science,biology ,world history, etc . But when it comes to middle school students they can choose what class they want to take for a specific career they have in mind .

Student can commit to a career when they enter high school , but they do that when the student already know what they want to be or what they want to do by the time they enter high school so the student at they would be committing to what the student want to do so the person doing so chooses the class the person want to study . When kids are still in elementary they can say what they want to be, but they can not choose the class for the specific reason because they are still kids. So keep believing in what you want to commit to because once you found it I know for sure whatever it is you will success ,because we you teens work hard for our dream.. Who believe that some teens can not commit might be wrong because people change teenager hood do change as well

.

For these who believe in change I as well believe in change people do change and they can commit to what they want to commit to as well as job, career,family or love. These days they are unstoppable for what they do sometimes they are good more than adult at committing to career when it comes to what they want to do in life.

Some people might argue that students identify a career by the time they enter high school , because they think some students can not do that when it comes to committing to career they think that young teens can not do it .Because technology has taken the mind of teens .They say that teens can not do anything because all they think about is technology and all the things they do they always use technology so some people do not believe that teens these day can commit to anything i .Many people believe that it is hard for teens to commit ,because they can not take responsible of what they do and some think that they are so imature .When it comes to committing to career the parents thinks it how they act at home that why they can not commit to career and some thinks it how they behavior when they are in school .Some people believe that teens can not commit to a career ,because they do not know what to do and some thinks that young teens can not do it because they changes their mind most of their time on settling on what they want to do .Bunch of people believe that teenager can not do it because they quite so early and so easily anyway a lot people do say that can can not be a good generation because they do not know what to do.

But it doe not mean that all teenager are bad some might change when they grow up and some might not change ,because they just do not want to change consoling the thing they might have gone through so for these people",0
"While some opt to stay home and relax, others may benefit from participating in organized activities. In addition, participating in activities teaches kids how to work and cooperate with other people. From gaining necessary life skills and learning to manage time to forming friendships with others and discovering passions, kids should be encouraged to engage in organized activities. Through organized activities, adolescents become more independent and develop decision-making skills. 

In conclusion, participating in activities after school can bring numerous benefits to children’s lives. This, in turn, leads to improved communication skills which are essential in all areas of life.

Joining activities also provides the opportunity to meet new people and form meaningful connections with peers, coaches, and adults. 
Many children today are faced with the decision of what they should do after school. They learn to manage their time and prioritize tasks and activities. It is an important part of their development and growth.. This type of social interaction is important for building confidence, self-esteem, resilience, and healthy relationships. 

Engaging in activities after school can teach children work ethic, organizational skills, responsibility, and discipline. Through organized activities, kids can develop their passions and explore new interests without feeling overwhelmed. Offering young people a variety of activities to explore can enrich their lives and provide invaluable skills and experiences",1
"You can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change.

One reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment.

If i would have to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend.

The first time when i met him was in my math class, He did not even wanted talk to me and be my partner, when i asked him about problems that i did not understand he ignored me and he did not answer.

To conclude If i would have to to take a position on this issue i would disagree, the reason why i would disagree is because in my circle of friends there is 2 of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.. Based on my experiences i would say that is not true because people always can change.

Im my opinion i think people say that because with the person that they are talking to or they are meeting does not show interest on them.

The first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed",0
"By expressing their unique ideas and taking independent action, individuals can become visionaries and drive positive change.

For example, visionary scientists have pushed the boundaries of understanding and have discovered groundbreaking theories that sparked important advancements in science and medicine. Individuality is a key factor in helping people achieve their goals and ultimately make a positive difference in the world.

In conclusion, individuality is critical in allowing people to explore different paths and express their unique perspectives. Galileo Galilei, for example, was a trailblazer in astronomy who challenged convention and introduced new theories regarding the motion of planets in our solar system. Not only does it inspire risk-taking and creative problem-solving, but also encourages people to think outside the box. By embracing individualism and exercising independent thought, people can find unlocked potential within themselves and reach great heights of accomplishments.. Similarly, Marie Curie showed tremendous courage and independence in her work with radiation, making revolutionary discoveries in the field that continue to impact our lives today.

These inspiring stories demonstrate how important individuality is. 
Individuality is an important trait that can help people discover and achieve great success in life. It gives people the opportunity to become visionaries and drive innovative advancements in different fields, which can benefit society as a whole. It encourages consideration of different perspectives and allows people to find solutions to seemingly impossible problems",1
"

One distinct advantage to technology is that it reduces the amount of time needed to complete mundane tasks. With the help of smartphones and other devices, people can access a plethora of information, meaning they have access to a host of tools and knowledge at the touch of a button. There are undeniable benefits to technological advancement, particularly in terms of reducing the amount of time needed to complete daily tasks and increasing our autonomy and convenience. 

Not only does technology reduce the time spent on tasks, it also provides greater autonomy and convenience to people's lives. By reducing the amount of time required to do certain tasks and providing greater autonomy and convenience, technology has the potential to make life easier and simpler for everyone.. This makes tasks that would have otherwise been difficult or impossible not long ago significantly easier.

In conclusion, it is clear that technology can provide a substantial positive impact on people's lives. While the limitation of physical contact between people may be considered a drawback of technology, it is not the only possible outcome. Similarly, online banking services help people manage their finances faster through the convenience of automation. 
In the modern world, technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives. For example, the introduction of automated machines has drastically reduced the amount of time needed to manufacture products",1
"Strategies that have been effective for these individuals include staying focused, continuously learning, and never giving up.

Showing what one can accomplish certainly has an impact. Rowling once struggled with depression, but set the goal of writing a book, which became the beloved Harry Potter series.

The reasons why some people set easier goals, while others set more difficult ones, vary from person to person. For example, Gal Gadot, the actress who achieved worldwide success playing Wonder Woman, set a goal when she was just a teenager and never stopped working to achieve it. There are countless anecdotes of people who have achieved something incredible by setting a goal. Sometimes, the decision to set a more or less difficult goal is based on the individual’s risk profile. Similarly, J.K. 
The 3rd president of the U.S.A., Thomas Jefferson, once famously said that “I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.” Many people have taken this quote to heart, and emphasize the importance of setting and working towards goals. Other times, it is based on personal experience of what has or has not worked in the past.

No matter how hard or easy the goal may be, it is those that try hard and work hard that achieve something. 

It is undeniable, however, that setting a goal helps to focus and motivate people. However, there are some people who believe that setting goals can lead to disappointment, and that one should not put too much stock in trying to achieve something. It also serves as an example of the importance of setting and working towards goals.. It can inspire and motivate, proving to somebody that anything is possible with hard work and dedication. People like Gal Gadot, J.K. Rowling, and countless others have achieved something by keeping their eyes on the prize and working hard",1
"nothing is impossible to go better to better.. we need take care for not fall the clases.

The teacher well be ready to very year cause sometime the students well be ready for start the year. I think the students they need prepare every year after the summer or other vacation.

Is not bad have vacation in the year because all time study is no good, because the maind no have a relax, the maind need to distract in other thing.

I am not good student but a try to get one is so dificult for me cuse I'm not speak englihs good, but this is not scuse for not study in spring break or in summer, this is for every day to bad studen to good student. Is necessary to be ready to next year. I dont like becuase the student forget all information of the year in the vacations. Teachers or educators feel that the summer because students do not retain information.

I thick when the student have a spring breack or summer vacation we need study in vacatio for not forget all information, we take in the year of the school",0
"I am confident that with these benefits in place, my ambition to be successful in my career path can become a reality.. 
After research and analysis, I believe that the company I am applying to has many benefits that would fit my personal goals and ambitions. Furthermore, the company's commitment to workplace diversity and inclusion helps to create a more welcoming and productive environment that will be beneficial for both my professional and personal development. This includes a comprehensive benefits package, competitive salaries, and opportunities for career advancement and growth. Additionally, they offer unique and innovative opportunities for collaboration with team members, as well as a supportive environment that encourages employees to take ownership of their work",1
"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of techology had positive or negative effects on people's lives.

(

middle)

Because people sometime left the important stuff for be on their phone and that can distract to be preparate for any other things. but for person's who has business is more easier by using techonology. Also people's due bad things like don't put attention on class or don't look their childs .However people's like to much techonology that they do all with that, we sometime are not responsible that we fight we others person's just for we cool or for be increduble. If we put limited using to much techonology we cannt effect our life and we can see that we can survive with that. And students who need to make some homework or look for somenthing is a good choose.

Thousand of people's can a bad decition on using the techonology, because they never put a limited choosing not good decition but other's people used very well and understand that we have real life and we need to preparate for make a very well deciton, techonology had positive and negative effects.",0
"With pre-credit courses available, students can often take classes that will count towards their course requirements, enabling them to reduce the amount of classes needed to graduate. For those with certain legal statuses who are eligible to qualify, it can be an excellent opportunity to save time and money. However, there are some drawbacks to this option. 
Graduating from high school in three years is a challenging proposition, but one that may be advantageous for some students. Additionally, some high schools may not offer the necessary courses needed for early graduation. Taking this route requires careful consideration before making a decision.. Financially, the cost of taking more classes can quickly add up, leading to more expenses",1
"No they shouldn't add an hour more because we don't need the hour but they should completely change the time for waking up and getting ready to come to school at 8 because i feel like every kid will have energy and not fall asleep.

also i think they should put each class an hour like example math should be an hour also Science , English , geography because all we honestly do need is come to school get our education then go home we dont need all stuff they put like electives they just make the day more longer and waste of our time honestly thats my opinion and how i see it.

they should only put the one hour in for the kids that need help or catch up with there missing work and that will help more for them because it would benefit them more but after all the day i think they shouldn't put that extra hour but like i said only if kids need help they should put the extra hour in.

after all they shouldn't make it an hour because its really not worth it if we already have a long day of school they should just take electives away so school can go more faster and just get it over it also just get our education faster.        ",0
"One topic is frequetly debated is whether or not should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some people think that because students can learn more. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she don't say anything when we are using our phones.

Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more.

One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and don't distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they don't listening to the teacher while she's explain. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read.

Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they don't have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and that's one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i don't have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and that's why i don't do your homework.

The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases.

In conclusion why the school days can extending two hours is because most students want to stay in the school to participated in activities of the school or participated in some football teams.. They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends",0
"Nothing but to hope that they will get better. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. Everything will get better. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. life is full of lessons that will teach us something. Cause if you do look down you won't see your bright future that will come.

Do good things in your life. . what's the point of being mean. if we dont how can we know things will get better.

We need to have hope to learn the lesson.

The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind.

For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. Its's making the problem worse. Always look up never down. life is never easy. Because when you grow up you won't be able to go back

In the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Like be nice to people don't be rude, disrespectful, and mean. That's not going to help you in life. I started to believe. Give things time, be patient. Enjoy it bore it ends.

Everyone goes through something in their life. It helped me a lot. I would share that life is not easy. Life teaches us a lesson. Don't take your anger out on others. But that didn't help. enjoy your childhood. Taking your anger out on someone who didn't do anything is not going to help. You don't know what can happen if you rush things in life. How is this going to help me in life. thats how life is. We need to believe, have hope in life. But then i realized why am i thinking negative? and not trying. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson.

Don't rush things in your life. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. Enjoy your life as much as you can. I opened my eyes and began to try. Things got harder for me. I didn't have hope. Just don't think negative",0
"The experience shaped my outlook on life, teaching me that it was never about reaching the final destination; it was about the journey and everything that came with it.. I felt so let down and frustrated that I had let myself down.

It took time, but I was able to reflect on the experience and realize that failure was an inevitable part of life and instead of beating myself up, I needed to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes.

In the end, I found the courage to get over the failure and start again. I had been working tirelessly for weeks on a project, and had put so much effort and energy into it. When the results weren't what I had hoped for, the disappointment was overwhelming. 
I remember a time when I experienced failure. I learned that I was capable of bouncing back from failure and working towards something greater, despite the bumps on the road. Learning from the experience helped me to become more resilient and persistent in everything I chose to do in life",1
"Instead, we must confront these moments and hardships and strive to grow from them.. Life throws curveballs at us all the time—whether it be a nasty breakup, the death of a loved one, or coming face-to-face with a person who does not share our morality. Life has its ups and downs, and having a positive attitude won't make these times disappear. 
Many people believe that having a positive attitude is the key to life and will allow them to make it through any tough situation without any difficulty. However, this idea simply isn't true. It's unrealistic to think we can simply float through life without going through any hardship by having a positive attitude alone. 

We can choose to think positively in these life-altering situations, sure, but no amount of optimism will erase the fact that these events are difficult and will take immense strength and resilience to push through. 

It's not wrong to view life through a positive lens; but we cannot solely rely on this kind of comedic realism when reality is sometimes anything but funny. A positive attitude will not alleviate these challenges; instead, one must face them head-on in order to move past them",1
"The first thing to consider, is that one person is not going to behave the same way as someone else, and all people are not going to act the way as they did when they were kids. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever.

These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. Anyone's personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it.

These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just don't pay attention to it, and do what they want. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. You can confront it or let it change you. Some people will form their own character, or because they don't know what to do anymore.                                       . All these things may change you character behavior. As log as you are aware of what you are doing, you will know what is best for you. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different.

It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different.

For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time",0
"Additionally, making too early of a career decision can limit a young person's view of future possibilities and keep them from exploring options they may have later wished they had considered. On the positive side, young people who decide to pursue a specific career early on benefit from the ability to take specialized courses that are available in high school and college, as well as having more time to build experience and skills in the field they are interested in. As long as the decision is well-researched and the risks and benefits are taken into consideration, young people have the opportunity to make an informed decision that can lead to future success.. Although taking the time to explore different options and find the best fit is always encouraged, making a career decision early can be beneficial for some. 
Making a career decision at a young age can be a major life choice that can have both positive and negative effects. 

On the other hand, making a career choice at a young age also carries a certain level of risk. If the choice is incorrect, it can lead to stress and frustration as the individual's educational path is limited. Additionally, pursuing a career at an early age can allow a young person to save up money and gain financial stability sooner, easing the burden of tuition and other costs down the road. It is also not guaranteed that the chosen career will lead to future successes, even if the initial decision was a good one.

It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether or not they should pursue a career at an early age, and there are both potential risks and benefits to doing so",1
"At the park you can learn how to ride the the thing you brought and practice. There could be some animals you may have never seen before. Do you want to know some enjoyable ways to do at the park? Well, at the park you can walk your dog, you can have a picnic with family or friends, some parks have animals you can look at, and you can ride your bike, skate board, and scooter.

One enjoyable thing to do at the park is, you can walk our dog. Sometimes when you go see the animals at the park some people can tell you some stuff to learn about the animal like where is is from or what it eats and you can feed the animal food that the park provides them to eat.

Last but least, you can ride your bike, stake board, and scooter. Having picnics at the park can be good for example, the weather when it is hot or warm or it is a beautiful day outside. It's also fun because the dog can explore new places to go to.

Also it's somewhere you can take your dog to go out and enjoy nature with you. While you are riding on what you brought with you, it is fun to ride it while you see the beautiful features of the park. The park is also a safer place because there won't be a lot of cars. If you brought someone with you and they never been there before then they might like it and they would want to come back again.

Third enjoyable way to do at the park is, some parks have animals you can look at. While you are walking your do, you are also getting some exercise by walking with them. It is enjoyable to look at the animals for example, the bears, fishes, turtles, goats, chickens, and pigs. You can also go look at the pig races. Having a picnic is fun because you get to talk to the person with you and eat with them. When you are done with your picnic you can go and explore more of the park. Also you and your dog can have some time together.

Another enjoyable way to do at the park is, you can have a picnic with your family of friends. It is a good place to go and play with your friends with bikes, skate boards, and scooters because the park is safer than the street and might be a big park to play at with your friends.. Some dogs like walking, so a park is a good place to take them to go walk",0
"In the same way that we can manage our physical health by getting enough sleep, eating right, and exercising, we can maintain our mental health by managing our time and avoiding idleness. When I am tempted to dodge work, feuds with coworkers, or lambast people on social media, I can regain my composure by not reacting. When I remain positive in the face of difficult situations, I can maintain my mental health and avoid wasting my time. We still face the temptation to idleness: checking social media continually, wasting time and energy on inconsequential tasks, trying to avoid doing work, and opting out of difficult conversations. 

In my own experiences, I have found that when I avoid idleness and have a plan for how I will use my time, I am able to remain productive and focused throughout the day. 

Though technology, lifestyle, and culture have obviously changed since 1787, Thomas Jefferson's words still ring true: we can all avoid idleness by managing our time and not responding to provocation. Over time, I have also learned that not responding to provocation is a surefire way to avoid idleness. Doing so will not only benefit our mental health, but could also help to achieve amazing things.. 
Though 224 years have passed since Thomas Jefferson wrote in his autobiography that ""it is wonderful how much may be done, if we are always doing,"" his words of wisdom still have relevance in modern life",1
"In the essay, the writer explains how elements of self-esteem, achievement, confidence, trust, learning and work are integral to success. Through these examples, the essay expresses the importance of the concepts of self-esteem, achievement, confidence, trust, learning, and work in enabling success.. Another example the author gives is how hard work and dedication can lead to professional achievements and a sense of inner worth. To illustrate this, the author provides an example of how engaging in meaningful work and activities can lead to academic and career success. 
Self-esteem is defined as having a positive opinion of oneself, and achievement as reaching a goal or standard. For instance, to gain the trust of others, a person needs to demonstrate confidence and dependability in their work. Similarly, a sense of personal fulfillment and self-esteem is heightened when one achieves success in learning experiences",1
"On the other hand, it could also restrict their freedom and limit recreational activities. Parents would also benefit from a curfew, as it can reduce anxiety about their children’s safety and reaffirm their trust in the community’s ability to protect its members. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew is a controversial way to curb crime and promote healthy lifestyles among teenagers. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew can be a useful tool for protecting teenagers and reducing crime. 

Overall, a 10 P.M. On one hand, this measure could help reduce the number of late-night incidents involving teenagers, promoting their safety and citizens’ security. 
Enacting a 10 P.M.   

For teenagers, a curfew could be beneficial in keeping them out of potentially dangerous situations and limiting exposure to dangerous elements in the streets at night. However, teenagers may feel resentful if their freedom is restricted and feel deprived of opportunities for extracurricular activities and late-night socializing. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the potential consequences of this measure on teenagers and parents, and look for creative ways to ensure a balance between safety and enjoyment.",1
"As I practiced and explored these instruments, I began to participate in musical contests, concerts, and any other opportunity to showcase my talents. 
My love of music started when I joined the school choir in elementary school. I was proud to have contributed to something so meaningful. Music has been a passion of mine ever since.. My hard work paid off when I became the leader of a school band, and we wrote and performed a song for an important event. I was curious about different types of instrument, and soon began to learn the recorder, xylophone, percussion, and the violin",1
"I think what you can take summer school for to finished the school in three years is a good idea because you can leave to school in start working or doing other somethings how example you can get a good job and make good money or you can start work for to help in the hause like your mom, father, and making money for buy something for yourself like a car, clothes, and the another rason.

If the student have 17 or 18 years old he can leave the school and not when they have 22 years old like the hispanic because they coming with 15 or 16 years old and the school put they in grade nine and if you graduate in only three years is better for you, becuase they going to was 18 years old and they already for to work in learned more english but that not is the same case for American People.

With the work force for to finish the school in one year early, I think that is hard but is so good for students with 18,19,20 years old because they can finish early in lirobic time in one year.

If you're hispanic that's not better choice for you, because you can't learn more english and that's going to be hard for you when you start work, but that not is the samein the case with American People because the english not is a problem with they and if they have the same years old they can get a good job and leave the school in lirobic time.

That's what i think about the finish the school in three and not four years and the work force for to finish the school in one year early, If the school give me the oportunity choice I say ''I want to finish the school in three years'' because is better for me for my years old .",0
"
Curfews are an important tool in helping teenagers develop responsibility and self-regulation. Additionally, parents can be sure that their teens are in a safe place, and not in an environment where they are vulnerable to potential harm.

Another benefit of curfews for teenagers is that it can help build better relationships with their family. With a curfew in place, teens are discouraged from participating in risky activities such as taking part in criminal activities or driving with no license. By setting a curfew for teens, parents can ensure their child's safety, help foster better relationships, and give them a healthy lifestyle. It can help give parents peace of mind and keep teens away from risky behaviors and environments.

"However, there are also some potential drawbacks to starting work at a young age. Instead, young people should seek to find balance between pursuing their interests and furthering their education in order to be prepared for their eventual career. It is important for teenagers to take the time to explore their individual goals and get the most out of their high school experience before taking on the responsibility of a job.. In addition, adolescents can often be easily taken advantage of by those with more experience in the workforce, making it difficult for them to make the best career decisions for themselves. For instance, young people may lack the experience and critical thinking skills that come with age, making it difficult for them to effectively plan ahead and make connections. 
It is true that there are some advantages to pursuing a career at a young age. Also, starting out a career at a young age can provide a foundation for future success. 

Overall, I believe it is not always necessary for students to start a career as teenagers. For example, young people are often full of energy and enthusiasm, and they can take on tasks with a great deal of vigor and determination",1
"I wanted to make the decision on my own, without relying too much on expert advice. At the beginning of my senior year in high school, I had to decide where I wanted to go to college. If I had relied too heavily on the advice of others, I would have had to take their opinions into account and could have ended up attending a college that was not originally my first choice. 
My personal experience with self-reliance relates to my college decision. After spending months doing my own research, I ultimately decided to attend my dream school.

It should not be understated how important self-reliance is when making important decisions. It is often beneficial to seek expert opinions when making decisions, as they may be able to provide insights and resources that I may not have considered on my own.

Overall, it is important for individuals to research and consider the facts before making important decisions, and to weigh the pros and cons between self-reliance and seeking expert advice. My personal experience in relation to self-reliance is evidence of how it can play an important role in life decisions.. Self-reliance gave me the confidence and drive to make the best decision for myself.

At the same time, it is important to be aware of the pros and cons of making decisions independently versus relying on expert advice",1

"Not only can it help you when travelling in a new country, it can also help to foster meaningful connections and help enlarge business opportunities. From our research, we discovered that there are numerous benefits of being able to speak this language, especially for travelers. Not only would it make it much easier to communicate with the locals, but it would also help to build bridges and make meaningful connections with people around the world.

When it came to getting started, I took the lead and taught my friend the basics of the language, from pronunciation to conjugations. Not only did I gain knowledge about their culture and customs, but I was also able to connect said locals with potential customers, broadening my business horizons.

In summary, speaking Vietnamese has numerous benefits and can be truly rewarding. By breaking it down into segments, we were able to cover a lot of ground and eventually had a basic conversation in Vietnamese.

One major benefit of speaking Vietnamese came into play during my visit to Beihai. I had the pleasure of speaking to locals in their native language, something they deeply appreciated. 
My friend and I decided to take on the challenge of learning one of the top 10 hardest languages to learn - Vietnamese. It can be challenging to learn the language, but it's worth the effort.",1

"People change and when they do, so do impressions.

Second chances are also very important with impressions. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job.

In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Over a period of time if let's say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity. You will forgive and forget. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory.

I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. Even if you have a bad encounter with someone the five times you have met them, your opinion about them will change with just one good impression. Your first impression or somebody else's first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble.. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself.

I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. They impact whether you get the job, make that friend or even if you get service if you are somewhere. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change",0
"One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills",0
"I don't think curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, because some teenagers can get in trouble befor the curfew time so I curfew or not some teenagers will get in trouble, for example one day my sister was out with her people, and my dad told her that her curfew is 2:00 p. m but she did not come home at that time so my dad ask her why did you miss your curfew, she told my dad that what is the point of curfew and my dad told her to get you out of trouble, she was like curfew or not if I will get in trouble I will and my mom told my dad she has a point, so my dad was I like you right so when every you go out make sure you come home.

The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. For example, it is possible that student performance could improve if they are given extra time to focus on studies or better understand the material. In conclusion, the implications of adding extra time to the school day should be carefully considered before any additional hours are added.. Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours. Furthermore, local school districts could be faced with strain due to the heightened burden of providing teachers, resources, and updating curriculum to accommodate the addition",1

The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you.

"Imagine the president and the government of our country being nothing but idle and letting the country run on its own. There would be no regulation in the country. The history would repeat itself and many of the tragic historical events that happened in the past would happen again. the country was poor, people died because of huger, disease etc but now the country has accomplished so much then the people in our past would have imagined. If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish.

I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work. We talk about the American Dream a lot but being lazy and just waiting for something to happen will not take us anywhere.

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more.

We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive.

Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. There is always something to do in this world; we accomplish more when we aim higher. If we could just go out and just help one person and day, that person would help another and another to another, this would be such a great accomplishment.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson said and believe that there is more happiness in doing something everyday then being a idle. I hope everyone see's how much bad impact idle is in our lives.. Even small chores prepare us for something big. laziness is a big wooden door which can only open by ourselves and once we open that door, theres always something big waiting to happen and once we accomplish that another big adventure awaits.

In the history of United States, there were many people who idolized idle. The country has accomplished by establishing government regulation which removed all the laziness from the country. The country is well know all over the world now. We had a government who let the country run free, this had a great impact to the country. I agree that it is okay to not do anytime sometimes because everyone needs a break in their lives. Technologies serve their own purpose but we have our own purpose, we are born to do something big. There are people who believe in not having to go outside their house because they have all the technologies or they think they have nothing to do. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to",0
"If you're looking for something more interactive, many parks offer organized sports such as group softball games or fishing derbies. Other activities like reading, jogging, and bike riding can fill a day in the park with fun.

". People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincs and ideas. I take my own decisions because that can help me to grow as a person but yes sometimes we need somebody also opinion .

However , not everyone thinks like that because they like to ask for and opinion to an expert because, they think that can make you to take the decions easily and that's right but isn't enought for some people because probably they have done before and it doesn't feel enought for them , because that's the opinion that you're receiving probably you can be agree or not, but you still are thinking in what decision shoult they take decisions are not something easy nothing is easy in this life that's one obstacle in life basicaly is one step that can help you to grow as person because you can learn from bad decision that you have taked in the past.

Nevertheless ,

everyone can go to see and expert he or she can give you many types of ideas about what decision you shoul take but when you depends on someone you will never going to learn how to take decisions by your self, how I

Moreover , you don't have to take decisions by your self everything is depending on the problem it can not be a problem especificaly but in case is very important to count with other person opinion it can make your decision more easy ,like my grandfather tell me every time when I talk to him '' be sure of what are you doing'' and what I reffer with that is the you must be right of what are you doing is so important you always count with friends or someone speciall in your life those people can make your life better and far away of the problems .

Overall , people have to take their own decisions using the best way for each of them , Because decisions are not easy to take you must take it without precupation because when we worry about that and we say or we do the first thing that it comes to our brain isn't one hundred percent right sometimes it can be good or not but that's how we learn of our mistakes , that's how life work , it give you a hit when you must think nothing is going to happend, that's why is important to count with friends or your mom and dad but when you're going to ask an opinion of what decision shoul you take you must ask an adult , they are the only ones that they can give you the best ideas of what is better for you and your future and that's how you learn and the most important to grow as a person . Sometimes in life you have to take your own decisions because you can fell or not but you're going to learn what's good or bad, taking your owns decisions it teach you many things about how to take your own decisions with responsabilitie . Many people today and day has the problem about how to take decisions is so hardnees to take your own decisions, because some people think a lot of what decisions to take that's the principal moment that we need help from someone isnt's matter if your dad, mom or an expert ",0
"Going into unfamiliar territory can be intimidating, but having enthusiasm and an eagerness to learn can open doors and make it much easier to adjust and grow.

For example, let's say you're starting a business. Having a positive attitude and approach to life will make it easier to accept setbacks and look at them as learning opportunities. Failure shouldn't be feared, but should be embraced as part of the learning process that ultimately leads to success.. Attitude and enthusiasm are essential when it comes to turning failure into success. 

In conclusion, failure and success are not mutually exclusive — accepting mistakes and having an eagerness to learn from them can often be the key to achieving success. Mistakes are unavoidable, but instead of getting discouraged and giving up, embracing failure and learning from it can open up opportunities and relationships that couldn’t have been found any other way. 
Failure can be a great teacher, even when it has a discouraging effect in the short-term. The most successful entrepreneurs will often talk about the successes that came from failing — failing fast, learning from their mistakes, and applying that knowledge to build a successful business. It's important to remember that failing doesn't mean you're a ""failure"" — mistakes and failure are part of the process of growth and success",1
"Taking classes at home has numerous advantages. Learning at home also eliminates the need to travel to and from school, which can save time and money. With no designated teachers, students may have difficulties finding help when they need it. 

However, there are downsides to learning at home. Furthermore, learning from home may also lag behind in terms of academic advancements and the use of new technologies compared to those available in school classrooms. 

Consulting with teachers, counselors, parents, and peers can help students make an informed decision about whether learning at home or in school more closely aligns with their individual academic goals.. For example, students can work on their own schedule, avoid distractions such as conversations with friends, and have more flexibility with practice and assignments. 
The decision of whether to attend classes in school or take classes at home is an important one for students to make. Furthermore, without the strict accountability of classroom settings, students may have a harder time staying motivated and on top of their work",1
"
The essay will examine the role that failure plays in individual success. Similarly, many successful entrepreneurs have learned from their own failures to build successful businesses. For example, I can personally attest to the power of failure in my own life. It is often said that failure is an essential ingredient in developing personal success. To understand this phenomenon, one must look at the individual experiences and successes of successful people. In conclusion, when it comes to success, failure is not only necessary, it is inescapable. Without failure, success is impossible.. Such stories demonstrate the invaluable lesson that without failure, success cannot be achieved. After several unsuccessful attempts, I was eventually able to accomplish my goal of becoming a small business owner. Though failure can be painful, it is also immensely valuable for growth and development",1
"This attitude can lead one to have job opportunities.

Looking at the other side being negative can also help you be successful in life. This helps you have a better chance of engaging with significant people like the president. This kind of posture can benefit ones future.

If more individuals convey a positive attitude many would have better employment opportunities. Carrying a positive attitude can get you far in life. One example is by being selfish. Working for the president of the United States is a more beneficial job then working a regular nine to five. . Showing an affirmative attitude can help you work for the president and can also help you have a better income which can lead to success. Employment opportunities and getting noticed by important individuals can bring success. Job opportunities and getting notice by important people are opportunities that come with having an affirmative attitude. Having a good occupation is important.

Since it's important to have a positive image it can expand the people you meet. Obviously one should always be positive if they want a desirable outcome in life because life is too short to be unsuccessful and negative. Many believe that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. With this negative image shows that your the most important person that can only bring you a favorable outcome.

As many have stated displaying confidence is the way to go in life. One way is by having a confident posture. Jobs can help you be successful. With most success theres always positive results. Putting yourself first in everything you do can lead to success",0
"Additionally, a lack of direct contact with teachers and other students can limit the learning experience and prevent students from fully absorbing the material. Students can choose how to learn at their own pace and can also have the flexibility to work around their other commitments. They are a valuable tool for those who cannot attend traditional schools due to personal or financial reasons. They are more accessible since they can be used from virtually anywhere and require a much smaller investment. By carefully considering the pros and cons of each option, students can make an informed decision that is right for them.. 

Overall, it is clear that online classes can be an effective option for students looking to further their education. Moreover, online classes tend to be more engaging and interactive, as students can communicate with each other and the teacher via email, discussion forums and even video conferencing. They offer a number of advantages that are not available with traditional school methods, while also introducing new challenges that must be navigated. 

When compared to traditional school methods, online classes offer several advantages. For example, self-discipline is a critical factor for online students and they must have a great deal of commitment and dedication in order to stay on track with their studies. As a result, online classes are fast becoming an important option for students who want to pursue their educational goals. 

On the other hand, online classes can also be challenging for some students. 
In today's world, online classes are becoming an increasingly popular way to access education",1
"Conversely, communication that lacks agreement can lead to negative impressions. 

Although the past and environment can impact first impressions, it is possible to change them. Specific examples of how this can be achieved include gaining new experiences, being more open-minded and tolerant to new ideas, and forming positive relationships. For example, if someone has experienced a series of negative events, they may be more likely to have a negative outlook on life and be less likely to have a positive initial impression. Agreement plays a significant role here, as people who are able to empathize and understand one another's point of view tend to form more positive impressions. The way two people communicate to one another, as well as the places and people a person comes in contact with, can affect initial impressions. However, one is never truly stuck with their first impression, as it is possible to change them by having new experiences, being open-minded, and forming positive relationships.. It is worth noting, however, that first impressions are not always accurate, and getting to know a person better can often lead to more positive and lasting impressions. 

In conclusion, first impressions can be impacted by a person's past or environment. 
First impressions can be formed many ways; whether through physical and emotional events, such as the way a person looks and acts, or through various environmental factors, such as the people, places, monuments, and conversations a person is exposed to. 

The conversation between two people is a big factor in the formation of first impressions. It is possible for the past experiences or environment to affect first impressions",1
"I meet a friend, he was go to school and work in the same time he was about to out of high school and go to collenge but he maked a bad decision on his life, he about to out of high school but he stop and he said to me that ""go to work are making more money than go to school"" so he stop school, his job now is doing nail that job do sometime do alot of money and sometime don't and he don't want to try more hard, he can go to collnge and later on got a good job make more money than Nail but lose that chance and it change his live forever now he can't take it back. Nobody like to do something that they don't want it, they have their own chose of life decisions on what they want to be or what they want to do.

However, some of the decisions they may have are hard way or easy way, the hard way is they have to try hard in life: study so you can have a good grade and work hard, the easy way is they have to put stuff or money on the first start of they future decisions, is a short way but is really hard and not all people can make that decisions depend on if they want it or not. . Also depend on where they at in life for a example: people have alot of money the way they want their decisions on future is more short because they don't worry about other thing tact or payment and people are not have alot of money the way they start their future decisions are more longer because they have to worry about alot of money tact, payment, pay for their car,... People can make their own decisions because they can do anything they like, something they aready goal on for a long time. They have to desige their own life, work hard so they can have a good life on future and do anything they want. However alot of people don't know what they gonna do in a future, they don't know what they like or interesting job to do on future so they are stuck, they need help to chose their stuff that may interesting them later on in life.

The chose they have and everything that happen around them to make their own future decisions, and all of the support from people around or family can make it more better decisions on their own life. also they have a to work more extra hard for they decisions. If people work hard enough so later on their children can more easy to make their decisions about their own life. So sometime people have to think of what about to happen in their future and desige what they gonna be in future lean on what they have and about to have.

"If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school.. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesn't for that way. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living",0
"People can change in many ways possible you your self just have to decide if that's what you want to do.

In conclusion John Lubbock a British naturalist and politician said that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" and I believe thats true. In other words I believe people choose who they want to be and how they want to act like cause its who they are it's their character. Their are many different types of people in the world and they have their own characters.

Secondly all people are different and special in many ways like people could help others, they could donate their time to help the elderly, they could spend time with loved ones, or they could do bad things like stealing and other stuff like that but that all comes from you, you decide to do all those thing whether good or bad that your traits as a human being.

Last of all people with bad and good traits can change whether you decide to or not its all up to you nobody else's. Once a British naturalist and politician John Lubbock said, ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""and some people believe thats true and I agree with them. I believe that we our self choose our own character traits because no matter who you are influenced by you make your own decisions. Yes, there maybe others who will be in your life time their to persuade you to do bad things but its up to you if you want to stay with those kinds of people.

First of all your character is something that make you,you and thats whether you choose to be good or bad, nice or mean. but its also true that some people some people may influence the way you act like who you grew up with, people who were role model's to you, or people who motivated you in your life time.

"Busch Gardens is one place that I would like to visit. They said that it is a great place for me to visit in the world.

To sum up, I would like to visit Busch Gardens because it is fun, all the rides, and it is a place that I never visit before. The best thing in their is I can spend time with my family.

Next, I would love to try all the rides. I really want to go there because I just heard about it from my friends and other peoples. My friends told me that are a lot of good shops for shopping. Then I would get in the horror house and scare my sister. All my friends always recommend me to go their. . I think Busch Gardens is a magical place to visit. I would love to go there. I want to go there because it is fun, all the rides, and I had never visit their before.

First of all, it is fun to go Busch Gardens. I think it is the perfect place where I should go. Those rides are probably fun than any other thing. If I ever go their I would spend all my savings on buying games and toys. The first thing I would like to do in there is to ride the biggest roller coaster. I heard that their are some good games that I can enjoy. I think it is a good place to visit with my family. Afterward, I would get in that maze and try to solve it.

"Being out at night can be hazardous, and curfews help to keep teens at home or in a safe place. Ultimately, curfews can be effective in curbing teenage activities that could lead to trouble.. 
Curfews and the associated restrictions can play a valuable role in helping teenagers stay out of trouble. With the time provided by curfews, teens can take note of their responsibilities and develop into responsible young adults. Teens can use the extra hours to build stronger relationships with their parents and siblings, or to work on projects in school or in the community. In addition, curfews give teenagers extra time to focus on activities that bring them closer to family and friends",1
"We tend to doubt our own abilities and falter at times when we should persist towards our dreams. 

However, it is never too late to change our destinies. 
Despite the many hurdles we must all face when attempting to achieve our goals, the most significant obstacle we face is often ourselves. We don't often take second chances when the first fails, and instead of taking the advantage of our precious time, we give up. Staying persistent and believing in yourself can make all the difference when it comes to achieving your goals. We must have trust in ourselves and our own abilities, as believing that we can achieve our goals is just as essential, if not more so, than actually doing the hard work.",1
"This can open up new doors of insight and learning that they would have otherwise missed out on. Last year I was involved in a difficult situation with a close friend. With this increased self-knowledge, people are more equipped to handle difficult situations in the future. 

Mistakes often push people out of their comfort zones and encourage them to try something new. I made a mistake in the way I handled it, and felt guilty about it for some time. With a willingness to learn and grow, mistakes can be used not only to gain insight, but also to build resilience and personal growth.. The experience made me realize how my words and actions can affect others, so I made sure that in the future I was more considerate and aware of the needs of others. This can give them the strength they need to overcome any obstacles in their lives. 

I can personally attest to how my mistakes have helped me become a better person. 

Another important benefit of mistakes is that they help people to become more resilient. Everyone at some point has made an error that had a lasting effect. 

In conclusion, mistakes can be difficult to experience, but they can bring out the best in people and help them become better human beings. Although it can be stressful and uncomfortable to make a mistake, it can help a person grow in many ways. 
Mistakes can have a great impact on a person's life, leading them to become better human beings in the long run. When a person makes an error, they may be embarrassed or discouraged at first, but they eventually pick themselves up and learn from what went wrong. It can also help them become more aware of themselves and their place in the world, leading to increased levels of emotional intelligence",1
"Longer school days would give them less time to relax or pursue their own personal interests. 

In conclusion, the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day. This could lead to burnout and cause them to resent their studies even more than they may already. It is essential that students have adequate time to pursue activities that they enjoy and relax.. Teachers would end up assigning more so that students can keep up with the contents covered in school, but this would further overburden students and leave less time for family and personal leisure time. Not only would it be detrimental to students’ mental and physical health, but it would also reduce the amount of free time they have to do other activities, leading to an overall decrease in their quality of life. Not only are students already overworked, but longer school days could have an overall negative effect on their wellbeing. 

Firstly, students have their own lives outside of school. 
School days are already long and that is why the school board should not add an extra one and a half hours to each one. 

Secondly, an increase in the amount of time spent at school would reduce the amount of physical activities students are able to participate in. Mental and physical health are both important, and longer days could lead to students developing an unbalanced lifestyle, which could potentially have serious consequences.

Lastly, having longer school days would lead to an increase in the amount of homework assigned",1
"By having a positive attitude, one can approach challenging situations with optimism and a vision to improve. 
Having a positive attitude is one of the most important factors in determining success in life. It's easy to find examples of people who didn't have a positive attitude and weren't successful in their endeavors. Positivity, security of oneself and acceptance of life’s challenges are all key components of a successful life that can only be accessed when one has a positive outlook. They can also forgive themselves quickly when they make mistakes and be content with their lives no matter what life throws at them.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is indispensable in life. It helps one become emotionally resilient and allows them to use life’s difficulties as learning experiences, while still being optimistic about the future. Numerous studies have shown that those who view life optimistically find greater success in work, relationships and overall life satisfaction. However, many case studies point to the success of those with positive attitudes, who are able to weather life's challenging moments.

Those who tout the benefits of a positive attitude are not wrong. This attitude is necessary for those who value success in any aspect of their life, and those who perceive negative attitudes as more beneficial are simply mistaken.",1

"To effectively implement it, individuals must learn to take personal responsibility for their own actions and develop self-confidence and discipline. . The military mindset, the idea of being self-reliant in order to achieve a common goal, is closely related to this concept. Additionally, acknowledging failure and learning from mistakes is an important part of this concept. 

Self-reliance can have a profound impact on society, leading to increased innovation and productivity. 
Self-reliance has become an increasingly important concept today for individuals, businesses, and communities. It calls for a shift in decision-making from seeking external guidance to using self-reliance and autonomy. Self-reliance is extremely relevant in current events, especially in terms of government shutdowns. By promoting self-reliance, individuals can prioritize their own strengths and be empowered to make their own decisions and take ownership of their lives. It is the act of becoming independent, taking responsibility for one's own decisions, and relying on oneself as opposed to seeking advice or guidance",1
"Achieving a successful connection is all about finding common ground and showing genuine interest in the other person. She researched the interviewer, identified common interest, and prepared thoughtful questions to get the conversation flowing. 

For example, one student was able to change her first impression on an interviewer after an initial conversation went badly. It is also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and should be given chances to redeem themselves. Do not put too much focus or attention into a first impression as it can limit the mutual understanding that comes from further conversation. She made sure to not only remain engaged throughout the conversation, but also demonstrate her knowledge of the field. It's easy to make a first impression, but it can be challenging to change that impression afterwards. 

When navigating a situation like this, one strategy is to find reasons to have a second conversation. 

Finally, although making a positive impression is important, it is also important to remember that it is not everything. This gives another chance to make a favorable impression. People often form impressions of each other within seconds of meeting. 
When it comes to forming relationships, making first impressions is essential. This includes judging things such as clothing, hairstyle, body language, and the tone used in conversation. ",1

Dear principal ,As a student i think we should balance The school menu of healththeir school lunches is a good idea and also a bad idea, the resaon why is when most students don't take care of their own body by eating junk food but most student like their favorite food for example, most students in my class when they eat their favorite food for example pizza, in lunch it will affect their stomach but not only their stomach but they have nothing health besides milk to eat.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken. So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods.

When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body",0
"The students can't forget the computer, pencil, notebook or other things that we use in school, because they have all classes online, this can be positive for the students that stay in home at care to they parents the student can't has some distractions that sometimes has in the school, like talk with any friend, use a inappropriate language to the teacher or don't pay attention, if can be some possibility to the student miss some class; they can take the missing class latter.

In conclusion, take a classes from home is a good choice because stay in home, do not have any absent if are sick, and don't missing class, are a good idea for take classes at home, the benefits that this have are good for parents and students that need to have more family time, or need to have more time with they sons. There are many students that has the possibility to take class at home. This is good for the students because they at final a year has perfect attendance.

Second, the students that take class at home just can be absent, if they need to stay in home and don't take some class, they have the opportunity to explain to the teacher by text or just a call, then the teachers need to ask to your parents if is necessary don't take classes because you don't feels good. The student don't have any excuses for be absent. The students that take class at home are benefit because they don't need to leave from home, they can stay in home if are sick, and they can't be absent, because they always stay in home.

There are many reasons for explain that takes classes from home is a good idea, this are some of them:

First, the students that take class at home don't need to leave from home, nothing can detain take classes. The weather changes don't affect to take a class, if is snowing, raining or are a hurricane in the city.

The parents of the students that take class from home can be more unsuspecting, because they sons are in home, also this is benefit for the parents of students that take classes from home; they can be sure that nothing danger can be happen to they sons. A reason that take classes in the schools take a big part time of students, this is a good choice because the students don't need go to the school just stay in home ,add that, this is a good choice for some students that need to stay in home, with they brothers or they parents.. The students that take a regular classes in the schools can't do this because they need to be in the school everyday , if not in this case the correspondent sub school has the obligation to put absent in the class day.

Finally, the students that take class at home can't missing a class, they don't have the possibility to missing the bus or miss some useful for the school",0
"We may fall into a negative state of mind, become apathetic, and lose touch with reality. Doing so can help us stay positive and find meaning even in the most difficult of times. 

Without hope, we can become disillusioned and neglect the things that matter. It means having faith that things will get better, and that we can learn from our mistakes.

The lessons we learn from life can often be applied to our own lives. We view life as meaningless or hopeless. Having hope in life means that we can look to the future despite any challenges we may face. 
Life is unpredictable and full of uncertainties, and no one likes to fail or face hardships. However, it is important to keep believing in yourself and to have hope no matter what. 

In conclusion, it is essential to keep believing in oneself and to never lose hope in life. Similarly, if we put in the effort to work towards our goals, it can help to cultivate optimism and resilience. We can learn valuable lessons from life that can be applicable to our own lives, and by having hope, we give ourselves the opportunity to have a more rewarding and fulfilling life.. Too much negativity can make it hard to build relationships, and it can start to hinder us from achieving our goals and making progress. For example, if we learn to value the little things in life, then we will be more content and grateful for what we have, not always chasing after material goods or things that don't necessarily bring us happiness",1
"By pushing myself to my limits and rise to the challenge, I would have found a way to develop my skills even further and grow both on and off the field.

The same can be seen in the lives of other athletes. In her own words, “You will never grow unless you are willing to try something new. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote, “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,” rings true in my own life and through studying the experiences of others. We must be willing to solve puzzles, explore past boundaries, and take risks in order to grow and become the best versions of ourselves.. For example, LeBron James has continuously experimented and evolved his game since the day he joined the NBA. As an amateur soccer player, I never took my skills to the professional level, but if I chose to, I would have had to try something far beyond what I had already mastered. 

Likewise, celebrities outside the sports world have also credited their success to embracing challenge. Similarly, Kobe Bryant is also renowned for constantly pushing himself to the limit to become a better player; as a result, he achieved greatness and the opportunity to be gifted with five NBA championship rings. By not shying away from more difficult activities and taking on challenges, he has managed to peak as a four-time MVP and become one of the best players in the game’s history. Taylor Swift is a well-known example; she has moved past her country music roots and released multiple chart-topping pop albums, pushing her career to new heights. Sometimes that means taking risks, and sometimes it means outgrowing your comfort zone.”

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote holds true in our lives",1
"To begin with, when one has a positive attitude, they form a good reputation. It encourages others to see the silver lining in any situation. For instance, when faced with an illness, having a positive attitude may help ease the burden and challenge of the situation. Even when faced with difficulty, one can still strive to be optimistic, and in doing so, help others stay motivated. Additionally, when one goes through a difficult period in their life, staying positive can bring personal growth and new perspectives. 

Real-life examples of the importance of positive attitude are easy to find. With the right attitude, almost anything is possible.. It affects how one looks at life’s obstacles and encourages them to stay hopeful and motivated. 

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is key to a successful and healthy life. In other words, a person with a positive outlook on life is more likely to be seen as trustworthy, since they are open to different experiences and willing to take on challenges. People tend to be drawn to those who have a positive outlook and helping others feel the same can create powerful relationships. Moreover, having a positive attitude can help others around us. It creates a calming energy and healthy relationships. 
Having a positive attitude in life comes with many benefits",1
"By creating their own works, students are forced to explain the idea behind the artwork throughout the entire process. By performing directly in front of an audience, students learn to speak out loud and stand by their own words. 
Studying the arts in school can provide students with invaluable life skills. Not only do students learn the fundamentals of music theory, they also learn to express themselves and communicate through improvisation.

Additionally, drama classes help students practice communication skills and confidence. Such classes can provide the stepping stones to developing successful careers and ultimately achieving personal fulfillment.. Arts such as music, drama, and visual arts not only offer students the opportunity to flex their creative muscles, but they also help students learn to communicate and collaborate effectively.

In music classes, students learn to work together as a team and express complex emotions and ideas. Students are forced to learn the music and understand each other's parts in order to create something beautiful. Additionally, students learn to recognize feedback and take criticism constructively.

In conclusion, classes like music, drama, and visual arts can provide essential life skills to high school students. They also learn to listen to and respond to their peers in a constructive way.

"In addition, even the smallest of changes in behavior or attitude can sway a person to have a different first impression. 
    Over time, people's first impressions of someone can change for a variety of reasons. Factors such as getting to know someone better and forming a better understanding of them can lead to differences in opinion. Getting to know someone beyond their appearance and surface level traits can cause a drastic shift in opinion. One of the most common is simply getting to know someone better. As this understanding develops, any preconceived notions or biases about the individual can fade away, creating an entirely different opinion than the one initially formed. 

In conclusion, first impressions of someone can evolve and differ from the initial one formed over time. 

By interacting with the individual more, a person can form a better understanding of the individual. This could lead to a far different view of the individual from the initial first impression. Therefore, it is important to not rush to judgement in forming these first impressions and be patient in forming a better understanding of someone.. As a person continues to interact with the individual, their perception and attitude about that person can change as a result of new experiences or conversations",1
"Generic_School was one of the school which adopted and follows the model to conserve energy and resources, as a result they were supported in their necessities in this disaster.

Thus, through follow the model by extending the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need it in the community.

Second, conserve energy and resources through the model by extending the school day two hours can be helpfully for the school in emergency situations.

In other words, by extending the school day two hours and conserve energy and resources ,they were supported with this conserved energy and resources in this emergency situation. Thus, conserving energy and resources following the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully way for emergency school situations.

Conversely, some people may claim that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not conserve energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources with this two more hours. For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. In other hands, some people may argue that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not be a conserve form for energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources. Following this model by extending the school day two hours can be method to conserve energy and resources.

To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. This conserve energy and resources could be a way to support the school and the community",0
"It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. An enjoyable educational activity could be playing an intrument,an intrument could teach someone to practice everyday,by practicing could lead you to learning new techniques to play that type of instument. Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. . Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. Being enspired by someone to do that instrumet or what ever you want to do you need somone to motivate you for example, their was this one time where my brother motivated me to play the chello and I did and it felt good,because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around. YouCAn also make friends in the new state you travelled to thats why playing an intrument is so enjoyable",0

When people feel the need to always be working, they can easily become overwhelmed and suffer from burnout. Overall, committing to taking breaks on a regular basis not only allows for increased focus and productivity, but also adds to improved physical and mental health.. I find that not only do I work more efficiently, but I also have more solutions and ideas for the tasks and projects that I am working on. Breaks allow for moments of quiet contemplation and reflection, helping to fuel creativity. Taking breaks not only provides a physical and mental respite, but can also lead to a more positive outcome for the quality of one's work. They can also help to reduce stress levels and improve concentration.

On a personal level, I can attest that taking breaks can be a great support in an always-working mentality. I often take breaks during the day to distract myself from the work, allowing me to come back with a renewed clarity and focus",1
"

However, there are some potential drawbacks to taking one day off of school. 
There are various pros and cons when it comes to taking a day off from school. Ultimately, it really comes down to weighing the pros and cons of taking one day off of school.. While taking a break may be beneficial for some, others may find it detrimental. In addition, taking a break from classes can help conserve resources, such as electricity, as schools can reduce overall energy costs by not providing regular teaching and studying for one day. On one hand, students and teachers may find a break from their often demanding schedules to be beneficial for overall energy and stress levels. On the student side, taking off could cause them to fall behind on their curriculum and potentially create gaps in their learning. Additionally, teachers have to manage the complexities of making sure everyone stays on track with their curriculum and could find additional time off to be challenging.

Overall, deciding whether or not to take one day off of school is a difficult choice that needs to be carefully considered",1
"First impressions are always the most important thing when you meet someone you want them to think good of you so you do your best to make them feel comfortable around you. . You can do a couple of thinks to make them trust you and change their perspective about you: like be kind,ask them about what they like,etc. If you make a bad impression the first time with probably that person It is going to think that you are like that forever. There is no way you can change what others think even when you have not talk to them,people think what they want to think and it is hard to change their thoughts. Start a conversation that makes them feel they can talk with you about whatever they want,however sometimes things like that do not work and simply you just can not change what other people thinks that is why you should try to make a good impression the time you talk with a new person that is the reason why first impressions are important",0
"It can help people talk to people all over the world. All the people can now connect with anyone with just a simple button.

People can call 911 for an emergency. For example my Uncle can't leave the country to go visit his mom but if he does he can't return to the states. So thankfully my dad was there to call 911 for him and saved his life. In fact 70%

of the people around the world can communicate. So if you ever witness an accident call 911 because you might save a life.

Technology does have a positive effect on people. For example my dad had witness a car crash when he was driving to work. The cops came in like 3 minutes. People can also call 911 for emergency. When the cops arrived they quickly got the guy out of his car where he was flipped. My dad once said"" that one day I'll save a life just by calling 911"". Technology today does have a positive effect on people because it can help people communicate with people around the world, and people can call 911 for an emergency.

It helps people communicate with people around the world. So the technology now allows him to Skype or Facetime his mom when he wants. So technology is the best thing humans ever created because it can help anybody do anything.. The reason he said that is that the technology today is better than the one he grew up with. Other people believe that technology is the root of evil, however technology helps everybody no matter what. When he saw the car flipped over he quickly got his phone and called 911. Technology today can do more things than the technology a few years ago. In fact 55% of people that call 911 save a life",0
"Students who are able to explore their interests and learn more about potential career paths will be better equipped to make informed decisions when the time comes. Not only could this put them in a difficult position when it comes to choosing the right path, but it could also potentially lead to them making the wrong choice - one that might not be beneficial to them in the long run.

On the other hand, maturing and gaining knowledge about different careers before making a decision can be highly beneficial. By doing so, they will be in a much better position to make an educated decision, one that is both beneficial and satisfying.. It is much better to allow students the chance to explore and learn more about different career paths before making a final decision. They will be able to consider various options, weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each, and determine which ones are best suited to their individual skills and talents. 
When considering career choices for high school students, it is important to keep in mind the consequences of making the wrong choice and the benefits of exploring. This will give them the opportunity to build a career that is both meaningful and fulfilling.

In conclusion, there are many potential risks associated with requiring students to choose a career when they first enter high school. Requiring students to decide on a career when they first enter high school can lead to many of them feeling overwhelmed, stressed out, and unprepared",1
"They may not have the educational background or internships necessary to enter professional fields. 
As students begin to develop a sense of individual identity, the career paths they pursue change drastically. 

Unfortunately, many adults may view teenagers as too inexperienced or immature to decide on a career. However, this belief fails to acknowledge the reality of the modern world in which teenagers can commit to long-term goals earlier on. Young people can demonstrate the breadth of their experience and knowledge which shows that not all adolescents are the same.

Even with the ambition and drive to pursue a career, teenagers still face unique challenges. Elementary school students are typically unaware of the concept of a long-term job and tend to approach career choices from a more whimsical perspective. This age group may also begin to explore the creation of a resume and the development of professional skills. On the other hand, middle school students start to recognize the consequences of their decisions and may begin to commit to a career path. Ultimately, committing to a career at a young age requires the willingness to learn and the patience to maneuver through an ever-changing landscape.. Moreover, due to their age, there are limits to the degree of responsibility they can take on",1
"Furthermore, collaborative activities such as ensemble performance and group theatres can help students gain important interpersonal skills such as teamwork and leadership that are beneficial for college and professional endeavors.

By taking art, music, and drama classes, students can gain an in-depth understanding of the various aspects of these creative pursuits. Knowledge learned in these classes such as how to read and interpret music, create and understand art, and perform and interpret a dramatic script can be useful for college and job applications. Additionally, taking art, music, and drama classes can help improve a student's academic performance, as research has shown that students who participate in creative activities tend to score higher on tests, think more critically, and have better problem solving skills.

In addition to academic performance, taking art, music, and drama classes can provide students with practical skills and knowledge that are beneficial for college and career prospects. Therefore, a persuasive essay about why students should take art, music, and drama classes could include the following points: the development of creativity, the potential for improved academic performance, the gain of practical skills and knowledge, and the opportunity to explore various creative pursuits in a safe and structured environment.. By engaging in creative activities such as painting, writing music, or performing on stage, students acquire skills that go beyond the traditional academic curriculum and can help them become more creative thinkers. This knowledge can be applied to various aspects of their lives, such as studying, developing creativity, and providing them with the opportunity to pursue their interests in a safe, structured environment. 
One of the greatest educational benefits of taking an art, music, or drama class as an elective in school is the development of creativity",1

"I think we can't compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work.

To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school don't have to follow,

First,

we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and that's not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students.

Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school.

Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things,

so they will not have time and that's will be a reason why they can left the school.

Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time.

Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they can't do all.

People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week.

Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit.

One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off.

Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they don't have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do.

students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn.

Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do.

all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day.

In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages . As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages .

I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change. ",0
"Without the opportunity to make a decision of their own free will, teenagers will have limited control over their own future. This can lead to decreased engagement in their academic pursuits, feelings of powerlessness and insecurity, and impair their ability to explore interests that may lie outside of the predetermined options. Ultimately, when schools control students' careers, it can prevent them from fully expressing their own individuality and achieving their full potential.. 
Excerpt: 

When schools choose students' careers for them before they reach the age of making the choice themselves, the impact on the students can be far-reaching and profound. Furthermore, this practice may lead to greater levels of stress and anxiety for students as they are expected to perform in an unfamiliar area without having chosen it for themselves",1
"Being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. When learning new skills it can make your ability improve. The people that can do more, they have a better advantage because they can do more that others can't do. When someone knows so many skills, they could probably teach another person that wants to be like you. . Imagine someone is doing the same skill that he already has mastered, he is going to stay in the same place. He will never grow. Also, someone can even find out new sports or skills that they never thought they could do. Its pretty shocking that there are people that don't know that they could do something that they never thought they could do.

In conclusion, someone can make themselves even stronger than what they are now. When someone finds out more things that they are able to do, it can help them join in more activities. Learning new skills can help someone out a lot. One reason why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. Someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Is a great thing to be able to improve your ability.

Finally, someone can even find out if they are good at other things that they probably never thought they would be good at. Someone is going to start realizing their improvement and once they start seeing results, they are going to start getting motivated even more. Once you become a strong person are you going to be able to do anything.

Next, being able to learn new skills can improve your ability. Is the best to try to do new things than staying in the same place and never growing.

First reason, why doing different things can help someone grow is by being stronger in other things. When being strong or good at things, you can even help your friends if they are struggling. Finding things that someone never knew they could do will make someone pretty shocked. When doing a lot of new things it can make someone a healthier person. Being stronger in other things can really put you to the top where you never thought you could be at. When getting stronger at other things it could make someone the best athletic person or the best person that is strong in so many things",0
"With a 10 p.m. Even worse, the curfew may be seen as an invitation for teenagers to break the law, thus leading to further crime and legal issues. Furthermore, research suggests that teenagers’ brains may be wired to operate better when they receive sufficient amounts of sleep. 
Adopting a 10 p.m. curfew, concerned guardians can be more relaxed about knowing that their children are getting enough rest and are safe at home. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is a somewhat divisive issue, as it has both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, after-hours access to teenage hotspots would be restricted, and fewer late-night incidents involving minors would be reported. 

Overall, it is important to weigh the positives and negatives of imposing a citywide curfew for minors in order to make an informed decision about its adoption.. Furthermore, the enforcement of this curfew may be difficult and costly. Teenagers could also be discouraged from engaging in extracurricular activities and after-school programs that might satisfy their educational and/or creative needs, since these activities often run past 10 p.m. 

On the other hand, implementing a curfew could be perceived as the city council being overbearing and intrusive to the lives of minors, violating their freedoms and liberties",1
"I have known how it felt to be miserable, dependent, be rejected, to count on someone, to fail again and again.

Even though I did not go to college, I am proud of myself. But, I had this opportunity because my mother made the impossible become possible. She is my model. My mother do not know how to read just because her parents were poor. I will not say I am the ""Albert Einstein'' of this generation but, I am intelligent , fast learner, humble and cooperative. Responsible and hard-worker people are the top choosen. "" I graduated high school with advanced diploma. Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. I can read, write, and speak not only one language but, 3 different ones.

I have learned to offer the better side of me in anything I am doing. As she always said, '' Je me leve a l'aube du jour et m'endorme apres le couche du soleil pour que tu sois fiere de toi meme, et sois capable d'aider les gens comme moi. In my country, Haiti, school is very expensive and not accessible for everyone. Because she was a hard-worker. My mother died. She did not have the chance to see the fruit of her hard-work.

I want to make her pride from where she is. A trustworthy person who can help the team be better and cooperate positively.

No employer would hire someone who can't be at work in time, someone who always finds excuses to stay at home, someone who can't accept to be wrong.

I remember the way I was raised. I might not be the most experienced person for this work, but I am a good candiade.. Employers need to know that they can rely on this person in rough time",0
"Elective courses offer students a way to express their interests and figure out what they truly desire. 
When it comes to deciding whether to take college classes or enter the military at an early age, it is important for students to consider all of their options and make an informed decision. Ultimately, taking the time to evaluate all of one's options is key to making an informed decision.. Elective courses provide students with the opportunity to explore their interests and learn what they truly desire, gain knowledge on diverse topics, and gain valuable skill sets. 

Through elective courses, students are able to explore different topics and open themselves to new possibilities. These courses offer a chance to learn about diverse areas, including the arts, American history, and science. While a quick decision may seem like the best option, rushing into a decision often leads to regrets in the long run. As a result, students will be better prepared for whatever career they plan to pursue. By trying out different courses, students can deepen their understanding of their preferred subject and gain an insight into potential future paths. By taking elective courses outside of a student's comfort zone, they can gain vital skills such as creativity and problem-solving. 

To sum up, students should not rush into deciding which college classes to take or enter the military at an early age. 

In addition, elective courses can provide a new perspective on the complex world around us",1
"Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesn't give you any bad day or anything like obviously you don't want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. People love doing their favorites things where it will keep them safe and healthy. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. It's important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so that's why you should go outside and play with your friends.

In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesn't give you a stress. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we don't talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed.

To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you haven't been. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. it's important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so that's the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends.

In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. I just couldn't focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. There a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it.           . I didn't have any stress after in 2016. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing",0
"Online classes, i think that if students really trying to learn something is not need for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach al the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every class room, and i think that online classes are not a bad idea because they been teach by a computer and they have to pay attention or they will fail, but at school they wont fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and thats how they will pass classes better at school then online .

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",0

"When we have an optimistic attitude about the process, we feel more positive about the interview and our chances of landing the role. On the other hand, if we take on a pessimistic attitude and focus on scenarios where we may fail, we become more apprehensive and inhibited about the whole process, killing our chances of success even before we’ve started. When we have a positive outlook, our brains become more oriented towards problem-solving, creative solutions, and success. In essence, a positive attitude is a differentiator for success in life. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. Not only does having a positive attitude enable us to see these opportunities, but it also gives us the motivation and confidence to take advantage of them.

To illustrate this, consider the example of applying for a job. It is, therefore, vital for us to maintain an optimistic and motivated outlook if we want to make the most out of our life endeavors.. When we approach situations with a positive attitude, our minds become open and creative, allowing us to see all of the potential opportunities that await us. Likewise, when studying for an exam, having a positive attitude enables us to stay focused on the task and to believe in our ability to remember the material.

The power of having a positive attitude goes beyond just making us feel better in the short-term. We appear more professional and confident to the interviewer, thereby increasing our chances of success",1
"For example Generic_Name is a student from Generic_School, Generic_Name and his friends in their freshman year aimed for the advanced diploma in his school, but Generic_Name aimed for the standard diploma, his friends bought that by choosing the advanced diploma would be easier to earn credits and graduate faster, but little did they know they would get challenging classes, having almost AP classes in almost every material, Generic_Name from the other side having his standard diploma resulted him having normal classes and passing almost all of them. Sometimes it is better to achieve your goal and do not try to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself because at the end what really matter in this life it is to achieve your goal.

Lastly, aiming low is a representation of honesty, and humility. Once The great artist Michelangelo said that

""The grater danger for most of us lies not only setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"". I personally disagree with this because not all of us people really wants to more than what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. People took Generic_Name as en example of not doing more of what it is asked to do in their jobs.

Secondly, what really matters in this life is to achieve your goal. Some people may say that this may agree with Michelangelo's said, because sometimes getting out of our comfort zone it is what most of us should do; challenge our selves to get even higher expectation and results, but to be realistic not all of us aims for that.

First of all, most of us do not really wants to do more than it is asked to do. For example, Generic_Name have a Mexican restaurant, she does not aspire her restaurant to be the greatest in her town, but what she really aspires for her restaurant is to keep her with the same love and passion she has for cooking and the satisfaction of her clients. At their junior year Generic_Name's friends decided to change their diplomas because their classes was so difficult that their credits was not high enough, Generic_Name had the needed credits to be considered a graduate. Not all the people wants to more what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. For example, Generic_Name a orange contractor, he has been asked from his boss to fill 10 trailers of orange per day, one day he filled 12 trailers of oranges and thought that his boss would pay him the 2 trailers extra of orange that Generic_Name and his worker filled, in his paycheck did not appear the 2 extra trailers of orange causing Generic_Name pay his workers for the extra hours and work that they had putted, Generic_Name never again did more of he was asked to do. Not always setting our aim too high and falling short it is what it means to survive in this world.. Aiming low does not mean that is going to be a failure, but if you do it with honesty and humility, the 'danger' will not be as big as it appears.

As you can see, Michelangelo's said its not all the way truth because, people from all over the world thinks differently, having different experiences in their lives causing them to disagree on his said",0
"For example, it is imagination that successfully takes a concept from inception to reality. However, knowledge is essential for refining ideas to turn them into tangible solutions. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."" By combining imagination and knowledge, both individuals and society can develop solutions and build positive change. 

Albert Einstein also saw the power of a child’s imagination first-hand, noting how it could inspire innovation and creativity. He said, “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.” However, if this imagination is not nurtured in a positive way, it could have the opposite effect and ultimately stunt the development of a child’s creativity. 
Albert Einstein was a firm believer in the importance of imagination and knowledge in equal measure. Fear can often be used to control children, either directly or indirectly, and this can lead to the repressing of their imagination. He said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge. Therefore, it is essential to nurture and nourish a child’s imagination rather than frightening them.",1
"If an individual lacks knowledge about any subject, it takes much more effort to achieve the same results. 
Knowledge is paramount to success in life in a variety of ways. In addition, having knowledge gives people the capacity to respond quickly to changes that occur in their professional or personal lives. Knowledge can help people develop problem-solving skills, make informed decisions, understand the world around them and build a successful career. Ultimately, knowledge can help people create projects or assist others in ways that wouldn't be possible without it.. With knowledge, an individual can identify their interests, develop skills and make decisions with confidence. By having a fundamental understanding of a wide range of subjects, an individual can come up with innovative ideas to create projects or help others. 

For instance, applying knowledge may include developing a computer application or robotic system to assist a disabled person in performing everyday tasks. For example, people who know how to effectively use a computer, social networks or any other forms of digital communication will have more opportunities to make and build meaningful relationships with their peers. 

Ultimately, knowledge is essential to success in life",1

tell me this when someone is kind to you. I think more people should start being kind to other. you feel happy right knowing that someone cared to do that thing for you when your being kind to other they feel the same feeling as you do knowing that someone cares about you. volunteer help people if something happened to their homes volunteer help people for no pay they are being kind. It can effect people in a good way by lighting up their day or just talking to people helps them. that all my reason that people should that being kind to others. I hop you liked it. picking up trash can help the earth that why no matter how small act of kindness it is' it can still have a big impact on someone day. when your stuck on the homework you ask your friends for help there being kind enough to help you. this is all my reason kindness is never wasted and how it can come back to and how it effect people and how it helps them and why you should do it. how kindness can help you is when your car turns off when your in the road people will come and try to help you that's kindness they were kind to come and help you. and when people show kindness it usually comes back to them in any forms like a person give you a bag of chip because that person was feeling kind. Doing small act of kindness can really help people by if they lost money and you found it and you gave it back that helps them or you clean their car for them that could mean a lot to the person,0
"On the other hand, working alone has its own advantages as well, as it allows for quicker decision making, fewer delays, and complete autonomy over the project. Group members can help to share the workload, bring different skill sets and perspectives to the project, and may even offer encouragement and support. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the project goals and the individuals involved.. Projects can be complicated by conflicting opinions and ideas, communication issues, and the challenge of managing a cohesive team. 
Working with a group has several distinct advantages. In contrast, working alone carries the risk of project stagnation, limited resources, and a greater challenge in staying motivated.

Overall, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the project and the team. 

However, a group experience also carries some distinct disadvantages. Working with a group may be a better fit when tackling a complicated project, while a small project may be best suited for working alone",1
"
First impressions may not always be accurate because they are based on limited information that is often incomplete or inaccurate. To counteract this, it is important to take a step back and consider these snap judgments in a larger context. Consider the possibility of being open minded and looking for evidence to support or contradict initial impressions. Additionally, taking the time to really get to know someone can help to form more accurate impressions that go beyond first glance.. Our brains are hardwired to make split-second decisions about people and situations, so these first impressions can be the result of any number of factors such as socio-economic status, gender, age, or physical appearance",1
"Not participating in typically senior years activities such as prom, senior trips, or senior lock-ins can be disappointing for these students. 
As the challenges of graduating high school in three years become more established, we need to be aware of the potential issues and how we can best address them. Being in advanced classes also put pressure on students to keep up with their studies and peers at a more accelerated pace.

In order to battle these issues, it is important for students to be well prepared for college. For those experiencing financial difficulty, seeking financial aid or applying for grants and scholarships is a great way to help cover college expenses. Additionally, for students who are looking for more immediate relief, there are alternative options available, such as taking college classes while still in high school or taking a gap year between high school and college. They should actively participate in extracurricular activities, and take advantage of on-campus support services such as mental health counselors, academic advisors, and mentors. 

Overall, it is important for students graduating high school in a condensed timeframe to be aware of the potential issues they could face, but also possible solutions. Many students who finish high school in a condensed timeframe may struggle with the adjustment to college life. With ample preparation, support, and alternative options, students can still achieve their post-secondary dreams.",1

As the threat of global warming becomes more imminent, it is increasingly important to find ways to conserve energy and resources. In addition, government regulations and other initiatives may result in higher costs for businesses and consumers in the short term.

To effectively conserve energy and resources, it is essential to have a plan.

Examples of such plans include providing incentives for energy-efficient appliances and vehicles, incentivizing renewable energy production, and encouraging public transportation. It should strive to reduce waste and promote energy efficiency. There are numerous benefits associated with conserving energy and resources. Together, these measures will help ensure we have a sustainable energy and resource system for the future.. This plan should incorporate existing and emerging technologies, as well as economic and political factors.

"The family can become a primary source of positive influence during a person's formative years, providing an important framework for building important character traits such as compassion, communication, dependability, honesty, and self-confidence. We must be mindful of the balance between taking advice from those around us in order to improve our character, while at the same time not allowing the opinions of others to override our own. Ultimately, it is through our own choices that we form our individual character traits and values.. Our character is shaped not only by the advice we take from those around us, but also from those we interact with on a day to day basis. It can lead to broken relationships, blocks on professional advancement, and loopholes in our moral compass.

Growing up in a close-knit family, I was taught very early on the importance of responsibility, hard-work, reliability, and the importance of working well with others. I was taught life lessons about the value of these qualities through the examples that were set by my parents and siblings. This experience taught me the value of effort and how no matter how difficult a task is I can achieve success if I work hard and don't give up. My parents always made sure that I was able to help out around the house with chores and errands while making sure that I was able to excel in my studies. 

One of my favorite life lessons came in high school when I had to stay up late to study for a major test. At first, I was tired and wanted to give up, but my parents encouraged me to push through and I ended up doing very well on the exam. This simple lesson has remained with me ever since and continues to motivate me to strive for success in all areas of life, including this potential job opportunity.",1
"Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose",0
"Also students use cellphones to take videos, or photos that they want to search in their social media or just for have fun.

Cellphone it can be used for other things, for text with friends or, play games during classes, for watch videos during class, listen to music and not listening on what the teacher is saying. In my opinion cell phones should not be allow to used it the classroom because students use cellphones all day and do no pay attention, cellphones it can be used for other things, and cellphones distract you.

The students use the cellphones all day and do not pay any attention during class is really bad for students because, they come to school to learn and not be in their cellphones.           . PROPER_NAME

"Everyone has different values and experiences that shape the person they become, and it is important to take the time to recognize how these elements create who we are.. They shape our conscience and give us direction in moments of doubt or struggle. People from different social classes may have different sets of morals and values due to their different upbringings and backgrounds. For example, someone who grew up in a wealthy family may have a different view of debating than someone who was raised in a low-income household. In essence, morals are the compass of our lives which leads us in making good character decisions.

Class also plays a role in how a person's character is formed. For example, a moral principle such as not stealing can discourage a person from taking shortcuts or engaging in other criminal activities. As an individual's life progresses, these characteristics take on different meanings and meanings, ultimately contributing to personal growth, identity, and decisions. Moreover, they learn from the example of the people around them and can learn how to handle different situations and what to expect when in different scenarios.

In conclusion, morals, social class, and people are all key contributors to the formation of a person's character. In addition, they inform us of our beliefs, attitudes, and preferences. 

Morals are the values that we have developed throughout our lives and that guide us in decision making. 
Moral values and social classes play an integral role in the formation of a person's character. People who are surrounded by positive and strong influences in their lives tend to have higher self-esteem and are less susceptible to acting prematurely or rashly. How one perceives these different codes of conduct dictates one’s character.

"Modern technology has improved the quality of life of people, especially those who lead an active lifestyle by increasing the range of activities available to them. 

Finally, technology has also had an impact on time management and lifestyle changes. On the other hand, technology has made it easier for people to become absorbed in entertainment and social media, resulting in a decrease of focus on more important topics or educational activities that require more in-depth engagement. A great example of this is the development of specialized physical training software and devices, such as fitness trackers and sports gear, that can be used to chart progress and set goals for athletes of all levels.

On the other hand, technology can also have a harmful effect on physical health. With so much time spent on devices and screens, people are becoming increasingly sedentary, leading to obesity and other physical health issues. While technology provides numerous positive effects for our lives, it also has numerous negative consequences. However, technology can also lead to distraction and over-dependence – people can become overwhelmed by the vast number of tasks and end up spending an excessive amount of time on their devices trying to stay on top of their workload. On one hand, technology has made learning easier and more accessible by providing access to educational material and resources at any time and any place. 
Technology has become an integral part of modern life with its presence felt everywhere from the workplace to the home. 

One of the major positive impacts of technology is the ability to enhance physical growth. Additionally, encouraging physical activity and setting aside time for self-care activities such as reading and playing sports can help people discover a healthier lifestyle.. 

Technology also has a notable impact on learning, both in terms of the quantity and quality of the learning experience. 

In order to reap the benefits of technology while mitigating the negative impacts, it is important to set boundaries and practice healthy device usage. Technology can help people become more productive with tools such as online calendars and task management apps. Limiting the use of phones, tablets, and computers to certain times, or utilizing digital wellness solutions such as screen time trackers, can help people find the right balance between technology and their other interests and activities. Additionally, the development of gaming technology has been linked to a decrease in physical activity among children, which can have a negative effect on their overall growth and development",1

The truth of Churchill’s quote is that success is not always guaranteed, and failure is a natural part of the process. Winston Churchill’s quote, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,” conveys the idea that an individual’s enthusiasm and perseverance will be what helps them learn from failure and succeed.

The idea that failure can be an aid in the pursuit of success is one based on the notion of an individual using their failures to fuel further growth and success. With trials and tribulations, and a belief in oneself, success can be achieved.. It is through failure that an individual can discover what works and matters, and have the determination to move forward despite not having the outcome they had initially planned for. 

The success of an individual is not only determined by the number of successes they accumulate, but also by their willingness to try new opportunities even after failure. The process of learning from failure can be a long and difficult one, but the fact that the individual is pushing past rejection and disappointment to continue to work towards success should be recognized. 
When it comes to seeking success, it is often assumed that the journey itself is what will ultimately determine if an individual is successful or not. Ultimately, these personal successes can lead to even higher achievements, and a greater chance of the individual reaching their goals. Rather than giving up when faced with rejections and defeats, an individual should focus on trusting the process and using every obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow. No one starts out knowing how to achieve success; instead, they learn from their mistakes and use them to drive future decisions",1

For not follow the direction and not make good choice can lead problem. People talk more then one person because they may need help and solve the problem.             . A advice can help people make other people do the right thing.

Just one people can not make a good choice but more people can. Advice does'n mean bad people do it and can be good people even kids because kids sometime do silly and act bad at school.

Advice is a good thing to make choice and it good for school so kid can make better choices. They can take ideas. But people don't allow talk to more then 1 people they can talk to one people if they feel good about. Advice could be safe too. So those people need advice for what can happen and what the better things. For example if their was a bad guy and he keep staling money he need the better thing so a he can make a better choice so that how advice works. People can choice their opinion for what thing can make then better. They will make a better choice what will they do and not doing bad choice like, staling money, selling drag. Kids need advice too. Pick the best that work for you, and that how advice work so people can make better choice like picking the right for them. Sometime people can make silly choice like selling drag or taking money on someone",0

On the other hand, rushing through the final year courses could leave students without a fundamental understanding of certain subjects, making them less competitive for higher education and specialized job opportunities. Taking electives throughout high school could open up more possibilities for students after graduation; they can explore fields of interest that they might not have had time to consider previously. They might also miss out on important experiences such as joining clubs, engaging in extra-curricular activities and finding study buddies to help them grasp complex topics. 

With the implementation of a three year high school program, students have the unique opportunity to graduate with their peers after only three years of study and dedicate the fourth year to plan for their future. 

Overall, taking the option to graduate high school in three years is a personal decision that depends on a student’s academic abilities and goals. While it certainly offers a unique opportunity for students and their families, care must be taken to ensure that they are reaching their academic potential and have access to the same tools and resources as a four year program to ensure success.",1
"It will make them productive and helpful on doing works. Some older and younger students like to be anti social but if they join the program and work together than it will make them social. Usually, younger students don't like to talk to the older students, so it can make them be more confident to talk to others. Like I said, it will also help them both improve on how they used to treat other peoples. It could make a good change on how they used to do their chores and homeworks. . Therefore, many younger students have less experience than the older students, so the older students have more experience than them. It will help them to speak a good langauge and be nice to the people they don't know. Therefore, it could be a great program for the school to start and earn money. Also, it has a great effect on them to be a good students. Also, it will have a good impact on their future when some students will like to a teacher when they grow up and teach their students about behaviors.

In the conclusion, this program could be really helpful for both of them. Also, it will lead them to be a good students and a good person when they grow up. what do you think about a program that school provides to pair the younger students with the older students? It can be a exellent choice for the younger students and the older students. They both can get some useful knowledge that it might be helpful for them to take care of their responsibilities. It could be great and wonderful to learn the things that the students have been struggling in. Also, it will effect them in good way to make some new friends.

Therefore, this program will also help both the older and younger students in improving behaviors. Taking care of responsibilitis is hard but if they work together than it will get more easier and better on it. Like I said, it will also be useful for their future, when they will have job and other things to do.

however, this program could help both the older and the younger students in socialization. Older student have already halfway done going to the school. This program could develope their minds in a good way that will impact their future and their daily life. It will make a great change on how they used to work in group. If the older students are not respecting and talking polite with others than it will change them. It could effect both of them to learn something new that they have not know about yet. This program would help both the older and the younger student in responsibilities, socialization and improving behaviors.

Certainly, this program could help both the older and the younger student in taking care of their own responsibilities. It will make a good impact in spending time with others and playing outdoor games",0
"In most student's summer time,they learn different things from their break,such as work experience,new knowledge from a book,and tradition about other country;In this cause,teacher's designed is not a good choices for student's project,because teacher can not make suitable choices for students,so the way can help students more understand about what they can do in the summer project is student's designed.

When the summer break start,student can make a lot choices about their plan in the summer,for example,they can stay home,travel to somewhere,or work at some place they like;Most student's summer break have a lot different,they learn different things from their break,teacher could not really know what happen in student's break,this is why student need designed their own title.

In half way of the summer,some student might not even start making their project,in this cause if teacher give student a hard title,such as""after you read this book,what your opinion and what you learn from this book?"",then student have try rush through the book,and start making a project,it will make student have a bad project content,if student can decide they own project title,such as""base on your break,what you learn from your travel,it can be anywhere"",if student can create their own project title,it will be a lot interesting and easy.

Most student want to learn a new things from interesting activity,and spend a time on those things,and student always know what whey like to do,they can create title base on animals,vehicles,or their life experience,it will be so much fun and efficiency will improve,if they can decide their own project title.

Between teacher's designed and student's designed,student always like to make their own choices,they can learn things from activity they are interesting,talk and share experience with their friends,and have a easy project in their summer time,that's why student's designed better then teacher's designed.",0
"Three, online classes save students more time and money.

Many students can't be at school for many reasons, for example the student can be sick or injured. Students can save that money for gas and do something else with, for example they can pay bills with that money or even they can support they're family with money. And it can prevent people from getting sick too.

Online classes are easier because, students can take the class at anytime they want and do what every they want do after the class. The students can do whatever they want to after taking the class on online ( spreading time with family and having fun).

THE END....... In some cases the student can have family ''(kids and wife)'' and online classes can help the student to spread more time with his/her family.

In conclusion,

schools offering distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. For example Students get a job and make some money to pay for school fees and bills and also they can support their family with the money. Generic_Name

ONLINE CLASSES ARE BETTER THAN GOIING TO SCHOOL.

Talking online classes are way easier and better then attending/going to school. Because driving to school everyday is a waste of gas, money and time. Students will get more time to get they're work done on time and also save money for them self. Two, online classes help to students to take class at anytime they want . If students get this opportunity to take their classes online, ''I'' think it will be a good idea and they will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, Because Many students can't be at for many reasons,they can be sick or injured. Also online classes makes it easier for students who have jobs and the same time going/attending school.

Moreover, online classes can save students some money and time.    . So the student getting the opportunity for taking or getting his/her work done on online classes will make it easier for the student, instead of students going to school when they're sick or Injured. Some schools offer distance leaning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This opportunity will help students in so many ways. So a sick student can stay at home and get his/her work done so they wouldn't be to spread the sickness or the disease around the school. And they can take the class after work or before work on online",0
"It also allows students to better reach their educational goals, providing an extra layer of guidance and encouragement in improving their skills and understanding complex concepts. For one, it helps them improve their grades, giving them the opportunity to receive support from tutors and peers in tackling difficult material. Finally, with the help from the club, students are less likely to forget assignments, allowing them to stay on top of their studies and remain organized.. 
Having an after school homework club offers significant advantages to students in their academics",1
"Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 don't do anything. In some cases some students don't let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they don't need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work.

Students often don't really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Sometimes in life we want everything but sometimes we have to earn them all by ourselves not with someones help but our own help.. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. Students sometimes don't even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. For example some students don't like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so it's best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they don't have to fail the class. Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students can't think about. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do. If I was to explain to my teacher if I prefer to work in groups or work alone, I would pick work alone. In my opinion I think it's best for students to work alone then to be working in group",0
"Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people don't do it . If you have a positive attitude that can make you a better person or successful for yourself and other people.. But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they don't pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and that's why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

In conclusion,in this three examples I give reasons that why I agree or desagree with the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life"". Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you.

Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . There are three examples about if I agree or desagree about the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life"". I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons.

Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it . If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person.

Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person ",0
"The group help to students to learn and combine new thought from other students. the change of ideas always will be a good work and the can support your reasons, why you had make it.

Work in group include: less work, time, and money, back to work alone you have your own words, spend a lot of your time more than you think, also could take too much time to finish. Friends can help to get a correct answer or do a good work.

The important of groups is that students learn to share, help, and be kind with other students make a friend, besides that learn, help, and teach to other, they make fun their work. In my opinion is more beneficial working in groups that show us compare, analyze, and be friendly with others.. If people who like work by their self can't support ideas with reasoning, can't do a perfect project. Groups have the most of attention in this case. About work alone, I'm not agree, because you try to do something, maybe that's good, but you're not count with other ideas, expressions, or declaration of other thought. Sometimes work alone can be a good choice, because is you're wrong, you can't blame to nobody.

In conclusion, I believe that groups are more helpful for students, because they learn to take other decision and compare. A group of students have skill to take decisions, there're a lot way to do, students can react to any problem, but work alone can be good as a group, people who like work alone have abilities: reasoning, recognize, and expression. Groups were created to share ideas. work alone give stress and that show someone who want to make everything by his\herself they share their own ideas. Therefore, it's not bad get help from other people, everyone say, "" two head think better than one.""

Groups make different way to share or send a message, a few people can create a lot, base in their share of thoughts, abilities, and decisions. Elsewhere, work alone is base in just you, and what you know, if something that you did it, come to be wrong, you will not share it. To different of groups students can do other activities",0

The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said, ""No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.""

Small acts of kindness can have an impact on othes because, if you do something good, if you do something important, if you help somebody.

First, small acts of kindness can have an impact on others if you do something good like give food to somebody the it's hungry the person in going to be impoact because you are doing something important something the others didn't do.

Second, small acts of kindness can have an impact on others if you do something important like yake care of something.

Third, small acts of kindness can have an impact on others if you help somebody like help a person save her work for the person her work it's importat the person it's going to be impact if you help her and save her work.

Is not important how small or biger are acts kindness the importnat the you are diing the things you are helping others you are doing something good for others and thats the important thing",0
"It means having faith that things will get better, and that we can learn from our mistakes.

The lessons we learn from life can often be applied to our own lives. We view life as meaningless or hopeless. 
Life is unpredictable and full of uncertainties, and no one likes to fail or face hardships. Doing so can help us stay positive and find meaning even in the most difficult of times. 

Without hope, we can become disillusioned and neglect the things that matter. However, it is important to keep believing in yourself and to have hope no matter what. Too much negativity can make it hard to build relationships, and it can start to hinder us from achieving our goals and making progress. 

In conclusion, it is essential to keep believing in oneself and to never lose hope in life. Having hope in life means that we can look to the future despite any challenges we may face. We can learn valuable lessons from life that can be applicable to our own lives, and by having hope, we give ourselves the opportunity to have a more rewarding and fulfilling life.. For example, if we learn to value the little things in life, then we will be more content and grateful for what we have, not always chasing after material goods or things that don't necessarily bring us happiness. We may fall into a negative state of mind, become apathetic, and lose touch with reality. Similarly, if we put in the effort to work towards our goals, it can help to cultivate optimism and resilience",1
"Four years students they are more ready for the decision and they are have more time to think about what and where they will be in their future, and they got all help from teacher and parent to help that think in mind steady.

Students are mostly don't finish high school three years they have less experiment about college then students who are three years high school, however the three years high school students have more problem then a four years high school students, three years high school students maybe on the time they thinking what they doing next if they can't make it or they are changes they carrer they end up stay with their parent forever into they know what to do next and on the time they off school the those student going to forget everything that they had learn in school and end up failing.

My opinions is every students need more time to think about their carrer in future, before step forward into their life they needs more time to think and do whatever they need in every class and think for their carrer.. A students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early is a bad idea, maybe have a lot of problem after they are finish high school for three years.

However, finish high school in three years is a good thing to think about it, students will move faraway and move on their life, but that are a small group of students who are thinking one way of their life after three years high school, but the other group of students are have a problem after they finish high school and they need help to resolve the problem they are in. For the students who are have problem need help to resolve, they problem are they making more decision that let they think about can the students do it or can the students sure about this decision or that decision, because is a big decision to change one person life and it happen to every students even the greatest student.

Three years students don't have enough time to think more about their future and not 100% sure about they really are in future, have a lot of students who are finish three years high school and have a good jobs or have a good place to live, not everyone the same life so some students before finish three years of high shool know what they are doing and after high school they making other decision",0

"Rather than simply giving up, however, this student could use the failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. It can also be a chance for us to gain perspective and become more resilient to disappointment and challenging times. 

In both personal and professional contexts, failure can be an important part of paving the way to success. This is especially true for students striving for academic excellence. Take for example a student struggling in a science class. It can be a great learning tool if viewed with the right perspective. 
When it comes to success, failing can often be one of the most valuable learning tools. By working through our failures, we can build confidence in our abilities to eventually achieve success.  Instead of letting failure be an obstacle, use it as an opportunity to reflect and to create a stronger and more resilient foundation for success.. When we fail, we can look at the experience as an opportunity to explore other paths and develop more effective strategies. By engaging with the material more closely, gaining a deeper understanding of the science concepts, and finding creative ways to approach the material, the student can ultimately find success in the class. 

Ultimately, failure is inevitable, but that does not mean it has to be a negative or discouraging experience. This student may not have understood certain concepts or had difficulty understanding the subject matter, which resulted in a lower grade on a recent test",1
"For example, healthier versions of macaroni and cheese, pizza, and taco dishes can be created that retain the traditional flavor profile while providing a nutrient-rich meal. Additionally, school lunches should be prepared in a safe and hygienic manner, with kitchen staff following best practices of sanitizing and cooking food thoroughly. This can be achieved by including more fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as wholesome whole grains, lean proteins, and other healthful components. 
One of the steps that can be taken to make school lunches more enjoyable for students is to serve fresher, healthier foods. The goal should be to provide options that still provide nutritional benefits, without sacrificing the taste and enjoyment for students. 

By taking these steps, schools can create more enjoyable and nutritionally sound lunch options for their students.. 

To address the potential consequence of removing popular items from school lunch menus, alternative foods can be offered as substitutes",1
"Through creative, hands-on learning, students stay ahead in their classes and gain a better understanding of their overall academic performance. It encourages knowledge application, promotes career and academic success, and allows students and teachers the opportunity to cultivate skills they may not possess in the classroom setting.. Through after school programs, students and teachers have the chance to volunteer to help others understand or finish tasks, which not only reinforces their knowledge but also promotes camaraderie and team-building skills. 
After school programs have become increasingly popular for both students and teachers. For teachers, after school programs can provide unique perspectives on certain topics that can be applied in their classroom materials. 

Having an after school program provides crucial insight into real-world scenarios and fosters students’ extracurricular abilities. Not only do they provide students and teachers with the opportunity to learn new material, but they also allow for the chance to gain better grades on quizzes and tests. It presents students with essential leadership and problem-solving skills that help them excel beyond a learning environment. These programs offer the ability for both students and teachers to apply the knowledge they have gained throughout the school day, something that is essential for career and academic success. 

Overall, having an after school program is a beneficial endeavor for both students and teachers",1

"This can also save time by not having to wait in between classes. Students can do their work at anytime they choose and automatically save from having to make a trip from school to home and the other way around. 

On the other hand, a significant disadvantage can be the potential for distractions. From the perspective of those who have taken online classes, the greatest benefit is the flexibility it provides. It is much more difficult for students to stay focused and complete their work when taking classes from home since there could be various distractions such as television, family members, pets, etc. As well, if a student does not have enough motivation, taking classes online can lead to procrastination and be detrimental to learning.. 
Taking classes from home can be an advantageous and time-saving experience for students during these unique times, but it does have its drawbacks",1

Makeup artistry is another creative activity that has a lot of room to experiment with. For example, make sure the hair of the bow is centered and not drooping, and that the bow is parallel to the bridge of the violin.

"The advantages of distance learning for students are numerous, ranging from increased transportation convenience to the freedom to choose between activities. It allows for a more convenient and personalized learning experience, allowing students to tailor their studies to their own needs.. This makes learning more efficient as students can focus for longer amounts of time without the interruption of regular meal times. 

When it comes to transportation, distance learning removes the need for students to travel to a physical class location. Students can continue working for extended periods without the distraction of meals or worries about getting hungry. Additionally, students are free to take classes from anywhere in the world, allowing for great flexibility regarding learning environments. 

Distance learning also helps students streamline their study time, as they don’t have to factor in breaks for food. 

In conclusion, distance learning provides countless benefits for students in terms of transportation, food, and flexible activities. 

In addition, students are given more autonomy when it comes to choosing activities outside of studies. 
Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, allowing students to learn in a convenient and flexible way. Whether it be part time jobs, sports, or other hobbies, distance learning allows students to make the most of their free time. Without the restriction of a literal school time bell telling them when to start and stop studying, students can adjust their work schedules to suit their everyday lives. This can save students money and time, as they no longer have to allocate resources on either commuting or spending hours sitting in a classroom",1
"This is something as simple as a schoolteacher reminding you to be proud of yourself for trying your best on a project, or a parent telling you that they’re proud of the way you handled a problem. Loving and valuing yourself provides the courage to put yourself out there and take risks, which in turn helps create great accomplishments that will shape your future.. These statements may seem small at the time, but they embody an important truth about loving yourself--your accomplishments shape your future.

The importance of loving and valuing yourself and your accomplishments cannot be overstated. 



It is no small feat to be yourself in a world where conformity is rewarded and individuality is often frowned upon. They know that self-love and accomplishment are intertwined, and that accomplishments can provide a stepping stone toward a positive future. Without self-love and courage, it is difficult to make the most of our talents and achieve our dreams. Courage is essential in accomplishing any activity, which makes it a key component of the greatest accomplishment of all--being yourself.

Your parents and teachers have likely reminded you on many occasions throughout your life to embrace yourself and all that comes with it. To love and value yourself is particularly important in light of this situation, as it enables you to bravely strive for your goals and take risks",1
"These resources can help to divert teenagers’ attention away from criminal activities that could lead to trouble. In addition, research has also found that curfews can provide parents with peace of mind, knowing that their children are safe.

There are also activities and resources that teenagers can participate in that will help to keep them out of trouble. 
Studies have shown that enforcing curfews for teenagers can help reduce the likelihood of them getting into trouble. Curfews can help to keep young people in a safe environment and help to provide structure in their lives. Examples of these include sports, community volunteering, after-school programs, and even mentoring schemes which can provide young people with an outlet for their emotions and involvement in constructive activities.

When it comes to schools having local partnerships, there are various risks and rewards involved. 

Successful businesses with local partnerships often create positive, lasting changes within their communities. By exploring these implications and establishing strategies that help students succeed, schools can create an environment that helps young adults to reach their highest potential.. On the other hand, this collaboration requires communication, trust, and a lot of effort to ensure that both parties come away with a positive outcome. On the other hand, benefits of collaboration can include access to mentors and resources, project-based learning opportunities, and more diverse classroom learning experiences. On one hand, schools can benefit from the expertise and resources that companies bring to the table. 

Challenges that come with forming partnerships can range from not understanding the company's values and goals, to different levels of commitment between schools and businesses. 

Through careful consideration and thoughtful partnerships, schools have the potential to become a much needed source of hope and opportunity for students. They can also provide students with a better understanding of the industry and potential career paths they can explore. This can help students stay engaged in their studies and equip them with the skills they need to succeed. The risks and rewards of having a partnership with a local company should be carefully weighed out in order to maximize the benefits for students. Additionally, these partnerships can open doors for students, offering internships and job prospects, while helping the community grow in the process. For example, schools with strong business partnerships may have access to new technologies, mentors, and community resources",1

Allowing students to use their phones during class can bring about many educational benefits which aid in fostering an enriching learning environment. By allowing these students to access their phones in moderation during class, they are able to stay on top of their studies and stay productive. There is no denying that there are certain drawbacks to allowing phones to be used in schools, such as potential for distraction and abuse of technology. 
As our school's principal, I'm sure you are aware of the rising issue of phone usage in classrooms. Furthermore, students can use their phones to snap photos of course materials and diagrams for future reference. Fortunately, I believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage can bring more benefits than drawbacks to our students.

For starters, many students use their phones for organizational purposes, such as setting reminders of upcoming assignments and activities. This will help to promote a more academic and organized atmosphere in our classes.

Additionally, using phones can be a great educational resource. I therefore believe that policy number 1 concerning phone usage is the most beneficial for our students.. Through apps and websites, students have access to a wealth of information which can foster greater student engagement and facilitate more meaningful class discussions",1
"It showed me the power of challenging ourselves and trying something beyond our own abilities.. This is certainly something I have experienced myself. This decision vastly changed the trajectory of my life. After much soul searching and a conversation with a professor in the field, I decided to take the plunge and to invest in developing my math skills. However, I didn't believe that I had the math skillset to pursue this field, and felt that taking it on was a risk too great for me. Upon graduating with my degree in Aerospace Engineering, I realized that it was pushing myself beyond my own limits and doing something I thought was impossible that forced me to grow. This was a true turning point in my life, and an experience I will never forget. For example, when I was in high school, I was interested in pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering. 
I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's assertion that personal growth requires us to challenge ourselves and push past our comfort zones",1
"Furthermore, the lack of an in-person class schedule allows students the opportunity to manage their time more effectively so they can accomplish work-related, educational, and leisure activities.

Despite the many advantages of taking online courses, in-person instruction is beneficial in helping to motivate students and ensure that they are on track to complete their courses. 

Finally, taking online courses enhances skills sought after by employers such as developing self-discipline and time management. Online courses require students to be self-motivated and assume responsibility for their learning, and understanding the material. . Online courses allow students to organisationally plan for assignments, and help develop organizational and problem-solving skills in life and within the workplace. By taking online courses, students can access their course materials any time, any place, as long as they have an internet connection, as well as watch lectures, take exams, and engage in classroom discussions.

In comparison to in-person courses, online courses offer a wide variety of courses and topics that may not be available in a local classroom setting. 
Taking online courses provides students with convenience and flexibility with regards to their educational pursuits",1
"This what makes technology a positive effect on our lives because it makes everything easy.

In conclusion, technology has a positive effect on people lives because we can save time, save lives, and contact people we care about. We can complete many tasks without having contact with others. Also, we can call to report someone or something that will harm us and others. They say it makes people feel lazy and depend on it so much and without they feel like they can't get nothing done. For example, we are able to make emergency calls at any given time for help without having to go no where. This why technology has a positive effect on our lives. Does technology have a negative effect on people lives? People believe that technology these days is a big part of society and that its effecting people lives in a negative way. For example, If your parents or someone you care about are in a different state or country, and you want to check in on them you can just call them without having to go or travel to them. But at the end of the day it all depends on you and how you want to use it you can make it positive or negative to your life. Although, technology has a negative effects on people lives, I believe that its positive effects is greater for few reasons.

First reason, it allows people to do much more in less time. For example, people can check out books, shop, and learn without having to go no where or speaking to another person.       . Not only we can call for emergency we can also call people we care about that we cant reach.

Final reason, We are able to talk to people we care about and love that we can't reach. Not only that it saves us time it also saves lives.

Another reason, it helps us and others on emergency situations",0
"With the right guidance and support, even intimidating tasks can be tackled confidently. As an example, a language teacher of mine once told me that she knew I could master a difficult syntax exercise if I put in enough effort. This pushed me to overcome my fear of failure and encouraged me to stay determined to complete the task.

Overall, when teachers recognize and undercut the effort that their students put into their work, it creates a strong sense of determination and boosts self-confidence. This can provide a significant advantage when it comes to problem-solving and competing against one’s own goals.. 
The power of positive feedback from teachers should not be underestimated. 

For example, when I was younger, I remember feeling so proud when my math teacher praised me for studying hard and for scoring well on my tests. As a student, being acknowledged for our hard work and achievements can inject us with a great sense of determination and self-confidence to strive for even greater heights. This recognition kept me motivated to dive even deeper into the subject matter and tackle every challenging problem I encountered with enthusiasm. 

In addition to this, when a student knows that their teacher expects them to succeed, they will feel more confident in their abilities",1
". when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down. In addition the technology expose our private life. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. Albert Einsteins said "" I am afraid that one day the technology outdo the human brain."" He was afraid that one day the technology controls humanity. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. I am going to expose my family and friends. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. in the actuality the people act like robots. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on people's lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. The technology is opaquing our intellect",0
"Never stop trying something new in life it will turn out be more successful then you never to be expected.

This that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience.  . This show that

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience.

The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. Another example I wasn't good at Algebra at all I was fail the class also Got F on classwork and test to

I decide to stay after with teacher start practical math question I understand little by little but the first take my math test able pass test got B on the test my first every to got B on math. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasn't good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose they are wrongs. Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish.

Finally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasn't good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them.

My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots;

when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned.

Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . She always practical how to read in English and write English. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft.

Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. Having you wonder why people able to accomplish so much just in few days? Today society people always works so much they miss out their opportunity in life. He was successful because he always like to do somethings

Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience.

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful",0
"Above all, it is essential to take one's time and thoroughly consider the decision twice before taking any action. 

It is important to consider the importance of trusting your own decision, rather than always relying on expert advice or the opinion of authorities. Listening to professionals can provide helpful information, but one must always exercise their own judgment and be aware of their own feelings and thoughts. When making decisions, it is important to weigh up both one's own opinion against that of family and other sources, in order to make the best decision. This way, one can ensure that their decision is well informed and considered.. Other people, such as family and friends, can provide a valuable source of input, which can help give clarity to one's own ideas and provide insight into the perspectives of other people. Ignoring your intuition and making the wrong decision can have dire consequences, ranging from missed opportunities to poor physical or mental health",1
"All students should be aware of the value of work experience and should seek to demonstrate their ability to make the most of their time and effort in any job they secure. 
Despite growing concern of student debt, students still have the right to pursue any career they deem fit. Working in college and making the most out of these opportunities has the potential to open more doors to further career advancements, enabling students to become independent. While working in college can offer financial relief, this should not be the only reason. 

Before committing to any job, students should consider the following factors: Are they interested in this job, will it offer them the experience they need, how will the job benefit them in the long run? Education should also be a factor, as certain jobs may require more training and qualifications than others. Lastly, student should take their parents' advice on their career journey into account. In this way, we all have the right to make our own decisions regarding our future, and strive towards success in any way we can.. Parents have attained their wealth of knowledge through life experiences, and their advice can help students to make better informed decisions on their first steps.

Ultimately, the right to continue our education or choose a career should be balanced with the responsibility to ensure that the career path pursued helps us to develop our skills and provides us with meaningful experiences",1
"         . Since the majority of people want the success, but the successful does not come over night. To demonstrate this positive attitude you can achieve your goals no matter what obstacle that life put in front of you.

Secondly, to be successful you need to have a positive attitude. Many people believe that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. you should use your talent and so you can change the direction of your goals. Some persons are always trying to make you negative but you have to keep going and fight for your future. Obviously, having a positive attitude will help you success. Clearly not everyone needs to have a positive attitude to have an accomplishment.

Surely having a positive attitude is beneficial to accomplish effectively what your proposes of life should be.

If you are not successful in something, it is because you are not trying something that is a passions of yours. Even if you always are failing in your life, but if you still have a positive attitude you can achieve your goals and be successful.

First, with a positive attitude the people are going to recognize you as a person that always like to fight with positive attitude an achieve your goals. Something the success does not come as fast you would like. The most important thing to success is to know what you really want in life and grab it with an attitude.

Sometimes it is not important to have a positive attitude to obtain success. In other words you just have to find your talent and prove in a different way that you can be successful. So you have to get out of your comfortable place and take control of your life without fear",0

In order to fully understand whether committing to a career at a young age can be beneficial or detrimental, it is important to look at current trends. 

Many successful people have committed to a career at a young age and found great success. 

In conclusion, while it can be intimidating for students to commit to a career at a young age, there are numerous advantages and disadvantages to consider. Finally, committing to a career early allows students to explore options for higher education such as early college programs, specialized certifications, and apprenticeships. At just 19, he was already a millionaire and a well-known figure in technology. One notable example is Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook. 

With the current focus on college and career readiness, more and more students are finding themselves asking the same question: should they commit to a career at a young age? To many, the idea of committing to a career before graduating high school is intimidating. 

There are many reasons to support the argument that students should commit to a career at a young age. Additionally, a 2018 Pew Research Center survey found that 56% of adults under the age of 30 had already figured out the specific career they wanted to pursue and were actively seeking the knowledge and skills to make it happen. Conversely, some students fear that committing to a career before experiencing a wide variety of college courses or internships may cause them to miss out on the chance to explore new interests. Furthermore, committing to a career early provides students with the chance to have more meaningful and relevant internships and job experiences that would not be possible if they had delayed the process. There is no right or wrong answer as to whether students should commit to a career at a young age, but it can be a rewarding and beneficial process for those who are. One such reason is that students who have a goal in mind may be more motivated to succeed in school and beyond. For one, the unemployed youth rate has been steadily declining over the past few years thanks to increased focus on college and career readiness. Similarly, 22-year-old Sofia Amoruso is the founder of Nasty Gal and at 30-years-old became the youngest female, self-made billionaire. On one hand, committing to a career early can provide students with the opportunity to gain valuable and relevant experience in their chosen field upon graduation. Additionally, many students equate the process of committing to a career early with maturity and a sense of purpose and direction",1

"In agreement with Churchill, I believe failure is an essential part of the process of achieving long-term success.. 
In Winston Churchill’s statement on the importance of failure, he argued that failure is crucial for individuals seeking success. In both of these cases, failure was necessary for success. Similarly, I can think of a friend of mine who failed his first driving test, but worked to understand driver safety laws better, and passed the test the second time. Identifying with this idea, I think of a time in my life when I failed and subsequently achieved success: when I got a low grade on a maths test, I worked harder to properly understand the material and ultimately did well in the following tests",1
"students are mean cause they could use someone's number and tell them awful stuff and would say the same thing what they say. cell phones are okay but students are always texting during class when teachers are teaching. all students are buying cool phones cause they think they are cool cause other kids has cheap ones and telling them their phones are ugly. the cell phones company are starting to make new cell phones and people are starting to buy fancy phones like droid so are the students. i think that students should have cell phones at passing time and lunch time so these students can relax and they don't have to get their phones taken away and they don't have a problem and they need to put their cell phones on vibrate or turned off but students don't want to put their phones in their lockers cause they get stolen which they get mad and they need to buy another one.

students needs their phones so they can contact their family if some thing happens or their family get robbed then how are you going to communicate. so i say lets not have cell phones at school that would be okay to me.. cell phones are very cool to have and its kind of a lot of money to pay for those fancy phones",0
"In conclusion, students need four years in high school for they can take courses where they are interesting and they can start to grow up in that courses.

Secondly, student are not joy in they last year of high school. In conclusion, student need a four year of high school for they can get anything what they have to be done.

In conclusion, put this program in school is a bad idea because make students to finish high school in three years. For example, school where are make student to graduate in three years, in they last year student have to take courses and SOL for they can graduate on time, if they dont past students most retake, and this make students frustrate. But if they fail any classes that make students add more classes to they last year and all this make student to no joy they last year in high school. In conclusion, Last year for students don't have to be the worse year.

In other hand, there are people say, student just need three year in high school, for student can enter college or the work one year early. This program is making students to rush. Because when students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting and student are not joy in they last year of high school. For example, students want to graduate on time, and they need to catch up or retake anything they can do it in the last year. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school.

First, when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course. For example, many students are interesting in elective courses, but they not got enough time to taking elective courses because they are take the basic courses for they can graduate on time. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school. In many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This program make students to take classes that can help them to graduate on time, and many student take courses during the summers or in the evening. Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. This argument is incorrect because in the four year students are doing what they need to finish and they planing where they wants to go if college or work. In conclusion, make high schools just three year to students is not enough time for students to be ready and plan their future.. This is a bad idea making students to finish high school in three years. When students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting. They argument, that student with three year are ready to graduate and enter college or the work, because many student may finish with their courses and SOL in their third year and the last year they don't do nothing",0
"Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. his sibling are loud he can't focus. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. I hope this helps you with your every day situation.. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. Community parks has it all open space, sun ,green grass, tables and a nice setting in general.

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers",0
"However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools.

Overall, Working from home would benifit me because I like to work on the computers, I can take breaks, see my family, and be on my couch.. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper",0
"Working in a group is less work and more ideas.

As I was saying that their are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working. Dear Teacher,

I think that working in group or working alone has some advantages and disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that working in a group their is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done.

To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Therefore working in a group is less work and turning in work fast, As a result you won't have to worry about asking for help or not having ideas because thats is why you are in a group to get your work done and have a lot information.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name                . But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. I choose working in group because their are many advantages. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together some times one person does the whole work and the other doesn't. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work.

My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other",0
"Perhaps you set a goal to pass your permit test. 
Throughout his life, Michelangelo was an advocate for setting ambitious goals and taking risks, regardless of the outcome. Here, contestants put it all on the line in a high-stakes cook-off, showing the importance of setting big goals and having the courage to risk failure to achieve success. 

On a more personal level, many of us can look to our own lives for examples. 

One example can be seen in the popular television show Masterchef. When you find out you have passed the test, you are rewarded with the satisfaction of having taken the risk, worked hard, and accomplished your goal.

In the end, it’s important to take the advice of Michelangelo and others to heart. Taking risks and failing can be intimidating and even frightening, but it is often necessary in order to achieve greater successes. Taking a risk and studying hard, you take the test with the anticipation and fear of failure looming in the back of your mind. He said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” This sentiment resonates today as we look to examples of taking risks and setting big goals. As Michelangelo said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” Taking risks can make us better people, and can help us to reach heights we might not have achieved otherwise.",1
"other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they can't get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching.

I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they can't focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video.

for this way I find it very difficult for student to gained any learning from taking the online or the video conferencing class. I know taking online or watching video conferencing class can be relaxing sometime, and sometimes student even pray for school to be close. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student don't gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching.

secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing can't be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. but that does not mean student should take online classes or watch video conferencing , It not a good idea for student to be take online classes and I am not in favor of the idea for student to take online or watch video conferencing because they can find the online teaching to be boring and it will be very hard for student to understand the teaching of the video.

Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing.

firstly why I don't agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they can't focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like if the video is playing but the student don't understand the teaching of the video he or she can't get the chance to ask question about what they don't understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she don't understand they can ask question about the topic.

"it's a gtood idea for us the students, like that we could know what we want to study when we be graduated from the high school. I would like to study for pilot, so i can try to choose one class to be related about that and learn about how to drive an airplane.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students don't have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. we have a lot of time to think about it. I think that's the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but it's not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school.

Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early.

the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too.

in others words if you don't have a good grades you can't sign for that schools.

You needed be prepare every time, If you do, You can study in the best university and achieve your dreams.",0
"Working in a group has it's advantages, and I feel it's a better choice. When you work in a group, you can meet new people and make friends. Because not only they can share there different ideas. You can get it done half as fast with every one in the group does what they have to do and work as a team .

When you work in a group you can met new people. You can also see people creativity. You learn how to work as a team. You can see the same problem in different ways but as a group you try to find the best way to solve them. Also you can split work and everyone can get a small portion of the project. When work work in a group you can see different ideas,learn to work with other and also you can met new people.

When you work with other people you can see the different ideas also you can learn know things.        . Also you can share you ideas with your group,and see if they like it or maybe they can add something more to your idea to make it a better one . For example let's say you have to do a project for a class, and you have to do it in a group. Maybe you change schools. If it is a really big project you dint have to do it alone. For example you really like to draw but you do not know how to draw really good maybe some one from your group knows how and they can teach you .

As a conclusion I think student do benefit when they are in group. I

strongly believe student do benefit from working in a group. Also it works so you can get out your confer zone and try new things. Even though other believe working alone is easier and better. As a group you can share you Knowledge of what you know about the topic and share them with you group . You can see who you have in common with them also you can see the differences you have with you group members .

Working as a group can really have a good advantages. It also work if you are shy because in a group you have to communicate with others to get the work done, or you are just a born leader you can help other how to start the project together or tell people how to do thing because they do not know what to do first. In a group every one is good in something, so lets say if there is some who is really good at drawing and some one really good in writing then the project can look really nice and the penmanship will look great. You do not know any one at your new school. You can met new people, and make new friends",0
"Know new culture's from different's parts of the world is fun. Also be in a group helps to perform our skills for communicate and language. I believe that working with a group is better because we meet new cultures, we learn how to communicate and we help each other.

We meet new cultures by others student who are in our group. We start to learn know his culture and what they believe. Or sometimes we only want some one who can we talk to. By working alone it makes feel alone. We start work together and getting better by communicating. Interact whit people helps a lot and make work more easier.. We give support, we get support by working in group. We start to learn about they language and how they communicate in their language too. Groups are the best way to perform language speaking.

Some people might say work alone is better because is only my self no one more, but in a group is more easy way to learn with help. Due people has to do all by they self? Sometimes is hard to do all the job with out help. Also the food and the music from their country. Went there is a new person the group can help the new student with school stuff: where the next class is, where the cafeteria is,

where the buses stop, etc. Be in a group also help to make work more easy because we help each other by putting ideas together. We start to share thing's from our culture and what like to do and our free times. We start to talk with new person's. Communicate is something important for live and our society to. Communication is important for every one.

In groups we can help each other in projects or even in late work if we miss a day of class. Meet new persons from others country's is good so that way we start to know more about the world.

We learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to",0
"We are constantly exposed to what others are saying, doing, and believing, creating a proliferation of ideals and beliefs that have the power to shape us.

Though the influence of other people can be beneficial to a certain extent, it is important to note that example is not the only thing in influencing others — respect, dialogue, and mutual understanding are just as important. Family dynamics are incredibly powerful, as the values and practices we observe at home become ingrained in our personal frameworks, influencing our decisions now and in the future.

On a larger scale, the influence of society and its institutions is something that affects us all. Whether it’s through the lessons we learn in the classroom, the expectations of grades, or the aspirations to achieve more, these values are taught to us from a young age, creating an expectation to try and do the best we can.

Furthermore, social media has become another incredibly powerful influence in recent times. It is no mistake that the perception of education in our society is of the utmost importance; we associate success with education, something that is passed down to us in various ways from school. From family to society, school to social media, we are constantly exposed to examples of how others behave, and these examples shape us in unpredictable ways.

Take our family, for instance; as children, we look to our parents to learn how to interact with the world — both what is appropriate and inappropriate. These key elements only come into play when we learn to recognize the importance of listening to one another, and understanding our shared humanity.. It is widely accepted that we are subject to the influence of a variety of people and institutions in our lives. 
Example:

The actions of others have long been said to influence us as individuals. We observe their behaviors and mannerisms, often unconsciously mimicking the way they communicate and interact with others. It has provided us with a platform to interact with other people, providing a vast space for examples to be viewed and replicated",1
". I disagree with what John Lubbock saids ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. For example if someones morals aren't made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work.

I get where Mr. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals.

As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character.

In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. Ones morals has a big role in character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings. Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another",0
"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily.     ",0
"Additionally, try verbalizing the pass you plan on making before you make it. With practice and dedication, these strategies can help you remember to pass the ball during games.. Finally, it’s important to practice passing drills in training and games, as this will help you build muscle memory and help you know when and how to pass the ball. This will help you make the right decision quickly and not miss out on chances to connect with teammates. 
One effective strategy for remembering to pass the ball in soccer is to focus on your teammates, both while playing the ball and when you don’t have it. During games, be aware of potential passing options from the moment the ball is kicked. This will help you develop a sense of mental discipline which, in the heat of the game, will help you decide when the best time to pass the ball is",1

"While it may send the message that the children's actions have significant consequences, it usually results in further disconnection and isolation rather than long-term behavioral changes. 

Other approaches such as conflict resolution training and restorative justice show far greater promise in helping children recognize their mistakes and resolve conflicts without resorting to harmful behaviors. Conflict resolution training teaches children how to recognize, express, and resolve feelings, while restorative justice allows them to reconcile with the people they've hurt and take responsibility for their actions.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to curbing evil behavior in children, there is evidence to suggest that conflict resolution and restorative justice are some of the most effective methods available. 
Recent studies suggest that separating children from their relatives in an effort to diminish their tendency to perform evil acts is an ineffective approach. These strategies create an environment of understanding and communication, encouraging children to work through their problems and build better relationships.",1
"For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. yes they benefit from learning and it helps them out. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home.

finally, last but not least college. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they'll be ready because thats how college is online.

Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.?

In conclution online classses and video conferencing is the best way of learning. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed.

Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. ",0

Success is often achieved through hard work, dedication, focus, and discipline, but failure is also an important part of the journey. Many successful scientists, students, entrepreneurs, and social media influencers have found a path to success through their experiences of failure. Those who combine skill with persistence, failure, and determination are more likely to become successful in the long term. Learning from failure enables us to make smarter decisions and consider different plans of action, leading to greater success.. The same can be said of entrepreneurs who must try, fail, adjust, and try again, learning valuable lessons along the way. Similarly, student athletes learn that while failure can be devastating, it gives them the opportunity to become better players, teammates, and people. Thomas Edison famously said, “I have not failed. Many influencers have achieved success overnight, yet this will usually only last as long as the hype. Social media is another avenue through which success is achieved. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” He was willing to take risks and learn from his mistakes to invent the light bulb",1
"They provided me with valuable advice, helping me gain a better understanding of the potential career choice. To gain even more insight, I visited the library and read through multiple books about the profession and spoke to experienced individuals who have already pursued the same career. I asked them questions regarding their job, wages, and if they could provide any tips or guidance.  All of these efforts provided me with the necessary information to make an informed decision about the career I want to pursue.. 
After extensive research into the career path I'm interested in, including how much people can make and what the job entails, I decided to ask for advice from my parents, older siblings, and counselors",1
"Learning websites can help them get better at what they do. They want to try out some different learning strategies.

2. They can try taking some subjects that they like.

In conclusion, it could be able to work for the home-schoolers to also have an education because they did not go to public but have it at home.. Many other schools have students at home take taking these course and have them apply for it. For example, Home-schooling could that much money. It could benefit because they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject. There could be some reasons for them.

1. For example, taking classes online would give you a head start. It is like a benefit for them to take some opportunity to get taught about something they have learn or to have a different way of learning it.

I will think they would able to do this if they are interested. Some student can take classes at home because they could find a subject of course that like. They can apply online.

"First of all, the technology is really usefull and i think that it will have a posiitive effect in people's lives, the cuestion is how?. You can learn how to be an artist, how to cook, and how to fix something broken.

In addition, sometimes people get addicted in a web and that could be bad, that is when the negative effecs came, people don't know what they are doing when they get adicted to it, that is why people have to know how to use it correctly

Consecuently, the technology is developing more and more, we can built great things for the future and create more, eventually, the tecnology is not the only one that is developing, there is the science too because it help to develop other things and bring protection to people.

In conclution, the technology can bring positive effects to people because is a sounce of knowledge that you can use to inprove people's live.. In the mean time you can use your phone and unload an app to shop somthing that you like, there are several things like clothes, shoes, food, tools, and other things that can be usefull for you or you child, whatever, and there is also the app for books; people don't have to take a lot of time loking for a book, they can just find it by put it in the device or the computter

Third, some benefits of the technology is the time that you spent looking for sonthing or deciding, another benfit is the things that you can learn with all the information that is in the web, ofcourse if you use it properly like it is. For example, people will not have to take a bus to visit other people, or walk miles to see other folks, instead they can just call in their phones and have a little chit chat by using tecnology.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else",0

While many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. I wouldn't want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. By leading me in the right path, and by not doing something I am not sure about and letting that go to waste.               . ""I want to be a singer!"", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. I would be able to develop the skills you guide me in and also by keeping me on track. With the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, I may become one the greatest artist in this generation.

I am hoping you really consider the motivation I have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world.

With that being said, It would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in my career with your help. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in.

The dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldn't be a problem at all. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them.

Once the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work I have put in and also being sure with what career I want in my future, I would gain more passion and inspiration. The road this company would lead me in would help me become successful. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. Your help wouldn't go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. May you please give me the opportunity to suceed? I would love to have your help by keeping me on track to my future. This would help me to push until I have accomplished everything I have worked for. I couldn't of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success.

In fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge",0
"We should commit to a career at a older age, not at a younger age.. Students in high school need to understand that if they don't like the career that they choose, they are more likely to fail than succeeding than others in their careers. Few of my friends want to become a doctor, and some of my other friends would want to become a mechanic. Thinking about a career isn't easy, yet some students don't take it seriously of what career that they are committed to. Support is a main key to success; however, few of my friends disagree with me. The reason why I choose this topic, for people need time, impression, and support for their careers.

People always need time to think of what career that they would want to choose, so they can enjoy their careers, and have better reputation in their work. Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Personally, I would rather go to my house, and eat spaghetti because people need to realize of what career they would want to choose if they would want to succeed in the future. People also need to support young kids that having a career is a longtime changing, so they would have to think about it in college, and not in high school. Even people do want to commit to a career at a young age they would still need to know what to do to learn in college. These are the reasons why I think young people should have more time to think of what career that they would want to have, so they can gain more confidence in the future.

Impression is also important, for it helps people gain morale if they would want to think of a career. Careers are like longtime thinking, for people would want to change their minds, and choose another career that is more suitable for them to learn in college. Generic_Name wanted to become a doctor, yet she didn't do well, so she gotten support to look for another career in college. The reason why they don't believe in support, for they found careers easier without receiving help in college, or even in high school. Impression would help some students in high school, but some teachers do think it would also help them in college. I do agree that some students should brainstorm about their careers in high school; however, I am not very sure if they would like to learn a lot about whatever career they have committed to. Some students think having impression won't help you, yet some students do agree that having impression would help pressure them to find a career. The reason why I like support, for I wouldn't want to brainstorm careers by myself.

The thing about young people is that thinking about careers in high school should have more time to think, for it is always important of what career they would want to choose. Generic_Name went to college with impression, so she had the confidence of choosing what career that she would like to choose at a older age. These are all the reasons why I think we should have time, impression, and support. Impression isn't for everybody, nor it is for some students who need of help finding a career in high school or college. Personally, I would need impression if I would wanna go to college.

Support is also good too, for people who aren't confident of choosing what career they want to learn about, so they would ask their friends, or even family members for help and support. Some teachers think it is a better idea to think of a career in high school, yet some students disagree with the teachers. Bunch of students agree that having to think about career in high school is a good thing; however, a lot of students disagree that we should have more time to think about careers at a older age",0
"so i say lets not have cell phones at school that would be okay to me.. students are mean cause they could use someone's number and tell them awful stuff and would say the same thing what they say. i think that students should have cell phones at passing time and lunch time so these students can relax and they don't have to get their phones taken away and they don't have a problem and they need to put their cell phones on vibrate or turned off but students don't want to put their phones in their lockers cause they get stolen which they get mad and they need to buy another one.

students needs their phones so they can contact their family if some thing happens or their family get robbed then how are you going to communicate. cell phones are very cool to have and its kind of a lot of money to pay for those fancy phones. all students are buying cool phones cause they think they are cool cause other kids has cheap ones and telling them their phones are ugly. the cell phones company are starting to make new cell phones and people are starting to buy fancy phones like droid so are the students. cell phones are okay but students are always texting during class when teachers are teaching",0
"Today I would like to talk about students averages and participations.

students are complain because they want to participate in sports, and other activities and they think it is not right that they have to have a grade of B average to enter a sport class so dear principal i would like you to keep the rule of havening a c average to enter sport or other class available, and i would thank you if you would not change it for the students that are doing good in there class's and there work.

student comment

I think you should not change the schools policy because it would not be fair.

I think if students don't have at least one fun class they should not come to school and school would be the boring thing ever and if you have to work all day you would be tired and your brain would stop working as good so that is what i think about the schools policy.      ",0
"Although, some students prefer not to be committed to a specific career in their high school years. Students will enjoy more of their time rather than other students who are committed to one thing. Some students just like to take their time and explore new things and that way it can give them ideas about what to do in the future. Students can do whatever they want to at a young age. Some students wont be able to prepare for whats coming. . Unless if students really love to what they are committed to, they wont enjoy much of their time. Exploring new things at the young age is very fun.

With students being committed at a young age and all, exploring new things at a young age is very fun. Students committing to a career at a young age can actually be very helpful. They can stick to it and have it as their career. Students will not be able to enjoy what other students enjoy. Other students just decide what to do when they are in college. For example, if one student is committed to one thing but does not love what he is doing and the other student who is exploring new things and enjoying his time, then the student exploring will enjoy more of his time and be happy as well.

Being committed at a young age, exploring new things are fun but Lastly, students decide what to do as they enter college. Students entering college and immediately deciding what to do without actually knowing anything about what they chose is not so fun. For example, if students had chose what to do while they were in high school then they would have time to prepare for what they would be doing in college. That being said, committed at young age, exploring new things, deciding in college.

Students being committed at a young age is helpful and will benefit themselves for the future. But choosing what to do as you head in to college can be tough for some students.

In conclusion, being committed at a young age is good and beneficial for students but it can get boring and sad, unless if students truly love what they are doing. Students do not have to worry or stress about being committed to just one thing. This way they know what they will enjoy and what they wont enjoy. Now students who explore new things at a young age is what most students should do. Especially if they are focusing and putting hard work at a young age. Students sticking to one area for their career at a young age and just being focused on it is what they need in order to get there. Students exploring at a young age will have more opportunities to see what they like. Students deciding as they head to college is pretty tough. Once students find what they love. However, some students may not enjoy having to just stick with one area",0
". Being yourself doesn't depends in how people see you, it depends on you because you are the only one that can choose to change or not, it makes no difference if you did something right or wrong the society always will discriminate and see that at the way they think it is,and you can't do anything about it, you are doing the things that you feel that are correct and how is the way how is has to be, however being in a world that is trying to make you something else is a great accomplishment because there is not way people make you change;

you had to live your life at the way you want it, you have the opportunity to express your feelings everywhere, and you are in the world to be happy and not to satisfy every single person

Sometimes it's hard for you to be deal in the society with opinions that hurt you and make you feel bad about it, and that is something that you cannot change, but it is something that help you to learn how to be more responsible when you are growing up and to be overconfident about what are your thoughts, you have to know that in the world are many people want to see you go down and change the way you are, in that situation you have to be with your head up and be who you really want to be, you can do the difference in your life, but not in others person life

In addition, you have to be proud and brave everywhere you go to because you have the opportunity to express what are yours feelings, there is not way that somebody can change what is in you heart, only you choose who can hurt you and if you want that continue, try to stay positive all the time not matter what is going on in your life, do not let someone know what are your debilities and how you feel about things go in on in your life that person can hurt you every time he/she want it, do the things that make you feel better with yourself

Finally, be happy all the time with the things that you have because it might be the little things, but are things for which you work really hard to have it, you have to be brave especially when you have done something that probably other person will see that bad, however that doesn't mean you are wrong is just what they think about it, you need to be how you feel comfortable and not to maintain happy the society, reach your goals how you want it, don't let anyone destroy your dreams because if that happen you are not going to be cheerful about it

In conclusion, live your life how you want it because is only one, do what you think is correct and follow your dreams, since the moment you let the time past by doing what other people want; you will not be happy nor proud about what you really want to achieve, it's difficult to trust people that one day made you feel safe and in peace and then did things that they knew that it hurt you; if you really want something good for somebody else you will do everything to protect that person and make it feel unique, simply be yourself without get involved in other person's life",0
You can also help people if they need help on something cause you already been threw all of this like how to get a job or how to make your own job and to encourage somebody else to just put there mind to it so that person that you helped they can also helped somebody then it goes own forever and forever and you can tell them how you succeed in they can follow in your foot step and they can tell another person who they succeed and they can tell there story imagination isnt reality it is when you are sleeping or thinking but knowledge you will need it if you are in a situation.. I disagree with this statement because you are supposed to have knowledge imagination is like dreaming but when you have knowledge you can put your mind to something to create something big in the future like having your own company and you can signed workers and to make them delivered stuff to people and all of this is reality even though you need to finish school and go to college and get a degree there it take time you have to get your mind set and encourage your self to do better,0
"It is important for individuals to be aware of why these traits are important and how they can help or hinder their progress in life. Furthermore, it is important to recognize the differences between adults and children in how they approach and execute this same task of developing these traits. Taking the time to select and develop the right character traits can be extremely beneficial in helping people to reach their goals and overall achieve success.. 
One of the most important aspects of personal development is the development of character traits. Improving our own character traits also requires a certain level of discipline and commitment to the process. A person's character traits are the combination of characteristics and qualities that define an individual, both good and bad. Character traits are shaped by a variety of factors, including environment, upbringing, and personal experiences. 

Finally, it is important to take into account the consequences associated with developing certain character traits and the impact this can have on one's life. 

When discussing the development of character traits it is important to consider some examples of people who have achieved extraordinary results and how their character traits have helped them along the way",1

"I practiced showing off clothing and other materials that models often wear and how to best showcase them while conveying the right attitude. 
I spent my week visiting different modeling companies to learn more about the industry. It was an invaluable experience that gave me an in-depth understanding of how the fashion modeling world works.. At each one, I spoke to the professionals and took a tour to understand the behind-the-scenes process of what it takes to become a model. I even took part in some of the lessons, such as learning how to properly walk the runway and how to pose for pictures",1
"Everyday resources and services are welcome additions that often make it easier for citizens and immigrants to manage daily needs and activities. The experiences of being an immigrant can be both challenging and rewarding; I have encountered both opportunities and obstacles, but ultimately am grateful for the growth and progress. 

The culture and society in Generic_City differ from those of United States in several ways; language barriers, economic developments, and school systems are all examples of distinguishing characteristics. 

As an immigrant, I am able to relate to the difficult journey of leaving one’s home in pursuit of a better life. The city boasts a strong job market, competitive educational institutions, and a supportive government leadership. 
Generic_City is a rapidly changing destination that offers a variety of socioeconomic opportunities for immigrants from all walks of life. Overall, my experience living in Generic_City has been a positive one.. Despite these unique differences, visitors can often find similar recreational activities that bring together old and new cultures alike",1
"That is a major cause that is first seen. The way you are approached.

My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off,and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. This statement can be argued from two sides. Some first impressions can be changed and some can't be.

First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change or it can be changed. Your first thoughts of someone. There are so many things a person can have first thoughts about a human being and just assume things about before even getting to meet . It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. But than theirs many other people whos first impressions are changed.

In conclusion, I believe that first impressions can be changed by my perspective, It is hard for someone to change the way they think of someone, but thats why its called ''first thoughts'' because it can be changed over time the way you look at someone can start to be seen differently and your thoughts will change. The way someone's appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed.

One major first thoughts of a person can be the way a other person dresses, the way they look they way the walk, the way they talk. There is a lot of people in this world whos first impressions are impossible for them to change and would never change.    . Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone but it is not impossible to change",0
"If that is a humans who is a persistent person he would be trying more time. People who do this are people that always want the easy thing. For example, if a person aim too high but fail that person would not feel good about him. Also, on these latest years humans has been lazy than doesnt want to effort to do big things and achieve it. Every human need to aim high and be scared of failing that something normal, but never give up always keep going. In addition,

the key to have a awesome overcome is to never give up and never stop.

My second reason is that some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. However, these people do not know the significant of have something that took a lot of efforts. Also, that kind of people who are persistent that always keep trying that people one day they achieve all their goals. This should be because people does not feel ready. Although, some people think that aim too high is a waste of time, nevertheless, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals because some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals.

My first reason is that some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail. Now humans really needs to efforts for something. Some people would want to aim high, but they do not want to know how would be the outcome. Thats not the point, the thing is that every human have to effort to know the significant of never give up. Some times people who fail get depressed. In addition, some people may say that if they aim low they can achieve more things in the time a person that aim too high. Some people say that aim too high is not for them.     . Also, when humans has owned something by their own effort the valuate more what they had achieve.

In summary, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals. Some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. Until that person achieve their big goal. These people does not want to effort that much and achieve their goals",0

Should people make their own decisions, or shoud they seek guidance from experts and authorties.

If you take decisions, you can have a good life for you'r future.    . Take decisions for you is good because you can have good life for the future,if you want go to the college but you talk with you'r self and no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to decisisons go to the college or not go. For Exmaple if you want go to the College but you talk with your self and said no go to the college because you not are Intelligent, so you try to deisions go to the college or not go.

you can take your own decisions,For Example: if you take one decisions are bad or no the people need to repect you'r decisions because is you'r decisions,So They not want to know why you take that decisions in my opinion the people only want the bad for you.

You can take more control about you'r decisions,For Example: you can have more control about you'r decisionsFor Example:you can have more control about you'r decisions if you control you'r decisions you can take good decisions and that is good for take decisions

So, you need to have contro about decisions.

you can have you'r own decisions is good to take you'r decisions because you have more capacity to take other decisions, So in my opinion is good to have a decisions because can help to you in the Future but if you take something good for you'r life or for decisions.

In Conclucion: Should people make their own decisisons, or should they seek from experts and Authories",0
"When we are given opportunities to make our own decisions and pursue what we find interesting or fulfilling, we open up many new doors that the world can't offer. The world will always tell you what to do and who to be, and though it might seem easier to succumb to those pressures, it is important to remember that it is not the right way to achieve success. It can be easy to begin following what the world wants us to be, but this is in direct opposition to finding out who we are and who we want to be. 
Making your own decisions and doing things that you enjoy in life are the keys to creating the greatest successes. This is why it is so important to take the time to pursue our own individual paths and discover what truly brings us joy.. We can accomplish so much more when our decisions and pursuits are in line with who we are as people, instead of trying to fit a mold that someone else has created. 

Taking the time to make our own decisions can also help to solidify our sense of identity. This allows us to develop our skills and gain unique experiences that can ultimately lead to a much greater success than simply following what someone else says. 

Making our own decisions and doing things that we enjoy in life can lead to greater successes than simply following what the world wants us to be. We can only truly be successful when we are being true to ourselves and embracing our individual strengths",1
"For example, my older brother never trust in himself, he always says what about if I do this and it no gonna work, he was negative, he always had negative thoughts, he never tries make something else to get on top of his goals or what he wants. For example, my best friend Generic_Name always says don't worry about the time you have to get what you want, you have to accomplish the things that you porpuse yourself take the advantage of the time.

To sum up, as you can see if you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different things. Just try keep in youjr mind that the ones who work in what they want they to achieve. You most have to trust in yourself. Manyh people may think why people should try twice, but that's not the point. The just think that they want to accomplish their dreams. In my opinion, I believe that people have to try to make something else to accomplish their goals because people don't trust themself, people don't take second chance, doesn't matter the time.

To begin with, most of people do not trust themself. There are people that think that can not do it, but they are wrong because if you propose something to yourself you have to work on it, you have to be a positive person if you want to persevere. My grandmother always says ''If you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different ways to get in the top of your objective.'' Back in my country Bolivia the mayority of old people said that you have to be resourceful if you want to get what you want. My grandma told him that he has to try even though things are hard, if he want to accomplish his goals he had to try to make something else to achieve his goals.

Secondly, there are people that don't take second chance to get on top of their goals. I think people don't believe in themself, don't try twice, and people don't think about the time.. For instance, in my situation, I used to ignore the secod chance because I thought that if I did one time and it wasn't that great so is gonna be the same the second time, but I was wrong. The point is that you have to keep going and try your best to get your goals. Hence, it wasn't like that,so what I trying to say is that is essential to try, try, and try, ''My mom always says don't be scared to do it, the thing that are worth it isn't eassy you have to try and give your best.''

In addition, many people said you must have to try something else it doesn't matter the time. But one day my grandma talked to him. I am agree with this statement. There are people that does't care how many time they try something, to get in their goals. The 60% of people when they have something done, they don't like the result so they don't want to do it again because they did ones so they don't want to do it twice, they think that they gonna get the same result",0
"For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 don't do anything. For example some students don't like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so it's best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. Sometimes in life we want everything but sometimes we have to earn them all by ourselves not with someones help but our own help.. In my opinion I think it's best for students to work alone then to be working in group. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they don't have to fail the class. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. If I was to explain to my teacher if I prefer to work in groups or work alone, I would pick work alone. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they don't need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work.

Students often don't really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students can't think about. Students sometimes don't even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. In some cases some students don't let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do",0
"Always look up never down. That's not going to help you in life. Things got harder for me. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. I started to believe. thats how life is. I would share that life is not easy. what's the point of being mean. Because when you grow up you won't be able to go back

In the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Don't take your anger out on others. We need to believe, have hope in life. Taking your anger out on someone who didn't do anything is not going to help. Cause if you do look down you won't see your bright future that will come.

Do good things in your life. You don't know what can happen if you rush things in life. Give things time, be patient. Just don't think negative. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick. Everything will get better. But that didn't help. Life teaches us a lesson. Nothing but to hope that they will get better. I didn't have hope. life is full of lessons that will teach us something. Enjoy it bore it ends.

Everyone goes through something in their life. It helped me a lot. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Enjoy your life as much as you can. But then i realized why am i thinking negative? and not trying. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. if we dont how can we know things will get better.

We need to have hope to learn the lesson.

The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind.

For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. life is never easy. enjoy your childhood. Like be nice to people don't be rude, disrespectful, and mean. How is this going to help me in life. I opened my eyes and began to try. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson.

Don't rush things in your life. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. . Its's making the problem worse",0
"I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldn't be doing and that won't help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they aren't learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and won't be really for quiz or test. But they are wrong students don't need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they don't need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldn't be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school.. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they won't be doing their work they will be doing other things that aren't importante. Students shouldn't use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. For example when a test is coming up they don't do well on because they haven't been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they can't do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Thereforce that is why students shouldn't be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they won't need their cell phones to find their research",0
"What are the benefits of working with a group and working alone? I believe that working in groups helps you to have more ideas, more knowledge, because if you communicate with your group members, they'll think about different ideas to proceed the work that is getting done. Working alone sometimes helps you more than working with groups because you are responsible for your own work.

I rather work by myself because I've had bad experience working with groups. If you work with someone who doesn't care and is always playing around, you won't get anything done and will receive a bad grade unless you do all the work and the other person will just get credit by not doing anything, in that case there is no point to work in groups.

In conclusion, I believe it's more beneficial to work alone than groups because you can focus more on what you're doing and take responsibility of your own work, because if you don't take care of your school work nobody is going to do it for you.                  . When I work in groups sometimes I'm the one that has to do all the work, and in my opinion if we are working in groups we have to help each other, communicate and share our thoughts because if we don't do that what's the point of working in groups. For example, I'm a very shy person, it's rare the times I talk in class but when I'm in a group I have to talk, share my thoughts with my group members and communicate with them.

Reasons why I prefer working alone are: I focus more doing my own work, it's only my responsibility not others, I have to worry to turn it in on time, if i get a bad grade it's going to be my fault not others, I'm responsible for my own actions, I have to make sure if everything is right to get all the credit.

Reasons why I don't like to work in groups are: sometimes they're not responsible for doing their part, if they do their work they do it all messy( you can't even understand their hand writing), they play around too much because sometimes they take it as free time, they spend most of the time on their phone instead of doing what they are supposed to do, sometimes they don't do their part in time and we have to turn it in late and don't get all the credit.

I believe working in groups is beneficial but at the same time it's not, I think it depends with the people you work with, because if you work with people that do their work and actually care about school they will definitely be beneficial and make your group work out. However, I think working in groups is important because you can come out of your comfort zone and be free to share your thoughts with your group members, and you can make friends too. So you have to chose what's better for you and what's going to benefit you more, but for me I feel like working alone is more beneficial for me than working in groups",0
"In conclusion thats why high school students should take early graduation program. Why high school school students should not take school programs that allow to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years .Students who take this program most take class after school , summer time or they not allow to take elective courses .Consequently students who take this program have less time to do homework, spend time with family or friends, enjoy the summer time or they not allow to take important elective classes like, foreign language, nutrition, music classes, computer skill class, or HPE.

Also students who take this program they could take classes for the same subject like, English nine and English teen at the same year. . But students who take this program are more exposed to fail or give up for the rush time that is in the programs and regular school years don`t have that problem. However students who take this program and they are going to college they could finish more early college and students who not going to college they can start working more early",0
"
Graduating from high school in three years can be an attractive option for certain students looking to jumpstart their education or careers. However, completing high school in such a short period of time also has its drawbacks. 

For example, a student who wishes to graduate early may need to double up on certain classes or even sacrifice certain electives. This could limit their exposure to different fields of study and potentially reduce their future college options. Furthermore, the intense workload demanded by an accelerated graduation schedule can lead to greater levels of stress which can take its toll on a student both mentally and physically.

Overall, graduating from high school in three years can be beneficial in a variety of ways, but it's important to weigh all the necessary requirements and possible drawbacks. There are various challenges to consider such as having to forego certain extracurricular activities and making sure the necessary academic criteria is met. It may allow them to enter the workforce earlier, potentially providing more job prospects or enhancing the ability to get into top colleges. It can be a great option for some students, but it's important to consider the long-term effects that it could have on their studies and future career.",1
"
Extracurricular activities can have a positive effect on students, helping to reduce stress, increase grades, and strengthen family relationships. Participating in extracurricular activities can also give students the opportunity to build strong, supportive relationships, which can help them to cope with stress and related issues. They also tend to have higher grades, which can lead to improved family relationships, as parents often take an interest in their child's academic progress. Additionally, extracurricular activities provide a sense of purpose and belonging, which can help a student's overall mental wellbeing. Studies show that students who participate in extracurricular activities have lower levels of stress than those who don't. Ultimately, extracurricular activities can be an effective way to reduce stress, boost grades, and strengthen family ties.",1
"Another potential disadvantage is that the 3-year program limits students’ opportunities to explore multiple subject areas and discover their interests. On the other hand, students may find themselves unprepared for the speed at which they complete their education and may have difficulty keeping up with the intensity of the program. 
Providing students with the option to complete high school in three years instead of four has both potential benefits and drawbacks. Many students may miss out on learning experiences that would shape their further education or life paths if they were to stay in school for the full four years.. This means that any student who enters the program with the necessary qualifications and dedication would have the potential to graduate from college faster than their peers. The primary motivation for this type of program is to give students an academic head start on college or vocational school",1
"However, it is also important to understand the information and advice that is being provided before attempting to create a solution. In both Empires, it was viewed as essential to truly understand the opinion and contributions of all parties involved in order to create a favorable outcome.. By gathering input from multiple people, there is greater potential for a better solution to be identified and for the efficiency of the project to be improved. Collaboration typically involved two or more individuals or groups working together to obtain a desired outcome from a project. Similarly, in the Islamic Empire, collaboration was seen as an important part of the decision-making process and ideas were welcomed from different stakeholders for input.

Combining different ideas and perspectives when seeking advice or trying to solve a problem is a key advantage of collaboration. The multi-faceted approach, which included individuals with different expertise, allowed for all angles to be identified and addressed to ensure the end result was a project that was feasible and beneficial to the Empire. 
In both the Roman and Islamic Empires, collaboration was highly valued as a way of pooling resources and perspectives to achieve common goals. 

For example, when creating a new infrastructure project within the Roman Empire, it was not uncommon for a variety of experts to be consulted. The collaborative approach allowed for different perspectives and ideas to be combined to create more effective solutions",1
"Find ways to be creative and express yourself authentically. Reach out for support from friends and family and practice mindfulness and positive self-talk. 
It is easy to get caught up in the expectations of others. It is important to remember that one should always remain true to themselves and have faith in their abilities and dreams; the only way to succeed is to forge your own path. Following beliefs and opinions that conflict with our own can create feelings of guilt, anger, and resentment. 

Remaining resilient during difficult times is a key component to maintaining one’s individual identity. Discrimination can breed feelings of inferiority that can be difficult to bear. It is helpful to think about the positive aspects of any situation, no matter how dire it may seem. As long as you stay true to yourself, empowering change can be made.",1
"Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.

Lastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.

Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.

I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.

In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.

First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. . Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. 75% of the time students graduate early to go to college",0
"Ultimately, Jefferson's quote holds true - labor is essential and being idle will prove to be ineffective in practical scenarios.. For example, in the workplace, employees who are idle will not produce desirable results, so it is important that they stay engaged in their work. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the Superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."" Through this quote, Jefferson emphasizes the importance of hard work and communicates the idea that being idle is not a desirable quality. This idea can be applied to various practical scenarios. In addition, in a student's academic journey, being idle will prevent them from achieving their educational goals, so it is important to stay focused and motivated. 
In his famous quote, Thomas Jefferson says that ""Labor is Prior to and Independent of Capital",1
"Freshmen students should be starting thier first year of thier high school career around the age of fourteen or fifteen years old, So they can graduate while turning the legal age of eighteen years old in the United States, Which is the correct age of finishing thier high school education. You must study the classes and cources that the program gives you, so you can finish all of your credits and graduate while your family are on vications having a good time.

Finally, In conclusion, this program will mess up your summer plans and would not benefit you with any new progress. Many people think that it is a great idea for high school students to only attend three years of high school education, by taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, It will allows you to graduate a year earlier than your orginal class year, I prefer to attend all four years of high school education, which means that i would attend all four traditional years of high school education, such as: Freshmen year, Sophmore year, Junior year, and Senior year, which is the last year of a student high school education. I suggest the traditonal four years of high school education.. Sophmore students should be starting thier Sophmore year while turning the age of sixteen years old. There are few students that start thier Sophmore year at the age of fifteen years old, Which means that they attended thier first grade in Elementry school younger than others.

Secondly, Graduation issues, Graduation should be the most significant accomplishment in anyone's high school education, When following this program, You are not going to be able to graduate with the same class year as you for example; I graduate with my orginal class of year twenty-twenty. If following this program, you are going to be ahead of your friends and class year.

Thirdly, Shortage of summer, students only get two months as a summer break in the United States, before attending thier next school year. The reasons for my disagreement are: Age problems, Graduation issues, Lack of Experience, and Shortage of a summer break.

Firstly, lets talk about age problems that people who follows this plan are going to go throught. By following this program, you are not going to be able to go on vications and rest from the year that you attended",0

"It all depends on the situation and the individual. Although I valued my own self-reliance, hearing experienced perspectives gave me valuable insight into what I should take into account when making this decision. I weighed the expert advice I received against my own opinion and decided which one was best for me. 
When it comes to making important decisions, neither of the options - asking for guidance from experts or relying solely on your own instincts and ideas - are necessarily better than the other. For instance, when I was trying to make a decision about what college to attend, I found myself relying heavily on the opinions of experts and other people who had been in a similar situation before. This allowed me to make a more informed and confident decision.

At the same time, it's important to note that I still trusted my own instincts and ideas. Asking for help can help you make the best decision based on other people’s experience and knowledge, and still allow you to rely on your instincts to make the final decision.. It's always okay to ask for help even if you value self-reliance - it's a sign of strength",1
"But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.

My initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.

they are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. I believe that keeping our school's lunch menu is a good idea. Dear principal,

I have heard of the school cafeteria's plan to change to a new healthier school lunch. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?

For instance, our school cafeteria's lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the school's improvement is your priority.

Thank you respectively,

Generic_Name 11th grade( junior)                                                                                                                   . So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.

Again,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. American's have this quote that "" if you have lemons make lemonades"" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.

In additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive",0

"We may fall into a negative state of mind, become apathetic, and lose touch with reality. 
Life is unpredictable and full of uncertainties, and no one likes to fail or face hardships. 

In conclusion, it is essential to keep believing in oneself and to never lose hope in life. Too much negativity can make it hard to build relationships, and it can start to hinder us from achieving our goals and making progress. 

Without hope, we can become disillusioned and neglect the things that matter. For example, if we learn to value the little things in life, then we will be more content and grateful for what we have, not always chasing after material goods or things that don't necessarily bring us happiness. Similarly, if we put in the effort to work towards our goals, it can help to cultivate optimism and resilience. However, it is important to keep believing in yourself and to have hope no matter what. Having hope in life means that we can look to the future despite any challenges we may face. We can learn valuable lessons from life that can be applicable to our own lives, and by having hope, we give ourselves the opportunity to have a more rewarding and fulfilling life.. Doing so can help us stay positive and find meaning even in the most difficult of times. We view life as meaningless or hopeless. It means having faith that things will get better, and that we can learn from our mistakes.

The lessons we learn from life can often be applied to our own lives",1

In conclusion, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things. So, you need to always doing something if you want to accomplish.

Second, you can keep learning new things in life, in the school if you still are in there and even in your job. . For example, if you want to buy the car of your dreams, you want a big house is gonna cost too much money but if you have a good job and you doing well in what you do, you can have a car if you want or a house however if you do not want to accomplish you never gonna have something. In my opinion do we accomplish is if we are doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things.

First, if you are always doing something you can have what you want you",0

Excerpt:

Students who work hard and strive to make the best decisions possible should be rewarded for their efforts. This will also encourage students to take their studies more seriously and become more involved in school. Furthermore, it will teach them the value of hard work and dedication, and that it can help them reach their goals.. This will help to develop their social and leadership skills, as well as their academic knowledge. Supporting students who strive to achieve and accomplish goals by allowing them to play sports or participate in activities if they have a B average or higher is a great way to motivate them. By doing so, they will begin to realize the importance of trying hard and making good decisions",1
"Don't be afraid to ask questions! Talking to students who have already made decisions on college courses or career paths can be a great way to learn from their experiences. With the right resources and a clear plan, you will be well prepared to pursue your college course or career path..

Creating a timeline is also a helpful way to plan out your next steps and identify potential career options that are best for you. 
When it comes to deciding on a college course or career path, the process can seem daunting. It is also important to investigate the resources available to students to help them during this process",1

Overall, both working alone and working with a group have their own pros and cons. On the other hand, working with a group can bring fresh ideas and perspectives, creating a more collaborative, innovative environment. But, there is a potential for conflict and confusion with increased input from others. But if collaboration and brainstorming is needed, then working with a group is likely the better option.. Ultimately, the best option should depend on the particular task and what resources are available. 
When it comes to accomplishing a task, there are certain advantages and disadvantages to working alone and working with a group. However, working alone can also lead to anxiety and the feeling of being overwhelmed. Working alone often offers more control over the project and less distraction, putting the individual in a more focused and creative environment. If individual creativity and autonomy is important, then working alone might be the most effective route",1
"Additionally, staying active can help maintain a healthy weight, and can even help one to look and feel better. 
Being active and having an active lifestyle can have many benefits and drawbacks. Staying active can also help one's mental health, as studies have shown that regular physical activity can help reduce levels of stress and depression. Exercising and participating in physical activities can place physical strain and stress on the body, which can lead to aches, pains, and injuries if one is not careful. 

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to living an active lifestyle. Engaging in regular physical activity and staying active can help one achieve overall physical and mental wellbeing, and can also help reduce the risks of many serious diseases.. One benefit of staying active is that it can help improve one's overall physical health, as it can aid in decreasing a variety of disease risks such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, staying active requires motivation and dedication, which can be tough for some people to find.

In conclusion, while there are both benefits and drawbacks to living an active lifestyle, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Additionally, not all forms of exercise are equal, and certain activities can involve more risk than others",1

"Furthermore, group work can foster strong teamwork skills, communication, and problem solving skills - all of which are necessary out in the real world. Additionally, group work has the potential to be more efficient than individual work, as dividing the workload amongst members can speed up the process. Having a common goal and communicating it through all group members ensures that everyone is on the same page, reducing conflict and misinterpretation. This makes it easier to come up with creative solutions to problems. Group work has enabled me to learn from the collective knowledge of my peers, and allowed me to develop my capacity for collaboration and communication. 

Communication is an important factor in group work. 

From my own experience, working in groups can be incredibly advantageous. Collaborative efforts have the advantage of combining a variety of perspectives; when it comes to tackling an issue, two or more people working together can provide different perspectives than a single individual. 
Working in groups has a range of benefits compared to working alone. 

Ultimately, working in groups has many advantages compared to working alone. Furthermore, I was able to use group based activities to develop proficiency in problem solving and negotiation, essential skills in the real world. It is also essential to respect each other's opinions and points of view in order to create an effective atmosphere towards achieving the goal.  For these reasons, group work should be considered as a preferable method of working.. Additionally, groups can provide helpful and constructive feedback to its members, which can help refine ideas and identify potential weaknesses. It is an efficient way of working and allows people to benefit from different perspectives",1
"     . I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday",0

This story can be applied to two contrasting students taking summer vacation. Taking consistent and steady action will give them the resilience required to navigate potential challenges, pitfalls, and moments of doubt. In the story, the tortoise was determined to win the race and took consistent and steady action toward that goal, and the rabbit was distracted and ultimately stopped moving, thus allowing the tortoise to win. 
The story of the tortoise and the rabbit is a timeless lesson of the power of hard work, determination, and taking action. The first student starts work on a task from the beginning of the vacation, while the other student relaxes and does not take action until the end. The student who takes action will have greater success in completing the task than the student who does not take action. 

Ultimately, the lesson of the tortoise and the rabbit gives us insight into the importance of time and how we can make it effective by doing something. We can all benefit from this story by reminding ourselves to take action and stay determined in order to succeed in anything we set out to do.. Taking consistent action prevents failure and allows us to make progress towards our goals. The tale gives us a powerful perspective on the importance of taking steady action to achieve our goals",1
"On the other hand, too much inactivity can lead to decreases in productivity and motivation and can make it more challenging to complete tasks in a given amount of time. 

The importance of effective time management when trying to accomplish a goal cannot be overstated. 
Taking some free time to relax and break away from a work or school task can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on achieving individual goals. Studies have indicated that, when managed carefully, taking breaks throughout the day can significantly improve productivity for those working in busy environments. Having a daily to-do list and breaking tasks up into smaller, more manageable pieces can also help increase overall productivity and allow for more free time during the day. Planning out a schedule and setting aside designated periods of time to complete tasks can help keep idle time to a minimum and ensure that progress is being made. By implementing effective time management strategies, individuals can maximize their potential and reach their fullest potential.. Furthermore, workers who take regular breaks tend to remain more engaged in their tasks while having an improved ability to recall and recall information",1
"Both methods can benefit productivity and high-quality results if they are approached and executed effectively.. Working in a group can provide a great opportunity for collaboration, as multiple individuals come together to brainstorm ideas, openly discuss different options, and share their unique perspectives. Furthermore, it gives the individual the flexibility and autonomy to prioritize tasks and manage their own pacing. 
When it comes to working in a group versus working alone, there are both advantages and disadvantages to consider. 

On the other hand, working alone also has its perks. This is important for those moments when deep and vigorous contemplation is needed to solve complex or unique problems. 

Ultimately, whether you decide to work in a group or alone depends on the task at hand and the individual's preferences. It allows for uninterrupted concentration, uninterrupted focus, and no distractions from direct collaboration with other people. This makes it possible to generate more creative and innovative solutions to tackle challenging projects. Additionally, working in a group can reduce stress for the members as it ensures everyone has accountability and support from one another along the way",1
"Because reason #1 is that we are in school for 8 hours doing work and other thing and we get tired and it's just to much forus kid's or grown ups.

Reason #2 is you don't have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins.

For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you can't go outside cause it's to dark and your parents won't let you cause of hours of school. I disagree for adding one and a half of hour in school days. . That's reason #4.

I get it if yall school's set extra time in school just to make us smart,or have a good life,and a good job,but us kid's and adult's need time for are own self so this is all my reason and example's that I disagree for having extra time in school. That's reason #3.

Reason #4 is a appointment you always come out school at 2:45 and your appointment is at 3:00 but you can't go cause you got extra hours in school i know you can leave early but waste you child or grown up learning time in school. For example you come out of school at 4:00 your tired but you got homework and then you finish your home for like 2 or 3 hoursof extra work but you can't do anything really fun like go out somewhere with freinds cause it's to late and dark. That's reason #2.

Reason #3 is homework you always get home almost every single day doing some extra work and is can take hours to finish",0
"But we shouldn't get lost in it and forget that there are other things waiting to be discovered beyond a tiny screen. They were shown to be a good for both your body and your mind.

Families also become closer when they spend time together with no sort of technolgy that can distract them. People these days don't know what the world outside holds. We live in a world were everything revolves around technology. Sports can also be something you do after dealing with a lot of stress or work. I think now in days families aren't as close as they used to be because we spend to much time on our phones and not so much on the people who care about us.

Technology has advanced a lot in these past years and it is fine that people want to explore new things. If you think about it every sport requires you to run or to keep moving. Activities like sports bring you better things than a tiny screen can.. Very few peoplw know what it's like to actually spend time outside.

Sports are another example, not only are they fun, but they are alsp helping you stay healthy especially if you play almost everyday. Why? Because they always have their noses in their phones and they never take time to go outside",0
"Take the example of the Wright brothers. Knowing the principles of aerodynamic flight, would not have been enough to make them the first to fly in a heavier-than-air craft. That is why imagination can often be more important than knowledge.. It has the power to innovate, to create, and to improve. It can help us generate ideas for dealing with problems, for creating new avenues of income, and for finding more efficient and effective ways of doing almost anything we undertake. It can also be used to help us work though challenging feelings such as fear, anxiety, and even depression. Having knowledge is important, but it's our imagination that often makes the biggest difference. By using imaginative exercises, we can work through our emotions in a healthy, constructive way.

Imagination can be invaluable when combined with knowledge, but it can also be an indispensable tool on its own. 
Imagination has incredible power and can often be far more important than knowledge. By applying our imaginations, we can take something that might seem impossible, and make it a reality.

Imagination can also be a highly useful tool in our work and personal lives. It was their imagination, their belief that they could create something that had never been created before, that allowed them to succeed.

The same is true today. Projects that challenge us to think about different ways of doing something, and to come up with innovative approaches, often benefit more from imaginative thinking than from a deeper understanding of the subject matter. It can help us dream up new possibilities, forge new pathways, and lead us to places we never thought possible",1
"
As a high school student interested in having a successful career and owning my own business by the time I graduate, I need to research what courses I need to take in order to achieve this. Aside from studying, I should research how to get scholarships to help pay for college tuition and explore other jobs that can help me gain experience at a young age, such as working part-time jobs. This will help me gain the essential experience and knowledge I need to build a strong foundation for my future.. I should also research the benefits of committing to a career while still in high school, and look into taking online courses to gain more experience",1
"People that have enthusiasm will most likely to take the quote to their own hearts that doesn't want to quit or gives up yet. A lot of people learn from their own failures in the past for doing something that wasn't easy for their own lives. So here comes the reasons of enthusiasm in the quote.

Learning something new that actually comes up great. People should take the quote like it's a everyday thing in life    . Although some people don't agree with this quote for being negative,however others and I agree of the enthusiasm quote because to learn something new in life and to make mistakes for something great later.

Do you agree with the Former Prime Minister Of England Winston Churchill quote? There others take this quote in a positive way or in a negative way. Like the quote says from failure to failure that will follow up to a pursuit of success. Negativity is the main point that they fail to fail without trying the best and the enthusiasm with them in life it's worthless to them in life.

Although some people don't agree with this quote for being negative,however others and I agree of the enthusiasm quote because to learn something new in life and to make mistakes for something great later. So they don't have the positive attitude and thinks about nothing at all. With this quote I agree with the power of the enthusiasm in lives. Like if you failed a lot and that you learn from your own mistakes from those mistakes will do something greater in the future.

Others may disagree that quote doesn't fit right their own selves and for being negative. Others careless about the enthusiasm how it will help for their lifetime. And it's better to make mistakes for something greater later in life. Like example someone wants to speak a different language but failed many times,that actually doesn't wants to give up on the language that trying to learn",0
"That's when students want to give them a better life by bringing them here. To graduate one year earlier, students must take extra online classes or elective courses. However or whenever students graduate but parents want them all to graduate and make their future bright. They graduate in three years and get a better full time job and help their family with economic problems. . To bring them here, the students have to be able to have enough money and to feed them enough after bringing. It is a good idea to graduate one year earlier and enter college or the work force one year earlier because if students finish high school one year earlier, they can admit into a good colleges and fixed their career little faster for lifetime, they can help their family with economic problems, they can also make their own purchases.

Initially, this idea to finish high school one year earlier is the best idea for them who want to fixed their lifetime career earlier. And students can do all these works earlier if they finish high school in three years instead being in a high school for traditional four years.

Secondly, this idea is good for the students who's entire family already lives here, and there are some economic problem in the family. After all, graduating from school is most important thing in every students life. There are also some good students who always have good grades in all the classes. So, that way their family will not get stuck anywhere for the economic problems.

Finally, this idea to graduate one year earlier is good for them who want to finish high school earlier, to go to college and also to have a part time job on the other hand. Student have permission to graduate high school earlier and enter work force earlier to help their family with economic problems. There are some of the school districts offer programs that allow high schools students to graduate in three years. Some of the student who come from the other countries just by themselves also graduate in three years, may be because their entire family lives in back home.

Suppose, they do not live good life in their back home. Otherwise, they will not get enough credit to graduate in three years instead doing it in traditional four years. So, they can make their own purchases, like phone, paying phone bill, going out to eat with friends, going on a trip with friends, etc.

Students can also have a full time job who do not want to go to college.

There is nothing wrong with graduating from high school in three years by working hard.

Some students do it to make their dream become true faster, some students do it for their family problems, some students do it for their own problems",0
"With the ideas you can influence the choice so it can lead to the right path. If the expert were to guide you, he or she would guide you from their prospective not what you believe in.

You will always have to make tough decisions in life. It can impact you in the future but you will be mature enough to know the right decision. Your opinion matters and will influence your choices in the future. It's a good choice to come up with your own ideas. The choices you make will lead you to success or failure but you have to keep trying. People should not seek guidance from an expert. Some go with their instinct others do mindless choices.

Some of these choices can be personal to tell an expert or maybe your not comfortable. You do not need any expert to tell you about your decision. People in today's generation know what wrong and right is. You need to make the better choice and decide what good and wrong is on the decision. There is no point in paying money for an expert when you can make the choices yourself.

The ideas you have can be very successful and impact your choices. Everyone has their personal choice or opinion they believe in. The expert may have their own opinion on the decision. The ideas you come up with for your for your choice can be a better solution. This will impact you to become a better person to benefit to society.. Possibly, the ideas can persuade the choice you make and will not make you regret it afterwards.

In conclusion, I believe making your own choices and decisions is a better choice. It's your choice and opinion on what you do with what matter comes into your hands",0
"The students will trust each other as a team work or a friends.

Inconlotion relate ship, team work, and truth willy make up a friend ship, and the program that the students will be as a team or a family. This will help the students trust each other will and as a friend or family. Team work can assist there team in game or in praction. The program also help a lot to the students. Also the students will experiment this well there in a program as a team.

Relate ships is a important work with someone else. It can make them real lies relate ship is important to people.

Team work is other thing that is important to the program,because it share friend ship ,and relate ship. Relate ship can also help other people, what they did wrong to people. It will effects a lot of people as a team. Friends can lead up to best friends. The program help both the students by assist each other. The older students show and help the younger students.

Lastly truth willy is very important, because it is part of people life. . The both students will get more friends and look each other. Also the program can make these students become friends. The effects of students gets involved of a program, is relate ship,teamwork, and truth willy because all this thing builds up like a friend ship. Truth willy will make program better and truth willy to other people",0
"For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him.

Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he won't get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we won't have to turn in it late. This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources.

As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I don't agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they aren't really saving energy

Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesn't.

Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, let's use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. We don't know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we don't have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesn't have, which make us a different environment than the business. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers.

My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybody's benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the school's main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. . Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments.

However, teacher's opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they aren't robots who are just set up by the government",0
"Moreover, a group work can make learning more passionate.

In conclusion, working alone is beneficial because it can save our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because all the group can share information and that can bring a faster work. Working alone can save our time because we can work at home, we don't need to wait for the rest of the group or even go somewhere else. I agree that working with teammates can help us feel better and they push us to be better . Although some say working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information and work fast.

Some say that working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time. For example, before doing a class work I always have to ask my teacher if what I'm thinking is correct because my mind gets freeze out. Furthermore, some child think better if one person gives them an idea. It means that working with a group is a great benefit, it help us to have better thoughts.

Working with a group can bring joy to our soul by making new friends. Have you ever been in a situation where you feel alone and you don't want to do any homework. It is true that many heads think better than one because if one comes with an idea then all together discuss about it. A survey showed that a faster way to work is working in groups because all the team can work in different areas at the same time. We enjoyed talking and eating but we never talked about the project. All I can say, we all just waste our time.

However, working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information. Working alone doesn't help in answering doubt that we could have.

Also, working with a group is a great benefit because we can work fast. Thank you for taking your time to read my paper, I hope you understand why I prefer working with a group.. For example, last year, my Science teacher gave us a group assignment where we needed to meet each other outside of school. We can work and have fun, also working with a team is great because we can talk not just about the project, but our lives. That day my group and I talked where to see each other, then we went to Generic_Name's house. All the group can work at the same time, some can do the posters, others can look for information, and the rest can divide the information about what theme each one is going to talk during the presentation. It has been said that working with a group benefit more than working alone because it can be more fun",0
"                             . We have to share informations to each other.

We can connect with each other the Technology not only do Shopping online, Playing games is also to connect with each other in Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp etc. Not everyone want you to be perfect there is people want they only to be perfect but still you have to ask and connect with the others you can take the information and leave them if they are not good because no is Perfect in our Life and every were. don't trust everyone. We have to connect with bad people and the good people because the bad people we can take the informations from them and the good we can take informations and the good habites also if you know only few peoples is better than you live without any one and only doing all things you know it only.

Private life is Perfect life but not too much we not talk too each other and know information at some time there is limits in our talking with people because not all people give you all informations correct there is bad people can give you the informations and when you do it you will go the police, or you get in terrible with this person. If the Technology is limits it will be bored life and the Technology will be bored if we have limits to connect with people there is some people will say no the technology is bored for Example: people like to chat 24 hours to each other if there is limits the life will be bored.

Ok it is good not speak to each other everyday but we have to be connect with the world around us.

Know what is happening in there Country there is a Fires, Earthquakes etc. Negative, We have to take Information about the Books, Play games etc. My Sister know how to do Shopping online than she will tell me how to do the shopping online, and I

will say to here how to bring the books online like that she tell information and I tell her Information now she know all the informations about books and I know all the Informations about the shopping. Ok We do what we want, but not everthing we do it is correct There is will be correct some will be incorrect because we don't know all the information about this games, books, shop etc.

Everyone in the world not have all the information for Example: I know how to bring the books online",0
"Shopping has also become easier, allowing people to order what they need from any location and have it delivered directly to them. Through libraries, people can discover books from all over the world without leaving their home. Nevertheless, it is important to be mindful of its possible dangers and be conscious of the way it can be used. In summary, technology makes many activities more convenient and improves the quality of our lives, offering access to crucial information, easier shopping options, and a world of gaming opportunities.. By browsing the wealth of information available online, people can access books, shop, and play games in a few clicks. 

In conclusion, the advantages of technology are evident in the way it helps us with our daily activities. 
The use of technology in modern times has had a significant impact on people's lives, making everyday tasks easier, more convenient, and safer than ever before. Games also benefit from technology, allowing players to compete in real-time from different places around the world. Technology has made life easier and more enjoyable and its impact will continue to be felt in the years to come",1
"Many schools are agree that students can finish high school in three years. In my opinion is a good idea to finish high school in three years, because the students can take class before school or after school, then, they can graduate in three years instead four years, instead elective courses, the students can take class, they need for graduate, and the students will have more time to go to college.

The students can take class before school or after school, and they can graduate in three years instead four years. If the students finish high school in three years, they will go early to the college.

The students will have more time to study in college. The students can use the time, that they uses for the elective courses, they can use it for the classes they need for graduate. The students will have time to think, what they want to study in college. However, some students think that is tired to come early to the school, or stay after school.

Instead elective courses, the students can take classes, that they need for graduate. However, some students think, they need four years in high school for to be very prepare for college. If, the students stay four years in high school, they will not have enough time to study two careers. The students will have time to think, which college they want to go.

I believe that is better finish college in three yeras, because the students get more time to go to college, so, when they finish their career. The elective courses it does not prepare to the students for college, and the regular classes prepare them for college. The students can come one hour early, before school start, and they can take class every day of school, or they can stay one hour after school to take the class. Also, the students can finish very early their career. Then, they can study another career, because they will still young. Many students think that is a good idea to finish high school in three years. If, them finish two career, they will have a lot of opportunities to get a good job, and have a good pay.. Some students think that they are waste time in four years in high school",0
"They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation.

I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit.. DISTANCE LEARNING

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job",0
"In a classroom setting, students have the opportunity to directly interact with teachers and other students, which can foster collaboration and discussion and help deepen one's understanding of the material. On the other hand, there can often be distractions in the classroom, such as other students talking or texts and emails buzzing, that can disrupt one's focus. 

No matter what setting it takes place in, effective learning happens when one takes responsibility for their own learning and is willing and motivated to make the most of any environment.. As well, if a student finds they are struggling with a topic, they can usually take more time to go back over it without feeling rushed or put on the spot. However, without direct feedback from a teacher or other students, some learners may feel too isolated or lack the motivation to stay on track. 

In contrast, learning in a home setting can be incredibly effective, as there is usually fewer distractions and a more relaxed environment. 
Learning in a classroom setting and in a home setting both have distinct advantages and disadvantages",1
"   . Well if you want to make something that you always wanted to do or you wanted to have you will failed sometimes but you never have give up with out loos your enthusiasm like the statement said because if you always give up in things that are harder to you to do it you will always be like that and them you will never going to be waht you always wanted to be some reasons are the you have to superate in the life bacause life not always is easy to live sometimes you will have some troubles without you don't expect that it will come.

Examples are that if you are wasting your time doing things that are going to ruin your life you will always failure and you will loose your enthusiasm and if you don't think what you are doing one day you can do something that you will never wanted to do in your life and there is where going to be seriuos problems with the police and you will jail for a couple years.

So that's why you will need to be always positive with things that you wanted to do in your life never think that you will never going to make your dream because you can make it thare are people that love your family so you will never going to be alone some reasons are that if you make your dream that you always wanted to be and your family are working hard to help you they are going to be so proud of you them you will said thanks god for all you give me and you will be so appreciated with your family because without them will never do what you always wanted to be a good person you will have a good work and you will going to have that car that you always dream to have when you was a kid.

Nobody likes to fails even if it's something that you don't wanted to happen at you or someone else that you love or eather something material because it's harder to buy something or other thing that cost you alot of money and some else just come to break it or destroy that thing that you love and you take care of it like that was only thing that you will love in your whole life.

An importamt failure will be something that happen to you and you said I know i can't superate this and be better than I was before so you can have better ideas how be sucesful in life and don't comitte mistakes that just a child a child can comitte so that can an important failure.

Also taht's why i can not be agree baecause I think both needs to be the same but not both can be the same but with the help of anyone both statement can be equal",0
". For example, if someone is wearing bright colors and interacting boisterously, they may be categorized as irresponsible. It’s important to remember that these characteristics are skills, and a person must actively work on honing their character in order to become a better person. 

It is for these reasons why having a good character is essential in everyday life. Friends and family can be more confident in the trustworthiness of the person, and colleagues can potentially become more productive as a direct result. 
In this day and age, it is important to take the time to carefully consider one’s own character traits and the implications that they can have. Oftentimes, people make snap judgments based solely on the way somebody interacts with others or what they’re wearing on any given day. On the other hand, someone in a more toned-down ensemble and keeping to themselves may be perceived as introverted or shy. In order to ensure that each person is in their best possible state of mind, it is important to take the time and effort to work on the self and improve their character. It is important to consider that these assumptions are not always accurate, and that each person’s character is unique to them. Acquiring these skills can help minimize conflict or difficult social interactions, and can make living a happy and successful life much easier. It should be noted that having a good character is not only beneficial for the individual, but also those around them. 

Having a “good character” is a term often used to describe those with admirable traits, such as being honest, generous, and respectful",1
"Some educators and parents have posited that students could experience a “work smarter, not harder” approach with four days to spread their work out over the extended school day, promote student-driven learning, and potentially have classes that are more engaging. Having four days of school instead of five may result in more hours of scarce study time, more challenging teacher expectations, and more cumulative material to cover. On the one hand, four days of school can be fewer school days in a week and may allow students to feel less overwhelmed with work and have more free time to do what they love. This could lead to excessive stress on students, longer days of being in a focused state, and ultimately exhaustion. 

On the other hand, the extended school days might put an overwhelming amount of pressure on students. It is essential that a thorough analysis of these potential changes to the educational system be done to foster an environment that is conducive to long-term student success.. 

In conclusion, the pros and cons of extending the school day and having four days a week are complex and varied. Additionally, there may be a potential financial burden that may come with the extended school days, such as the need to hire more staff and administration and the potential for less hands-on learning if resources are cut. 
Extending the school day can be both a blessing and a curse for students. 

Despite the potential drawbacks, there are potential benefits from having four days of school. With the extended school day, students may be able to engage in more in-depth learning, be able to learn at a faster pace, and have more individualized attention in classes as the school day is more spread out. It could also result in less time overall that children spend on screens or electronic devices throughout the week, as they will have more days free to explore and engage in activities with friends and family",1

Overall, personal growth and development starts with understanding the importance of being honest and authentic in life. 

Throughout my life, I’ve experienced many people who were dishonest and inauthentic. We have the ability to choose who we invest our time in, and I have learned that it’s better to choose wisely.. With more experience under my belt, I eventually became better at recognizing bad relationships and toxic people. 
Growing up, my parents instilled in me at an early age the importance of authenticity and honesty. I discovered that the more I was honest about who I was, the easier it was for me to be surrounded by positive individuals who pushed me to reach my goals and dreams. Trying to fit in and please these people was a mistake, as they only brought me down and it was not the healthy environment that I needed to grow and succeed. This made me understand the importance of setting boundaries and being comfortable with saying no - something that is still valuable to me today. Setting boundaries and not putting up with toxic people is the best way to make wiser, healthier relationships in the long run. From a young age, I learned that if I choose to be truthful and honest, I will likely make wiser decisions in life and build better relationships",1
"Doing anything will not help you if you want to be someone in the life. Also you have to believe in yourself and take off negative persons of your life.. I think we accomplish if we are always doing something, because it will help you to learn more things, we have to always stay busy doing something if we want to achieve. If you just watch videos on YouTube and don't do anything, that will not help you to get it, you have to put on practice to get it.

Another example is if you will have a test and you want to get an A, you have to studies your notes and not be lazy, if you just go to take the test without know anything, you will fail the test, you have to be a positive person, feel comfortable, and believe in yourself.

In conclusion if we want to be a successful person, we never have to be idle, and we have to always stay busy doing something, always be positive, see the potential you have and feel able to do everything you want, and never be inactive, you have to be an active person to reach your goals. One reason to stay busy doing something is that will help you to develop new things, and focus doing things that you like to do, and see your potential and be able to do anything you have in mind.

Another reason is that doing something will help you to open your brain, and think positive, also have big ideas that will be very helpful for your life, if we want to be a successful person, never have to be idle. For example if you want to be a professional soccer player you have to train and work very hard everyday on it to get it, practice skills, develop your abilities",0
"Is important to learn from other people experiences? The answer is yes, because they don't want you to do the same that they did. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it. Is that when he had the same that I have, he use to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. One day, you are about to do something wrong, but then you realized that someone that you know did it before, and they had already tell you that it didn't went well. Next, when people tell you their experiences, they want you to do better them what they did. In my point of view, learning the experiences of others is important, because you learn something that someone had already commit that mistake and they tell you not to do when you grow.

First, one person that had shared their experiences with me is one of my friend. In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. He had tell me plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. Almost every week he used to lived the house without permission. Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life.. Even that someone had already tell you not to do it.

Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they don't want you to do the same mistake. had tell you plethora of their experiences that they had. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything.

Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. One of the experiences that he had tell me. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stop going out of the house without permission. You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake.

"life is never easy. Cause if you do look down you won't see your bright future that will come.

Do good things in your life. if we dont how can we know things will get better.

We need to have hope to learn the lesson.

The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind.

For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. Everything will get better. Always look up never down. Nothing but to hope that they will get better. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick. . It helped me a lot. Enjoy it bore it ends.

Everyone goes through something in their life. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. Like be nice to people don't be rude, disrespectful, and mean. But then i realized why am i thinking negative? and not trying. How is this going to help me in life. life is full of lessons that will teach us something. But that didn't help. We need to believe, have hope in life. Just don't think negative. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson.

Don't rush things in your life. You don't know what can happen if you rush things in life. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. I opened my eyes and began to try. Because when you grow up you won't be able to go back

In the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. I would share that life is not easy. Enjoy your life as much as you can. Don't take your anger out on others. I started to believe. what's the point of being mean. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. thats how life is. enjoy your childhood. I didn't have hope. Give things time, be patient. Life teaches us a lesson. Taking your anger out on someone who didn't do anything is not going to help. Things got harder for me. That's not going to help you in life. Its's making the problem worse",0

"Regardless of the approach, it is important to consider the consequences of both methods and to choose wisely.. 
It is important to understand the ways in which you can influence another person. There is a difference between talking to someone about your personal experience versus talking softly and calmly about their behaviour. When discussing your experience, you may get the person to empathise with your point of view and possibly adjust their behaviour accordingly. This method is gentler and can encourage the other person to act in the desired way. Talking softly and calmly focuses more on pushing the person towards a goal",1
"Also, so they don't get too stressed out for it.

If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. Personally I think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. So he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. Also, they think their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably like in their senior year. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. That's the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job.

The second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they don't get stressed out too much.             . If you know what you want to do then you'll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you won't have to take extra classes for no reason. So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. Also if you need help don't hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. No, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, don't even have a plan, and would just be stressed out.

In conclusion, in society they think that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. The other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. The other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Finally, Generic_Name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. On september 2, 2015 Generic_Name was entering his first year of high school, and already knew what he wanted to do with his life, and that was to be a doctor, but was having trouble on what kind of doctor he wanted to be. If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. That's the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they don't get stressed out too much.

Some people would disagree with me because they think it's ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is know what classes you would need to take. Took all of the classes he needed to be one. The more you ask for help the less you'll be stressed. Those are the reasons why i agree with this statement. In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. They say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school.

The first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why",0
"The students have to spend time with their family a lot as possible they can. Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the school's work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a school's stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. After it, the students are more prepared to star the school's year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the school's work. The summer break is made to a students's benefit, it help the students as a relajation during the summer. Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and don't take the school's time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools. I am not agree with those educators that say, the summer break is too long and the students can't retain imformation as easily when they return in the fall. Finally, the student does't need the summer break shorter, they have a lot of things to do during the summer break, and it would't be justly to them, I am againt to the educators that feel the summer break is too long.. That is why I am not agree the educators that does't wants the summer break long.

One reason,the students are in the school almost a whole year, and all that time they are stressed by all the work they have to do in the school. Some of them need to make money, and they take the summer break to make it. Second reason, during the school's time the students does't have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family",0

"One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudn't because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. They say some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades.

One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we can't change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home. I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. I had a problem at freshman year that i've got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didn't knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudn't have to face this problem every school day. All the schools should have online classes that you can take at home so every student can study the way they want to study;Therefore, students benefit by being able to attend classes at home.. Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace.

Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you don't have people around you to stop you or distract you. In this case being abble to attend school at home helps a lot of students.

Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people, One of my favorite soccer player once said that ""the only thing that attending school at home does not help is at socializing, meeting new people."" that's of the reason not a lot people attend school at home, because they like to meet new friends, being together with people that you like.

Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, you can focus more and you is a option that you can take if you have any obstacle in your way at school such as bullying or something like that, nowadays is more common to see people taking online classes",0

"Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. He is attending one class online from his home. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. For example, my friend Generic_Name. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. She said yes. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class.

Extending school days or adopting a four day school week can be a viable way for schools to promote conserving energy and resources. Furthermore, it could give students more time to practice energy conservation habits such as recycling, reducing water usage, and the unplugging of electronics when not in use. On the other hand, adopting a four day school week could help reduce the amount of energy needed to transport students, as fewer buses and cars would be necessary. On one hand, extending school days means that a school can do more to conserve energy as they can turn off certain lights or air conditioners earlier each day. However, a shorter school week could mean that students would have less time to learn in class, potentially leading to a disruption in their academic progress.. This would in turn reduce emissions and the amount of energy needed for those transport vehicles",1

your future can be successful.

"I think that work in groups is more benefit. Also, it makes the students to do better workers and meet people. Here are some reason why

I think that work in groups is benefit.

First, They can divide the work in same parts. But when the group decide what to do and they finish the work fast. Second, In a group decide what to do it can be hard. And the last one can make the presentation and make the work creative.

Second, In groups can take less time to work on it that working alone. therefore, work in groups is benefit for students and teacher. First, work in group can be a good for class because they can know each other. Because there will not fight or enmity so the class can work more successfully. If the class work in group they can do much better in the work that working alone because they can do the work more easily by working as a team. And, It will make the class more fun because everyone can help each other in thing that are hard for people. For example, if one student can't understand the topic he can ask for help to the teacher and he can ask to people around hem for help.

In conclusion, work as a group is funny and make the class better. While someone is working in searching information the other one can think in how to make the work more creative. If a class is works more successfully that makes the topic easy and knowing each other makes the class more understanding. Also, they can search for information more faster then alone because they can divide the work but they can also help each other. If the class meet each other the class can be more successful. also, the students can know each other and they can meet new people. This are some reasons why a think that work in groups is better.. So, the group can have more opportunity to have a better grade.

Third, Work as a group can also be fun because you are working with your friends or you can met new people. therefore, I think that work will be better in groups because the class can meet and know each other and they can be better person and better students. If a group meet in one place and they start working they can easily finish the work on time. Also, if they divide the work is more fair for the group so they can have more opportunity to work successfully. The other two can be checking that the writing is good and that the information is good. Because work is groups make the class successful. For example, If the class works in groups of 4 they can do a good work by dividing the work in same parts like one can be searching for information the other one can be looking for imagines. The group can check if the work is good or not and decide either to keep the information o to make some changes. Second, They have more opportunity to have a better work",0
"Positive thinking has been linked to decreased stress and anxiety, and even improved heart health. It also helps us stay motivated and reach our goals. It can help us put our best foot forward and achieve more than we ever thought possible.

There are numerous advantages to having a positive attitude. It can lead to better physical, mental, and emotional health as well as increased motivation and productivity. It is also associated with improved mental faculties such as concentration and memorization.

Finally, having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. Living with a positive attitude is a key factor in achieving our goals. With a positive attitude, we can turn any challenge into an opportunity and become the best versions of ourselves.. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. In addition, a positive attitude can help us create and maintain relationships, solve problems more effectively, and feel better about ourselves.

Moreover, a positive attitude also affects our physical wellbeing. The more positive we are, the more effort we can put into achieving our goals. For instance, it allows us to stay optimistic and open-minded despite challenges",1
"Starting your career with prior knowledge before becoming an adult will make it easier to obtain a job once you graduate high school. That many positive outcomes will come out of starting early. Being young shows a lot of both positive and negative benefits.

Early experience for these students can benefit future jobs. Those adults think that students should wait until they are older to make that type of decision.

Having students start early come with so many benefits for there future. Others say that they are not ready to choose and commit to a career. So, I believe that students can commit to a career at a young age in high school. Also they have better oppurtunites and better chances with getting there perfered career. So, when you start cooking at a restaurant you will know how to stop from ruining the food. A boost of confidence is what students need before going into something.

On the other hand, people say that having students commit to career in high school is a bad idea. For example, students are constantly changing there mind and changing there interests. Your chances for a job are much higher then those without any experience.

Making less mistakes because of all the prior knowledge you learned beforehand. They get to learn more in advance then the rest. Starting young will prevent less mistakes from happening in your future job. So, they think how can a student choose something for the rest of there life if they can't decide on some of the most simplest decisions. This will help students have some confidence since they know what to expect going into they're career. Those who choose to wait after high school will have a harder time seeking a job. For example, you take a class for cooking and seek for a job you will have a better chance then those who have no experience. If in high school should young students be capable of committing to a career.      . The age shouldn't determined how committed you can be to a career. Some adults say they are to young to commit to a career because of how uncertain they are when they make decisions. I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. Some adults say that young students should pick a career. This gives the students a better resume if they know what they are capable of doing and doesn't need to be taught. Before entering a career it's good that students can relax and feel better since they know how everything will go. Having less mistakes during the job will show your bosses that you know what you are doing for them.

The students will have some confidence before going into their career. For example, you take a class for cooking and you start learning early how to stop from burning your food. For example, you learn about the kitchen and what everything does so when you go in you won't expect anything new",0
"

Take, for example, the choices we make in our friendships. They are our primary caretakers and our first models for behavior, values and beliefs. On the flip side, those we choose to associate with also influence our values, morals and overall character. 
As humans, we are constantly influenced by the people and environments around us. As we interact with the world, the experiences we have and the ideas we are exposed to shape who we become. We usually pick people who share similar values and perspectives, and those who can act as mentors, motivate and inspire us. Studies show that family dynamics greatly shape our personalities, particularly when it comes to adherence to social values. These influences have a major impact on our characters and how we view ourselves. 

In conclusion, our characters are formed by the people and influences around us, from the small and seemingly insignificant details with which we come into contact with, to the significant conversations and interactions with our families, to the sociocultural dynamics with which we are surrounded. Culture and environment directly shape how our behavior, values, goals and behavior are shaped. 

Our parents are the people who usually have the strongest influence on our development. Our upbringing, either in an authoritarian or democratic family, in an organized or chaotic home, in an accepting and nurturing environment or in an unsafe one, all shape our character and attitude toward the world. Parents often pass on their history, their memories, and their beliefs, helping to shape our character, attitude and disposition. All together, these factors shape our values, behaviors and vision for life.. 

Family environment also has an impact on our characters. 

Similarly, culture and society play an important role in the shaping our character. The people we associate with, our families, our culture, our environment, our education, and our personal experiences – all contribute to the shaping of our character",1
"It's important to keep practicing to master the skill, so this is what I'll do until I achieve my goal. I will also research and learn the necessary concepts required, such as data types and loops. To achieve this, I've decided to break the goal down into smaller steps. 
My goal is to learn to code in Python. Once I'm comfortable with the basics, I'll start to try out skills I have learned and read the related materials. For example, I plan to begin by watching online tutorials, and then move onto reading beginner books about the language. I'll also take part in forums and ask for feedback from experts. Finally, I won't give up no matter what - I've set a goal, and I'm determined to reach it.",1
"From racial discrimination to being overshadowed by white jazz musicians, Ellington faced a number of obstacles in his attempt to become one of the great jazz legends. I believe that if we learn to view problems and challenges as opportunities to push ourselves and uncover our hidden strengths, then nothing is ever truly impossible.. With hard work, dedication, and a positive attitude, anyone can find a way to reach the goal. 
Duke Ellington dedicated his nearly 50-year career to perfecting the jazz genre in an era that didn't always accept him and his music. Despite the odds, Ellington persevered and overcame these challenges with determination, finely honed skills, and his unflinching faith in jazz.

Ellington’s inspiring words, ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" echoes his own journey and offers a crucial life lesson. Any obstacle can be a great opportunity to grow and achieve something that may have seemed impossible before",1
"I imagine it to be a vibrant and exciting place, with a unique culture and plenty of attractions.

I am sure that the people of Generic_City are some of the most welcoming and hospitable people I have ever met. 

I am sure visiting Generic_City would be a lovely and memorable experience. It would be a one-of-a-kind experience to explore and fully take in all the wonders of this fascinating city.

Visiting Generic_City has been something I have been dreaming of ever since I first heard about the city and its friendly atmosphere. It would be a pleasure to be able to explore the unique personality of the city and get to know the people that call it home. They are a diverse group that respects all kinds of cultures and backgrounds, making it an extremely open-minded area to visit. I would love to be able to experience this firsthand.

"However, it is also important to consider the risks associated with partaking in these activities as well; for example, scams, identity theft, and digital addiction. 

In the current digital age, online activities, such as shopping, playing games, and connecting with people on social media sites, have revolutionized the way in which groups of people interact. There are numerous potential benefits of engaging with these activities, such as the ease of access to people outside of your geographical area or the ability to purchase items without leaving your house. Undoubtedly, it can be beneficial to remain digitally connected with the world and have access to others’ insights and opportunities, however, it is also crucial to keep in mind that not everyone needs to know all the information about other people. Maintaining the boundaries between private and public information can be difficult in our current online-focused culture, and therefore requires dedicated effort in order to do so. 

We live in a world where staying connected is becoming increasingly important; however, with these connections come some important caveats. Thus, it is important to remain connected with the digital world, in order to keep up with the changing times, while also establishing limits on just how much time and energy are put into these activities.",1
"Everyone has different values and experiences that shape the person they become, and it is important to take the time to recognize how these elements create who we are.. 

Morals are the values that we have developed throughout our lives and that guide us in decision making. They shape our conscience and give us direction in moments of doubt or struggle. In addition, they inform us of our beliefs, attitudes, and preferences. People from different social classes may have different sets of morals and values due to their different upbringings and backgrounds. For example, a moral principle such as not stealing can discourage a person from taking shortcuts or engaging in other criminal activities. In essence, morals are the compass of our lives which leads us in making good character decisions.

Class also plays a role in how a person's character is formed. For example, someone who grew up in a wealthy family may have a different view of debating than someone who was raised in a low-income household. Moreover, they learn from the example of the people around them and can learn how to handle different situations and what to expect when in different scenarios.

In conclusion, morals, social class, and people are all key contributors to the formation of a person's character. As an individual's life progresses, these characteristics take on different meanings and meanings, ultimately contributing to personal growth, identity, and decisions. 
Moral values and social classes play an integral role in the formation of a person's character. People who are surrounded by positive and strong influences in their lives tend to have higher self-esteem and are less susceptible to acting prematurely or rashly. How one perceives these different codes of conduct dictates one’s character.

Finally, the people that a person surrounds themselves with have a significant influence on their character",1
"Taking an active and productive approach to life thus provides us with the opportunity to maximize our potential in a wide range of fields while still allowing us to maintain our overall wellbeing.. Examples include Bill Gates, whose focus on innovation and productivity revolutionized the technology industry; Elon Musk, who applied his productive approach to several industries including space exploration and automobile engineering; and Oprah Winfrey, who used her productive approach to create her own media empire from scratch.

Productivity leads to success and health in three key ways. By learning how to be productive and organized in our approach, we can keep track of our objectives and goals, make the most of our resources, pursue our dreams and ambitions, and develop a meaningful impact in both our lives and the lives of others. Lastly, it provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which is often essential for both our physical and psychological well-being.

In conclusion, it can be seen that productivity is a fundamental ingredient for achieving success and good health. Through heightened productivity, one is able to actively pursue their goals, often with swiftness, efficiency and effectiveness. Firstly, it enables us to make the most of our time by allocating our resources efficiently. This generates more time for rest and leisure, thus providing an opportunity for people to maintain and improve their overall wellbeing. 
Being productive is a powerful tool for achieving success and good health. As such, many successful individuals throughout history have attributed much of their success partly or entirely to their productivity. Secondly, pursuing objectives efficiently through productivity can lead to tangible results, such as financial prosperity, which itself leads to better physical and mental health",1
"                                                                                                                                . They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they don't have experience to be singing or drawing. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year.

Second reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. It's hard when some students can't do what others can do at drama or musics. I've told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasn't great at it. They wouldn't stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because it'll stress them out.

Last reason, students shouldn't take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. Some students can't multi-task if they do drama class and math at the same time. They won't have to stress about their grades to be below F if they don't take the electives. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. It'll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. It's better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives.

Therefore, these are the reasons why students shouldn't be required to take classes in arts, musics, or drama. I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. In my opinion, students should take electives instead of music, drama, or arts. It'll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes.

For example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. They would have to focus on the important things that they're good at. Students shouldn't be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves.

One reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit",0

In conclusion, it is undeniably true that individuals who have an active ambition to strive towards their goals will become more successful than those who do not, as stated by Thomas Jefferson. He did not simply wait for his goals to come to fruition; instead, he was actively involved in every step of the creation process, from in-depth market research to detailed product testing and design.

In contrast, there are those who fail to reach their dreams because they do not strive to actively pursue their goals. Achieving one’s ambitions does not come easy, and for those willing to work hard, the rewards can be great.. Those who do not have a clear focus do not tend to be willing to make sacrifices or take risks to push themselves further. To illustrate this idea, we can consider the example of Steve Jobs: an ambitious man who sought to revolutionize the world of technology. For example, many aspiring entrepreneurs will not risk their financial security in order to invest in their ideas, as they are not motivated to work towards their dreams. They will create tangible plans, allowing them to establish deadlines and strides in reaching their goals. His words have a powerful resonance in our present day, for it is clear that those who act on their dreams and goals can achieve far more than those who do not. 

When examining individuals who actively strive to reach their ambitions, the key component is the clear focus on their objectives. To put it simply: having an active attitude of determination and ambition can truly bring success. 
Thomas Jefferson once famously declared that “nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude""",1
"That really caught my attention, as I begged my mom to buy me it. My dad had made me a daily schedule for me to practice everything, so I could increase my talent and abilites. Eventually, she gave in and bought me the toy violin. I always enjoyed playing the violin, but it began a chore. I saw a kid magazine with a toy violin that came along with it.          . After countless of arguments, cries, and rants to friend, I realized that no one can convince me to enjoy the violin again instead, I had to convince myself to. During the last two years of the four, in Generic_City I had be slacking off from my practices. After a few years went, I had moved to Generic_City and my parents decided I should actually get lessons on the violin in 2013. Yet, I still wanted to continue with my talent and not give up. The violin is a hard instrument to master, even with many years. I also grew to enjoying the violin more. I thought to myself, why did I hate practicing and going to lessons so much? The violin is something that I could never let go of because of the amount of work and years put into it. Soon, came to my realization that the violin is something you could not master in just in a year. That's how I was able to go through the ""first phase"" of violin lessons went by.

Saturday afternoons felt super weird since I was not attending any lessons. I pretended like it was a real violin, and strung the strings with my fake bow. They had told me it would be a waste of six years worth of money for me to give up. It was dejavu all over again from 7 years ago. I was not improving as much, as I was back in Generic_City. It felt great knowing I was off to a great start.

Everything was going fine for the next five months, until I started to slack off again but worse. It could really be just a phase you could be having. Somethings skills you would want to have is patience, knowing to push yourself to a current limit, and enjoying it. You can tell if someone is doing something they clearly don't want to do, but are forcing themselves. I always had a great amount of interest in violins as a kid. I still practiced and slightly improved, but I still unhappy. I really thought I was going to be perfect on the first day. I did not feel happy about the violin for the next three years. It takes hours and hours of practices and skill to enjoy putting your time into it. But you can give a lot of time to decide whether or not you will ever be happy from doing something you don't currently want to do. The new instructor said I was pretty good and could immediately start on the second book, instead of the first ""beginners"" book. That is how I grew my skills, and my talent in violin more. We were at a gas station on a road trip, and stopped to eat. With those skills, my talent on the violin has increased over the years and overcame phases.

When I first shown interest in violins, as I remember, was in Generic_City back in 2008. Of course, I was not good at all on day one. On the first lesson, I felt really nervous because my wish was finally coming true. The best feeling is honestly really great knowing that you weren't pushing yourself to do something you didn't want to do anymore. The thoughts of how the violin was not going to take me anywhere always lingered in my mind. Suddenly, everything felt like the very first lesson I took in 2013. Reasons just kept piling up till I told my parents about my thoughts and feelings. It was not my dream to be a famous violinist or an instructor. Ever since I had gotten that toy violin, I would not stop bringing it everywhere with me. I would love to improve on my talent more instead of throwing it all out, it would be a big waste to do so.

You should always push yourself to a current limit though, not until you breakdown. Our family was moving once again, but to Virginia. Every since we left Generic_City, I had not touched a violin in a year and that is when I was reminiscing on the days when I was playing the violin. My family and I had moved back to Generic_City, and I did not have any violin lessons. After a few months went by in Generic_City, I begged my parents to let me take lessons on violin. We found out there was after-school lessons I could take. Soon enough, I was given lessons for the violin",0
"Thankyou for hearing me today!!

Have a great day!!. Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change and I asked to other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good, it also can be that they don't treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act in a different way I thought that it's a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer.

My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely,for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school anymore I only wanted to have fun; this year I havent moved but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I don't feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really don't want to leave them (the people here are great).

In some reasons the people don't treat everybody the same way because each persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it hap pend to me one time and I really didn't like it; it was one time that I went to a party and I was going to meat up with a group of friends wen I got there they didn't want to talk to me I wondered why but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them and it was because they told them something that I didn't even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didn't tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me so things got fixed and we went to party all night and to have fun.

The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act in a different way because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they can't control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he can't control his character but they were teachers that will explain what he had and they would be better and not say things about hem.

Well now that we sow all this I think that I am correct people don't always be be perfect, everybody makes errors in life or someone causes them",0

"Instead of feeling overwhelmed with the project, I could focus on understanding the concepts I was presented with, and use that knowledge to come up with my own creative solutions or ideas. 

Research has also suggested that when teachers structure and guide learning, it leads to better academic outcomes for students. Instead of having to think of an idea from scratch, I had a framework to work off of – the challenge was figuring out ways to take that project and make it my own. 

In conclusion, having teachers design projects provides many benefits for students that they wouldn’t experience if they were designing them on their own. Specifically, when teachers designed projects, students reported feeling more confident and comfortable in their learning environment. In my experience, having a teacher-designed project gave me a starting point to expanding my knowledge and learning. A study published in the International Journal of Research and Reviews in Applied Sciences showed that when students were given guidance, structure and support, their overall learning experience improved. 
When it comes to classrooms, having teachers design projects for students can be just as beneficial as having students come up with their own ideas. It is an effective way to guide student learning and understanding, while still allowing students to express their creativity and come up with their own solutions.",1
"In addition, having a commitment to a career can provide the focus and outcome necessary to have a successful future. By understanding their future goals and connecting these to the learning process, it can help to engage them in their work and give them a renewed energy for pursuing their dreams. 
As being a high school student can be a challenging time, it is important to consider the different career options available. It is beneficial to reflect on not only the career itself, but the benefits that can be gained from such a choice. For example, having clear career objectives and commiting to this can help to motivate students to stay focused during their studies. By researching potential career pathways while in high school, students can find an option that will best suit their interests and provide the benefits needed to achieve success.",1

During years had been existed a question among be yourself and be like the people wants you to be; in this time I'm agree with the author when he say,"" to be yourself is the greatest accomplishment in this world that is trying constantly to make you someone else,"" because there is a lot of people that shows indifference with you, only because of the way you think , or for simples things like how you wear, the music you like, or how you like to live.

Be yourself is one of the best things that exists in this world, because you don't have to act different in front of the other people just to be accepted, one of the advantages to be yourself is, if you are loved by someone for how you are, you don't be afraid to hurt that person because of your bad actions.

Otherwise, we also can get benefits for being how the world wants you to be, for example in your job, you are getting pay for all your effort working hard although you want to do it or not.

Nevertheless, in this world we alway are controlled by someone no matter what",0
"she got the answers the error words which she didn't know. there would be less social interactions, because they won't be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they don't want to work.

some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school.

Secondly, there would be less social interaction. Students get more help from teachers. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time.

In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldn't make you stressful. Therefore, Learning from public school it won't have distractions that a online has. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated.

Firstly, students would cheat easier. It would be more helpful if students come to school.

Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. . For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers won't helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. However, Students won't lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more",0
"My own experiences have taught me that first impressions can be difficult to get right, yet they can have a lasting impression on how I am viewed and perceived by others. Over time, I have come to recognize that it isn't always the first words or gestures that matter, but rather how I engage with someone that is most important. From the way I introduce myself to someone new, to the way I greet a friend when we meet, I know that the small details of an initial interaction can have a tremendous impact on how people feel about one another. This shift in my understanding of first impressions has helped me to connect more authentically with others.. 
I have always been aware of the power of first impressions",1
"beside, been smart and having powerful resource we can learn from cellphones to do many things as some teachers want us to use our cellphones for Wikipedia, kahhot , dictionary web, and googlecassroom for reading , writing or gave us homework throw it.

As we can know already cellphone is very useful for this options too. In another reason, I daily uses my phone because it is easy to carrying It in the hallway instead of a big dictionary, and some dictionary does not contain the word that you looking for . And is a small size it is easy to carry, And is an important device to carry everywhere. For instance, cellphones or another type of device.

And it can drive you to many type of option which is very good! if you are not clear in the first option you can jump to the second option or third option if needed.

Some students came to the United State without speaking English which mean is so bad, and they don't know how to communicate with teachers so they are likely to uses their cellphone for translating words. calling ,sending message, receiving message , set remainder, multiple resource, ects.

Despite of each year is advancing many students at the among of age 12 or 15 years old have a phone or a tablet device which is fine to have. Then, If needed teachers can work in an online website to gave them homework to do at home or working in classroom. I am agree with students to use their cell phone in the classroom because some students came to the United State with not knowing any words in English, and even of a student that born in the United State or their native language is English can get to forget the meaning of a word in English. I use Google a lot of time because has everything that the dictionary can not be included for example, Google translate can tell you the pronunciation, quickly to research, and even if it is bad it will tell you the meaning besides that if you don't know how to spell the word it contains an option where you can talk to the cellphone which is a lovely option to use.

However, cellphones is a almighty thing to be used in the classroom to help students knowledge or everywhere. I was one of the student that came to United State without speaking any English, and teachers can't speak Spanish too, so I was able to use my phone for translate words to my language, it was helping a lot to communicate with other students that only speaks English. And also, it can have a different variety of information and some teachers will ask for it during the class, if you have one . And some point, approximate all people have their cellphones in their bag, and easy to care and some people have said that the cellphones is like their friend.

finally, which I did understand that cellphones is necessary needed to use in the classroom which is helping to translate word in another language and cellphones can give you many certain information, idea how to be specific in the word that you are looking for. Beyond of that, in the cellphone you just need to download the dictionary app or go the Google web and type easily the word that you need to fine information for.

Therefore, cellphones can give many way to you how to understand the word specially the Google web site it can give you pictures, or it can led you to a video link where you can see resources that are explaining the meaning of the word or different manner that they can be clear at the point.

"And,their wouldn't be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they won't be late. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time.     . Think about it. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home.

Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home.

After school many students might have something to do or attend. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine.

They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away.

In conclusion The school board shouldn't add an extra hour and a half to each school",0
"    . after 5 months of going to therapy,i was able to talk him to close a chapter because i learn to forgive but in my heart i felt hate for him what i told him was ""i love you but i love other person more than you and that person i'ts me"" yes, he cried but he did not deserved me .Finally i let toxic people leave my life,i'm not going to lie like i'm afraid to talk a guy again because i feel they will hurt me. One thing you don't ever forget is to be honest,and to be real with yourself and everyone around you.

Girls,if you reading this please don't make the same mistakes that i did in my past be always honest with your partnership or whoever, because the consequences are not how you might think. One day i told him that i want him to be honest with me,he always said that he was honest with me,2 week pass by he were keeping playing his little games and i did not say anything i just leave his message in delivered,1 years pass by he texted me saying that he felt so bad for everything he did to me in the past,i just told him everything that i felt for him in the past but he was not honest with me. Yes, they might be real and make you feel butterfly 5 months or 6,but things changes in this life person change not everything is always the same,anyways he started to lie to me when i knew that truth of that problems is when he start to hurt me all the time but when you love someone you let them hurt you,so i keep letting him hurt me,i started crying and to supplicated to stop hurting me he stop like any relationship we were okay for a week and then he started doing things that hurt,he started talking to girls,and cheated on me but us girls we so dumb that we keep them.2 Years after i was in depression i did not tell my parents they found out when they take me to the hospital because i passed out in my room crying, without eating for days i was in the hospital for a week after that i was able to go they take me to therapy. i'm not thinking to go out with a guy because girls you have to love yourself to be able to love other person.

In conclusion,if you are honest with yourself your life will be okay without any problem. When i was in 8th grade i met this person i was so in love with him,he add me on snapchat so that same day that he add me i post a pictures that i was in the field,35 minutes after he text me i was so happy,and nervous because i liked him so we start texting but we never talked in person,a week pass by and he start to being disrespectful with me,playing with my feelings i knew that we were just friends in those time. Let's be honest if you're yourself and not faking who you are in this world you'll become a better person in this world. Girls,let me tell you my big mistake that i did,we talk about 5 months as a friend after we talk for 5 months he make me his girlfriend,at the time i was still feeling butterfly for him that first years is was perfect like any relationship,those 12 months i was so happy,i always told him that he was ''the love of my life'' and i just say it for everything we went trough since middle school also,because he was my first boyfriend and my parents were fine that i was dating him because they though he was a good person.

Girls,find a guy who is real with you all the time they might be a lot of guys out there that can pretend that he is in love with you",0

"I think that if you really want to know about life's important value you need to either ask a guidance from expert that know all of the information about life's important matters or if you know the right information you will be fine but its also a great idea to check with experts to make sure that the information you know it's correct or to learn more about it.

In Life you will not know some things thats why another great idea is that you seek guidance expert that knows about life's important matter. You can always learn new things if you ask for help and you can learn more about life's important matter.

If you know your facts that can also be helpful and you dont need to go seek guidance expert about it.. Most time time people can be positive that they know about life's important matter and they dont need to seek help and that completely normal .

A personal story that i want to share is that most time i may think that i know everything about life's important matters.

If i sometimes dont go anywhere to seek guidance from expert because Im positive of the things i know, but also they are times where i do need to seek guidance experts about life's important matter and in my personal opinion that helps too when i need the help.

Seeking guidance from expert can help anyone know more about useful information about Life's important matter and much more information. I believe people who value Self-reliance should make their own decision, because they know what decision they want to make, but

Sometimes you need to seek guidance from experts opinions about life's important matter, because not everything you think its right its going to be right.

Its also not a bad thing if you chose your own idea or if you seek guidance for the information, if you do both either one is right in my opinion. While if you dont seek guidance you won't be able to learn anything about life's important matter.

When you know some information is also good to check with an expert who knows and can give you more information on the topic life's important matter its useful to know information to for the nearest future and also you can teach others who need the information.

Making a decision is not a bad idea neither is seeking for guidance from expert about life's important matters",0
"I'm really interested in this oportunity because I want to learn more about marketing, which is the business of promoting sales of a product, as by advertising and packaging, also learn about inform new innovations and persuade the people; I'm really creative, I enjoy making posters, using social media, talking with people, and I can speak spanish, english, and a little of french, also I want to have organization and administration of the things, however, I'm interested in pursuing that type of employment, that the manager of a business can tell us his experience, to motivate us because if you want something you will never give up, I will always put all my effort to be a better person.

In conclusion, I hope I can have this opportunity, to make sure if marketing is the job I want for the rest of my life because it's really important to choose the correct job, the people need to have passion for the things that they do , so they can enjoy and be happy everyday, and I want to transmit that feeling for everyone.. In the actuality, many schools have been a good support for all the students that want to continue studying, and have goals for their life, the schools provide opportunities and have partnerships with companies that allow students explore certain occupations.

It's hard for many students to choose the career they want to study, some students leave school after high school, so they loses great opportunities that the school provides, but my dream is to have passion for a job, so I want this opportunity to make a good decision whether if I want to study marketing, through internships and shadowing opportunities that the school provide",0

In today's increasingly competitive job market, it is important for students to commit to a career path at a young age. By starting to research and think about a career path early on in life, students can save themselves money and time in the long run. Even if the odds may be stacked against them, students should find the courage to follow their passions and use the resources available to them to turn their dreams into reality.. It is important for students to remember that their career path should not be dictated by anyone else, and that personal ambition is a virtue. 

However, sometimes family, external pressures, or even fear of failure can impede a student from pursuing their dreams. Furthermore, commitment to a career can help create a sense of independence, allowing students to make crucial decisions for their own future. One way to do this is to take advantage of the resources offered by schools, like the help of teachers and access to career counselors",1
"Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. It opens more doors for them, and helps them know that they do matter and they should talk to people they can trust. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often.

Now why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why it's importent. Again by attention I don't mean something as so they can get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kids and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. It helps people to know they matter and there is a sloution to their problems no matter what they are going through. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person.

This might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they don't want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they don't want people to know. Now by attention I don't mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

What I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention.        . Something that parents need to keep in mind is that when your kid asks for advice don't think they are crazy or they just want attention because that is not the point, they just want help with what they are going through. There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they don't need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems.

In 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. Why does most people want multiple advice when they are seeking for advice? As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice",0
"At least some of the factors contributing to his successful outcome included his creative spirit, unwavering ambition, and willingness to take risks, traits made all the more evident following his initial failure. His experience proved that failure can be a form of learning – an opportunity to experiment and acquire knowledge that wouldn’t have been gained otherwise. 

Behind successful individuals are often stories of failure, as was the case with Steve Jobs. 

Many people have found success despite failure – oftentimes even because of it. Throughout his tenure at Apple, Jobs continued to hold exceedingly high standards for products and maintained a shrewd control over the company’s image.

It is important and satisfying to experience success following failure because it signals progress and achievement. Steve Jobs was able to navigate the difficult waters of entrepreneurism, becoming not only one of the most respected and well-known business leaders of his time, but also an icon of success and perseverance in the face of failure.. Though failure can be a tough pill to swallow, it has proven to have positive implications. Take the case of Steve Jobs, for example. Power, freedom, and respect, are often linked to success and are rewarding in that they grant a sense of control in the individual’s future. After he was removed from his role as CEO of Apple in 1985, Jobs founded Next, Inc., a computer start-up, and ultimately sold it to Apple at a large profit. This led to his return to Apple where, ironically, he proved even more successful, engineering extraordinary growth in Apple’s stock value",1
"I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. So that's why First impressions are almost impossible to change.. Many people think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. Even the animals have first impressions, because when you are trying to buy a dog, the dog is going to have a first impression because the dog is getting an owner. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other.

In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. That is an example of first impressions.

I think that if you're trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you can't change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions is something that every human has in their lives and they can't change it, because is a part of their lives",0
"They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. It's fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. You never know truly about something until you experiment it.

In conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain can't erase.

Accordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are. With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesn't want to be at the function. For example, calling a job for a interview is something you'd want to change your normal character into a more formal and nice responsible person. While getting to know them that same thought changes about them because now you truly know who they are. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits. On the other hand, there's always an ""i wonder"" question in my mind about everyone, because it's totally normal. First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. The first times will always be different than the regular times. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you.

For instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their ""first impression"". When meeting someone new there is many of ways people act towards you.             ",0

As the global warming crisis deepens and our environment suffers, it has brought into question how our current behavior has added to the problem and posed the question of how to make a positive difference. By making small changes in our own lives, it can reinforce the importance of being conscious of the planet and create hope for stakeholders and decision makers to take action.. This can come in the form of reducing our dependence on technology, limiting our energy usage flat rate, and employing renewable energies to be in tune with the environment. While it is difficult to make large-scale changes, we can effect small scale self-change which can eventually have larger impacts on the environment. We can look to our daily lives and identify small changes in behavior that can reduce our energy use and our reliance on electricity",1
"Believe or not, but they gave everything they had to be there. A positive attitude is really important when you are trying to be successful, is sometimes what motivates you to keep going and achieve your goals.

However, just having a positive attitude is not going to make you a successful person. Some people say that having a positive attitude is one of the keys to success in life. To reach the success in life you need to be proactive, you need to believe in yourself, work as hard as you can, and do what you love because your soul and hearth is what guide you during your life.

When you look at the big Hollywood stars, or the players in the NFL, you can see that they successes in life, making millions of dollars and doing what they love. Everyone around the world is trying to be successful in life, people fight for that everyday. It was a mix of positive attitude, hard work, and talent.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is the key success in life, but only who's really trying and giving their hearth into this, will be successful.",0

Here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hires coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. and to get their mind working antler and help them to have a good mind and learn how to grow better and teach you guys to learn and thaknyou for grading my essay I love you from heart and have a nice day. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""I disagree with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because if you have already try to do something more than you have already mastered,

You will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples Companies,Schools and Sports etc. At the end of the day the light away the light. Here are some examples when people play video games like fortnite people be watching streamers from YouTube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they going to play at any bad or good situation

Here are some example like Apple is big company and Samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like Apple always make a good phone which is always better than Samsung but Samsung try their best to make a better phone than Apple so, Samsung has been trying to make better phones then Apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, The GB, and motherboards. I think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you more better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them they will beat the master because they already know whats the master is going to do and they will try to protect themselves. they need to go to gym and stuff to know hat kind of abilities they better in a moth year or days",0
"I'm not saying it's impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it it's likely students won't get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students can't graduate from high school.

To rap this up I say that the main reason why I don't think it a smart idea for the school board to ad a extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep they're getting and If kids come to school the next day,they won't get the information they need for their classes because they're tired.

Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in won't be there fault for their sleep management. No,I don't think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why they're not getting enough sleep. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework.

You can't even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. I hope the school boards read this and take time to considerate this idea that would just give another reason for students to fail in the future.",0
"Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch.

Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that it's disgusting. In my opinion. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she did'nt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I would'nt eat. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I would'nt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that would'nt eat in school.

I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren don't eat at school. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. When I was younger I would'nt eat at school and until this day I don't because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coud'nt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve.

In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids don't eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school.

When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woud'nt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch.

"In both cases, providing examples can lead to greater understanding of an issue and provide individuals with evidence of how things can be improved.. Examples can also serve to show the intended impacts of an action and help to foster an understanding of how a concept can work in the real world.

For example, if we are trying to convince people about the value of investing in renewable energy sources, an example of how other cities have made the switch to renewable sources and seen impressive cost savings can help make the case. Examples can demonstrate to people why an idea is important and provide them with a tangible solution to a particular problem. Alternatively, if we are trying to make a case for social justice reforms, presenting examples of successful reform initiatives in other countries can make a strong argument for why those reforms should be put in place. 
One of the most powerful tools for influencing others is providing examples that will help illustrate a point and aid in convincing them of an argument",1
"When it comes to making life decisions, imagination can offer us a brilliant new angle: Escapism, exploration and creativity. It can help us visualize our end goals and the journey to get there before we take our first steps. Finally, imagination can help us cope with the pressures of college life. It gives us an avenue for problem solving and helps us to think outside the box. In many ways, imagination can spark our minds to discover solutions never before considered. A thoughtful blend of imagination and knowledge can help us make the best choices for our lives, often without resorting to the stress that knowledge alone can create.

Imagination offers an alternative view of the world around us and allows us to see the potentials available to us, even before we make a decision. 
Imagination brings an invaluable perspective to the decision-making process. 

Furthermore, imagination can help us in college. Additionally, imagination grants us access to ideas and perspectives that knowledge alone may not. It gives us the ability to take a step back and evaluate our choices without being limited by knowledge.",1
"But as he got older he realized no one though he was serious and rejected him. Has there been anyone in your life that shared any wisdom or experience with you? If not, why not ask someone that is important to you? They would love to share maybe a dad, mom ,grandparents they have tones of experience in the past. They thought he was trouble child, Soon when I was born ,and when i was able to talk and walk my. This shows that my father really cares about my future and want me to do well in life and showed me some wisdom in of how hard like will be if i don't do well in school. As well as listening to the adults, bow when entering a door and greeting them. My dad has to count the money that he was getting and how much to give back the workers. A person who has shared wisdom or experience with me would be my father ,because he has showed me how to be respectful to adults and show me how to work some business papers.

One thing that my father had shared with me is how to respect adults. This shows that my father gave me some experience to get respected into the family.

Another thing that my father has shared with me is how to work at a business. H+e had showed me by telling about his past and show how to mange a business when I am older. For instance for the past few months my father has showed me how to do paper work at his second job. He would do bad choices like going out with his friends all the time and not listen to this parents. My father did not want me to me like him when he was younger so he made sure I was respectful to my grandparents. So what are some people that is important to you that has shared wisdom and experince? Or what experince and wisdom would you share to people other people?                                                                    . For example, my father wasn't always the best child. In closing my father taught me how to do business and how to process one because I want to do business.

In conclusion a person who has showed me wisdom and experience would be my father by teaching me to respect adult and how to do paper work at his job. Those days he showed me showed me how much money everything is ,and made me realized that I need to work very hard because if I want a simple job that I doesn't do much that gave a job that can pay my bills I need to work hard in school. So a few times my dad would come into my room and teach me how to split the money they were making and pay the bills. My father would make me say please and thank you",0
"I will also make a plan to track my progress throughout the semester, which will help me to identify any areas I need to focus on more in order to improve my grades. 
I will begin by creating a comprehensive study schedule that will span across the entire semester. During my assigned study time, I will focus on actively engaging with the material and studying the content that is covered on any upcoming tests, in addition to the assigned reading. This will include blocks of time dedicated to studying each subject, as well as breaks to allow for mental and physical rest. As I receive feedback from tests and other assignments, I will make adjustments to my study plan as needed in order to ensure success in my classes.",1
"I think college do not have a specific age, just with your goals to make everything without leave school is strong enough to make a year early.

Those plans do not make problem, if just a way to finish what you want many people admire those people and see their potential. Many reasons that take people to get these program, if because they usually do not have enough money, have to work, and need to study at the same time, everyone do not have the same opportunity opt for study during summer or online classes.

If you analyze students work after school, they want to get a diploma and make a force one year, when they make get one year less that say you are study and passed your classes different can be when teachers give you a year when you don't know nothing and teachers approve your year that's different go college when you have no idea how react to many classes than you never see or never show during the period of high school, the students that study during summers or in the evenings are focus in their classes that's because they finish fast and go college to involve in a new goal.

Example if you go school and need to work you'll to opt for study in summer or in the evenings that's your best option, students follow to take courses because it's a better idea maybe do not be the same learning, but with effort you can advance. Most students who want to graduate before the years, that they should be take. These program is good to make steps in life. Students who have a lot responsibilities and their want a diploma. Most students who take this decision if because they have to work and can spend much time, and they sacrifice some summers or evenings to get close their goals and each one do what is more beneficiary for their way. Is not important how many years do you spend in high school, the think is what is your percent of each class. If you see, passed, and remember high school lesson you will be fine, if you study and make your task these option will be good. Students with the capacity of make their mind strongest, go to their limits, and make one year early. when a student have a early year because want a start to make a goals. how you can involve in college: studying, focus, and remember what you see or learn.

In conclusion each student have different way to think how want to study and how many time want to spend in high school. For me, if a good option opt for finish fast school and start a new stage in our life.. Schools that allow students make more short their school years, if better for most of students who want get their diplomas, enter college, and start a career",0

""Commit a career at a young age gives time for students to approach their goals and advance towards the future""

During High School, many Juniors and Seniors are already preparing themselves for college, taking classes that would give them credit and would benefit them as they go, also there are some classes that would provide students lots of experiences, these experiences prepared students in a way for them to see how much effort they must put to approach their goal.

The Board of Teachers in a private school have said that, ""The more early a student starts their way to a career, the less struggle is for them to accomplish it"", because at their young age they have more time, less worries and not that much of responsibility, as a person gets older the more problems and responsibilities come to them, Although students also have many struggles in school, their house etc, is more less then an adult, That is why teachers think that is better for a student to commit a career at a young age because they are less worried.

The percentage of students that commit a career at a young age is high, many of this students received a schoolarships others financial help, because of their behavior and their effort,The other half of this percentage of students have a well financial situation and there is no need for help or schoolarships, although there is a low percentage of students that prefer to work instead of going to college, because of their financial situation,However many students with low financial situation have succeed at their young age because of their effort to accomplish their dreams by working hard and knowing what they want to succeed in.

Commiting a career at a young age could be difficult or it could be simple, there is more students that had said that is a great idea, because your mind at a young age is envolving in everything that surrounds the student, such as important information that would benefit him, as i said, the brain has more potencial to store as much information as it can, because the student is young and is focus on its goals and there is no problems or thoughts that could disstract the student.

Other students had said that is a bad idea in a way of making the biggest decisition, which is choosing what career you want to accomplish, because at that age they do not actually know what they really want.

Parents and the societies have a big influence when students are choosing which path to go, some parents wants their kids to follow their steps, so they encorage their kids to take courses that would help them as they go, parents would always want the best for their kids more when its about their future.

Accomplishing a career at a young age brings many benefits, one of them is that the person not longer have to be thinking about it, takes a big weight off their shoulders, also the person would have more time for the family and especially the person would have many opportunities to find a job, because that person is young and lots of doors would be open for them.

As we see commiting a career at a young age has many advantanges the biggest one is that, the students approach their goals and advance towards their great future.",0
"For example, the older student can teach the concepts of algebra which the younger student is taking next year. The young student might even study algebra with the older student. This means that the younger student would already know the concepts of the three subjects that the older student taught him which is science, language arts, and math.

The older student can prepare the younger student for the future. Do you want your kid to be assisted by a older student? Well look no further, this program could make your child be more smarter, prepare the young student for whats coming in the future, and a older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework.

The older student that is assisting the younger student could make him smarter.                      . What i mean by this is that the older student will help the student on math, language arts, and science which the older student already took. The older kid already knows the concepts of the subjects that the younger student is taking, which means he will teach him the concepts. This program can make your child be more smarter, be prepared for whats coming in the future, and a older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework. The older student can teach other subjects like physical science, and civics economics which the young student could be ready for.

The final reason why this program is helpful is because the older student helps the younger student with his homework. The younger student might ask for help on his homework and the older student will help him. This is why the program is helpful. The older student can teach what he is learning to the younger student. If the student does not understand the question then the older student would teach him.

This program is actually pretty good for your child if he does not understand and need help on a subject that he has trouble on",0
"He was all the time take his own decisions. Also, it's not good for young people to make their own decisions. Seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters also really good decisions to make to be success.. Seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters can be really helpful and it can be the solution for all the problems.

Seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters will make you success in your life. Also, it can make your life easyer and better.

Seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters is really helpful for everyone. He had money problems and he didn't tell anyone about his problems. I went to him to ask for help and I told him about all the problems. He started to talk with me and gives me solutions.

Making your own decisions is really not good idea specialy for young people. Seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters much better because you can get many good ideas from people who had experiences before and know better than you.

Making your own decisions can make your life worst",0
"Through such benefits as saving time, having a more flexible schedule, and increasing access to classes, they are a great option for students who are looking to make the most of their learning experience. 

College-level courses are taking place online more and more, showing the potential of this type of learning. Additionally, since online classes don't require attending in person, students can save time by not having to get up and go to class on certain days. 
Online classes provide a unique set of advantages compared to traditional classroom learning. One major benefit of taking courses online is the extra time it gives students to finish their work. This can be especially helpful for working students, who may otherwise not have as much time to dedicate to learning. 

In summary, online classes offer a variety of benefits beyond traditional classroom learning. Online classes don't have fixed meeting times, so students can fit their studies in with their other commitments. Online classes for college credit often provide the same material that can be offered in traditional classrooms, but with a flexible schedule that fits more easily around the lives of the students who take them. With the increasing availability of online courses for college credit, there is much to be gained from taking classes using this mode of instruction.. Furthermore, students of online courses can also enjoy the comfort of sleeping in more often. In addition to allowing students to better manage their workload, taking online courses for college credit can also increase access to more classes, as universities have been able to continue their operations during the COVID-19 pandemic by switching to an online format",1

However, he wasn't sure which classes at his high school would be best for him to take in order to help him prepare for his career. 

The counselor told John that taking physics, calculus, computer programming, and engineering classes would be very helpful for him in his future endeavors. 
John had done lots of research into what career he wanted to pursue after high school, and felt confident that he wanted to become an engineer. To get some guidance, he decided to talk to one of his school's guidance counselors. With this information, John felt more informed and prepared to make the best educational decisions for himself.",1
"Because when you are youn men and you still know how that work you will cap doing that wey how you learn Like other family they dont that ,when they are eat they use table &phone that wey you will never grow,you get to old person and you will cap doing that same thing that you be doing when you where a kids and i thing you main dont grow..

"Studies have shown that we are more likely to reach goals and feel secure when we receive positive affirmations from those around us. 

To illustrate, an individual who may have previously felt lack of faith in their ability to complete a task, may receive praise from an adult for their progress thus far. Through providing these positive affirmations, adults have the privilege of creating an encouraging atmosphere, a sense of security, and a safe environment to learn and grow.. Trust in oneself and others can also help to build self-esteem, bolstering confidence and resilience. This well-intentioned encouragement can be a large motivator for the individual, as it helps make them feel capable and affirmed in their mission. 
 
Adults have an important opportunity to provide affirmation to younger individuals to support and build self-esteem. 
Self-esteem is the foundation for feelings of self-worth and courage, and can be cultivated from positive affirmations provided by others. It also shows that there are people around who believe in them and trust their potential",1
"Then this lady came and started talking with me, she asked me questions and suddently said good luck that made me so releived and I got this feeling that I was going to do good on the test. I have shared wisdom with my friends my favorite one was, believing in yourself is the key of life, that means believing in yourself is what is going to get you through life, tough times, and challenges.

You should never give up because if you do you will regret everything in the future. When someone gives you a chance to tell you wis things always accept and just listen because one day you may give it to someone else in the future and they will pass it on to other people.

Has anyone gave you widom? My grandpa did once, it was the best thing I ever heard and I still remeber the day he told me, it was the day before he died I have a feeling he knew that he was going to die the day after. Wisdom is the most important thing to everyone. Last year I was walking to school, I was very scared and worried because I had a unit test. My grandpa was a very wis man, he loved sharing wisdom with anyone that was having a bad day. Well how can you change someones day by just telling a wis thing, has anyone told you anything that change your life and why you should never give up.

You can change someones day by just saying good luck. Giving up is not going to make you successful in anyway in life. . If you are going to give up, there are a lot of people that are going to try helping in life so take the chances they give and believe in yourself.

Wis people can change the world. Wis people are the ones that can change the world, make an impact on someones life and are the believers. My grandpa was a very caring and nice man he loved everyone. Has anyone ever shared wisdom with you? well my grandpa did before he passed away, three years ago my grandpa died because of cancer he struggled and was fighting through but still never gave up. Wisdom can change a way of how your feeling and the ways you can change the world anyday or anytime. Sharing wisdom is not bad it is a very important thing to other people because my grandpa said ""giving up is just for lazy people that don't care about life, so fight through until your successful"" from that day I always try my hardest so if he is watching me he knows that he impacted me in so many ways. Giving out wisdom to anyone is the best feeling and you should never stop giving it out even if its the only wis things you know. Wis people can change your day around in many ways. Giving up is when you never got to hear a word about believing in yourself or you have never accepted a wis word from anyone. Wis people can impact your life. You can change someones day without you knowing that you were acually wis and helped change their day. My grandpa once said to me "" giving up is just for lazy people that don't care about life, so fight through until your successful"". Everyday I remeber going to the hospital any wonder why did he have to die and leave me. My parents always told me to never give up because giving up means you want to shut anything in your brain and not do anything about it. People can just say anything to bring you down but fighting through is the oppisite of giving up",0
"Although those are beneficial perks, it causes people to be too dependent on technology. In addition to that, people use technology to educate themselves. For example, people's vision might get blurry and people that are looking down at their electronic devices impacts their neck position. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it impacts their health in a negative way and people get too dependent on technology.

Health is very important, but people take good health for granted; To begin with, technology may impact individuals health in a negative way. This is important because instead of people completing tasks with technology, they can easily do it themselves. People may think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives, but that is false. Technology is taking over the world! There is now less human contact. This is important because people need to be more aware of what can effect their health in a horrible way.

The use of technology is phenomenal, people use it in their every day lives. Furthermore, people may slouch down when they are using a computer. In conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it can possibly impact their health in a horrible way and people get too dependent on technology, but they use it to help themselves.. To illustrate, if people want a snack they can walk down to the store and buy it instead of ordering it online

People think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives since people with no available transportation can order online or if others live in a area that is dangerous, they can order online to receive the things that they want to be safe; However, technology has a negative impact since it makes people risk their health.

"Finally, we can focus on the resilience we attain through our failures. Taking risks and being bold enough to learn from our mistakes is how we grow and become smarter.. We can also view failure as a challenge – take it as an opportunity to apply what we have learnt from it and take the necessary steps to break through the wall of adversity. For example, Steve Jobs is famously quoted as saying “I’m convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.”. 
Failure is an important part of the pursuit of success. 

It is important to stay enthusiastic when facing failure in pursuit of success. We can use failure as an incentive to keep pushing for success, rather than giving up. He made many wrong decisions during his career, but each time he used his failure to gain insight and learn from his mistakes. Indeed, some of the most successful people in the world have used failure as a means of learning, growing, and eventually achieving success",1
"While it is sometimes necessary to be truthful, it can be difficult to phrase things in a way that's gentle and kind. With practice and patience, honesty can lead to mutual understanding and respect.. However, it can be difficult to know how to use honesty in a way that does not hurt someone's feelings. When people are open and honest with one another from the start, they often form much stronger connections and a greater level of trust. Additionally, honest conversations can help clear up any misunderstandings or disagreements.

It is important to remember that being honest does not mean being blunt or unkind. While it is necessary to be honest and straightforward, it must be done in a way that benefits both parties emotionally and physically. 
Honesty is an important part of maintaining healthy relationships and building trust. Learning how to be honest while also being mindful of others’ feelings is an important skill that must be practiced in order to be successful. Being honest can be especially helpful during difficult conversations, as it can prevent potential hurt feelings or misunderstanding.

The conclusion that can be drawn from being honest is that it can help create new friendships and maintain healthy relationships. This is why learning how to be both honest and compassionate is essential.

Honesty can help create new friendships by setting a foundation of mutual respect",1
"Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. It's just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesn't mean that they don't like me.                . Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. He told me that he didn't like me that much so we didn't talk too much. So go and look for that its's not difficult to have that. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked.

I don't get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. If you only have personality that good or have charisma that even greater to have, sighing out. He didn't even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. The first impressions are almost impossible to change. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I don't have issues with no one around me. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. I disagree about that, cause me personal i don't have issues with no one around me. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didn't like me because I was dating someone he liked that's what happen.

My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasn't I could of make-up something to be good with them. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good",0
"But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work",0

"I agree about that some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, the students can would benefit. One of the reasons are that I think this can be a more easy way for students to learn is because they cannot be distract to anothers students, so they can work with tranquility. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.

Another example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you don't finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time.

In conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits. Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they don't need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school.

For example, if you work at home, you don't need permission to use the bathroom, because you're at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. That's what I think that working online or video conferencing is a more easy way to lear for the students, and also I think is a big opportunity too.",0
"When we have the freedom and autonomy to make decisions, we gain a sense of self-ownership and control over our destiny. This is one of the most important decisions we make in life, and one that many of us delegate to others. 

In addition, the importance of being able to make our own decisions can be seen in our capacity to recognize the good and the bad in life. Making our own decisions on relocation opens up a world of possibilities, allowing us to explore new experiences and discover what brings us true happiness and success. 

Take marriage as an example. 

Overall, making your own decisions is a fundamental aspect of an enriching and fulfilling life, and when we take control of our destiny, we can shape our lives to our satisfaction.. In addition, we can evaluate the pros and cons of the relationship and consider our own needs and goals.

Relocation is another key decision that should be made of your own accord. While it is often a common expectation to follow in the footsteps of someone else, such as our parents, it is important to recognize that our lives are our own and that if we want to pursue something different, then we should be allowed to do so. This customizing of our mental framework leads to greater self-awareness and enables us to make informed decisions. While most of us are predisposed to stick with the status quo, including ideas and beliefs that have been passed down to us from previous generations, it is only when we make our own decisions that we are able to critically evaluate any potential risks or rewards associated with our decisions. 
Making your own decisions is essential for a healthy and prosperous life. When we make our own decisions about who we marry, or even if we don’t marry, we can ensure that the individual we select is a genuine partner, on whom we can depend. By having the ability to choose our own path, we can be empowered to seek out the best opportunities available to us and create a future that is full of possibility",1
"when you're in school you don't get a lot of time to spend with your family. so that i can relax, go out with my family and friends, and do a lot off crazy things.

In summer we go to different places with my family, we like to travel, we go to crazy water parks, museums, and we go to the zoo sometimes. because you get busy doing your homework and studying.

Summer is the best part of the seasons. students enjoy summer like everyone else. in my opinion, i'm a student and i would love that my school give us a 3-4 weeks off summer break, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.                                   . Yes, it would be nice for students to have a 3-4 of break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. in summer is always sunny outside, you can go to the beach, play soccer with your friends and brothers, you can do skateboarding .you can do a lot of things in summer.

In summer you can got to different places with your family. you can travel, visit a lot of places you don,t know and want to go there or you can just relax at your house watching movies, series or shows that you like to watch.

In conclusion i think having breaks is a good idea because you can relax, go out and spend time with your family and friends, and do a lot crazy things",0
" For these reasons, group work should be considered as a preferable method of working.. 
Working in groups has a range of benefits compared to working alone. This makes it easier to come up with creative solutions to problems. Furthermore, group work can foster strong teamwork skills, communication, and problem solving skills - all of which are necessary out in the real world. 

Communication is an important factor in group work. Furthermore, I was able to use group based activities to develop proficiency in problem solving and negotiation, essential skills in the real world. Collaborative efforts have the advantage of combining a variety of perspectives; when it comes to tackling an issue, two or more people working together can provide different perspectives than a single individual. Having a common goal and communicating it through all group members ensures that everyone is on the same page, reducing conflict and misinterpretation. It is an efficient way of working and allows people to benefit from different perspectives. Additionally, groups can provide helpful and constructive feedback to its members, which can help refine ideas and identify potential weaknesses. Additionally, group work has the potential to be more efficient than individual work, as dividing the workload amongst members can speed up the process. Group work has enabled me to learn from the collective knowledge of my peers, and allowed me to develop my capacity for collaboration and communication. It is also essential to respect each other's opinions and points of view in order to create an effective atmosphere towards achieving the goal. 

Ultimately, working in groups has many advantages compared to working alone. 

From my own experience, working in groups can be incredibly advantageous",1
"Taking a break from the hustle and bustle of our busy lives can allow us to unwind, take stock of what's important, cultivate creativity, and more. 

It is important to not fall into the trap of a lazy routine; doing something productive every now and then can be incredibly beneficial. This inactivity can produce a welcome relief that can give us the mental break needed to come back feeling relaxed and ready to grab the reins of life again. In doing so, we can enjoy a balanced lifestyle, and find a healthy equilibrium between our activities and inactivity.. 
We all have our own philosophies on life, and how we should live it. However, it is also important to recognize that doing nothing can provide the same benefits. 

It is clear that both doing something and nothing have their own important merits. Taking time to work on our passions, helping out a friend, investing in our own learning - these are all examples of meaningful and useful activities that can help us develop. Doing something productive all the time can lead to overwhelming stress and exhaustion that can set us back further as opposed to moving us forward. Thomas Jefferson seemed to suggest that being idle was not ideal, famously saying, “Determine never to be idle.” While this can be excellent advice, it is also important to balance it by embracing the value of doing nothing once in a while. While Jefferson's advice to “determine never to be idle” can be sound, it is essential that we remember to factor in the importance of taking a break, in both an active and inactive form",1
"Distorted guitars are often used in progressive and heavy metal music for a heavier sound, with electric guitar solos often using this type of guitar. 

In conclusion, each of these three instruments has its own set of sounds and styles that make it distinct. It's also important to note that not everyone learns at the same rate. With the right practice and dedication, any musician can master all of these instruments and use them to create their own unique music.. With a piano, you can play a broad range of music, including classical, jazz, pop, rock, blues, and more. As for saxophones, their sound can be heard in all sorts of genres, including jazz, blues, rock, funk, Latin, reggae, and more. Someone who practices regularly can learn to play each instrument quite quickly, while others might take longer. 
Pianos and saxophones are two of the most widely-used instruments in the world of music. 

Guitars come in several varieties, most notably acoustic, distorted, and clean. Lastly, clean guitars are favored by jazz, folk, and country musicians for their full, natural sound.

The amount of time it takes to learn an instrument will depend on the individual's level of commitment and dedication. An acoustic guitar has a signature warm and mellow sound, and is best-suited for acoustic and folk music",1
"I think that schools must have a after school homework club because students who are having difficulty in school can get extra help from teachers, students could improve their grades, and teachers and students can work together to fulfill the students needs.

The first reason I think that schools must have an after school homework club is because students who are having difficulty in class can get extra help form their teachers and students.

One time

I had trouble understanding how to answer the questions my teacher gave to me about the civil war 2 years ago, and my teacher said that I could stay after school in the homework club and to meet her their.

That was the reason how I understood how to answer the questions on the quiz.

That is one reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

The second reason why I think that schools must have a after school homework club is so students could improve their grades in their classes.

One time I had a D in my science class because I needed more help with remembering the parts of a cell.

My science teacher then told me that I could stay after school and go to the homework club with her to practice on the parts of a cell.

One week later my grade went up to a B because my teacher helped me pass my test.

This is the second reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

The third reason why I think that schools should have a after school homework club is so teachers and students can work together to fulfill the students needs.

One time I stayed after school for the homework club and a teacher was having a heard time explaining a question to a student who spoke Spanish.

The teacher asked me if I could translate what she is saying to the student.

the teacher and I both helped the student understand the question.

This is the third reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

In conclusion, these are the three reasons why I think that schools must have a after school homework club.",0
"I'm not against having the after school homework club. Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult and sometimes I need help doing my homework and it would help me have in my school a after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students.. I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and i would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school or they don't remember they have homework",0
"I am not agree because everybody in this world can be freedom to think or to do whetever they wan because we have the independence of right. You will have a good future don't be afriad don't loss your enthusiasm. Our environment it will be consider many perspectives, and how we can work to balance our mind, health and see many solutions in our life. we have to develop many ways to solve the problems. Now i see and i can be better.

You can see now that you can do it. When you wish something like be profetional, soccer player, but if you play with failure you can fail thats right you can not have to play wiht that.

Also there is going to be peoples in your way that they dosen't want that you can be happy, like a fake friends, and sometimes we were really surprised because someones in your family are fake too, but don't pay atention to them just focus in your dreams and finish.

Another example is my self because when i came in United States, i don't even know English and i thoght that will be more difficul for me, i thoght that i will fail every class, but is not how was i thihk because i just focus in my class and i work hard every single day, and i never fail one class that's right you never have to loss the enthusiasm in your life and enjoy every single day, because the life is just one and we has to make the most of opportunitys in this life, and be happy every single day.

When i came in United States without my parents i thoght that will be more difficul for me, at the beginnig was so hard because i always live with them but i never give up because i know that they want a good future for me and i saw that way and now i juts want to help them because they are a good example in my life they say to me, son just fight for your dreams and don't worry about us you know that will be ok and that's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i want to reversed the help that they give me one day.

My father and my mother say, you arer the reason for work and fight so hard for you. They can enthusiasm for things or wons that they did.

If they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that it's. That if they don't want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me.

you never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and don't be failure and don't play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.

I will give you one example for this thing, you see the poor people that they follow the rules just for money or do whetever things just for money is because they just wanna a good future for they kid's and they don't wanna failure they just fight for they kid's to have a good education and they hope that one they they can be somebody profetional like doctor and help them family to get out the situation of poor.

I hope that everyone in this world can see the right things and complete and don't be afraid if you don't do nothing bad why you suppost to be afraid you have your right laws. That's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i take the example that they give me because i wanna be a good example for my childrens and be like my parents or better.

When you have a problems to solve and you feel that you can fail just think creatively about different ways to solve and actively work to balance your mind, health and emotions or enthusiasm. If you play wiht that thing you can fail in your life, but you can learn that way because when you broken down and you say i can't continue with this, is when you have to say i am stronger, the life give a leason, and i learn about that.

"They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation.

I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit.. DISTANCE LEARNING

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

Distance learning has many advantages for students, as it allows them to save time and money by eliminating the need to attend physical classes. For those juggling work and family commitments, distance learning offers flexible course schedules that allow them to attend classes as their schedules allow.  All of these opportunities can help the student to expand their professional and personal networks.. In addition, a wider range of courses and materials can be accessed through online learning compared to a typical classroom setting.

However, there are some disadvantages to distance learning. Students must have reliable access to the internet and be proficient with technology to be successful. Furthermore, online learners may miss out on the social aspect of physical classes and the networking opportunities that come with learning alongside others.  

For instance, a student enrolled in an online degree program may have difficulty forming relationships with professors, which can make it difficult to land internships or full-time job opportunities. Additionally, there is less direct contact between instructors and students, so it can be difficult to get feedback promptly. On the other hand, an on-campus student may be able to develop more meaningful connections with faculty, attend networking events, and participate in extracurricular activities",1
"

It can be argued that people can still grow and develop without trying something new. Pushing boundaries and attempting something new can often lead to phenomenal results, both personally and professionally.. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson is well known for his musing that ""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" To him, it meant that life should be an ever-evolving journey of discovery rather than settling for what one already knows. In addition to this, people may develop transferable skills that can be applied to a variety of contexts. 

Despite this, attempting something beyond what one has already mastered can be incredibly rewarding. Finally, mastering something new may give a person the inspiration and confidence to attempt further feats.

Overall, Emerson's idea of venturing beyond one's comfort zone holds considerable merit. Taking time to reflect on the lessons already learned can lead to personal growth that foundations have been laid for. Although this message may be motivating, there are a few who disagree with Emerson's viewpoint. By pushing beyond preconceived boundaries, people can open themselves up to fresh creative ideas and make incredible breakthroughs. A person can also develop new skills within an already familiar subject, such as furthering the understanding of mathematics. Many people take this statement as an invitation to push past their comfort zone and take a step into the unknown",1
"With ample preparation, support, and alternative options, students can still achieve their post-secondary dreams.. Not participating in typically senior years activities such as prom, senior trips, or senior lock-ins can be disappointing for these students. Additionally, for students who are looking for more immediate relief, there are alternative options available, such as taking college classes while still in high school or taking a gap year between high school and college. 

Overall, it is important for students graduating high school in a condensed timeframe to be aware of the potential issues they could face, but also possible solutions. 
As the challenges of graduating high school in three years become more established, we need to be aware of the potential issues and how we can best address them. Being in advanced classes also put pressure on students to keep up with their studies and peers at a more accelerated pace.

In order to battle these issues, it is important for students to be well prepared for college. They should actively participate in extracurricular activities, and take advantage of on-campus support services such as mental health counselors, academic advisors, and mentors. For those experiencing financial difficulty, seeking financial aid or applying for grants and scholarships is a great way to help cover college expenses. Many students who finish high school in a condensed timeframe may struggle with the adjustment to college life",1
"Even when goals are not met, enthusiasm and persistence can keep us motivated and encourage us to keep trying. 
Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it can be an integral component of success. Every mistake or setback is an opportunity to learn and grow, and through the process of trial and error, we can build the necessary skills and resources needed for success. The role of enthusiasm and effort is paramount when it comes to achieving success. By continuing to strive for our goals, we are able to gain the experience, confidence, and resilience needed to persevere through the difficulties associated with failure.

Ultimately, the journey to success is one of continual growth, learning, and self-discovery; and sometimes our biggest successes come from moments of failure. With enthusiasm and effort as two of our closest companions, we can turn failure into the stepping stone to success.. It is important to remember that focusing on what we can do with failure – learning from our mistakes and bouncing back with newfound resilience – is the key to unlocking greater successes in life",1
"On one hand, many argue that students should be familiar with their career trajectory from a young age, in order to focus energy and resources on necessary skills and experiences. Additionally, the quickly evolving job market can make it difficult for students to decide on a particular career path that best suits their interests and abilities, that will still be in existence in the years to come. 

In conclusion, the decision to commit to a career at a young age should be based on a full understanding of the pros and cons. While focusing on a clear career goal from an early age can enable students to maximize their potential, the potential limitations of making such a decision too soon should be taken into account. An early career goal allows students to allocate their energies into relevant learning, rather than trying to tackle a broad range of subjects in an effort to slowly discover their ideal career.  

One of the main arguments in favour of an early career commitment is that it allows students to maximize their potential by focusing their education on specific skills. On the other hand, proponents of delayed commitment argue that it can be limiting to make a single decision at a young age, without taking into account how life and experiences may influence career direction. They may find that life experiences, or gaining more knowledge of the broader career paths have a significant influence on their ultimate career decision. 
The debate of whether students should commit to a career path at an early age is one that causes fierce contention among parents and educators alike. Ultimately, only by considering the impact of an early career commitment can students be enabled to make a decision regarding a career path that best suits their goals and ambitions.. 

Conversely, some voice the argument that early commitment to a career can be limiting for young people. By having a career goal in place, students can more effectively develop the appropriate skillset in order to equip themselves with the knowledge needed to pursue that career. It can be difficult for a young person to make a career decision with the understanding and knowledge of the world that they have at that age",1
"I don't think i'll have a great future. I'm just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. When all those have I accomplish by the future im going to look at the ones who would bully me or say things about me and just say what happened to you? I know for a fact if to accomplish those goals in the future they will become true. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place.

In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I would never give up in something that I like or something the was my passion. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I don't think I would fit right in. Everyone should try to make the best out of you.. I don't know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. All i gotta say is that, no one should give up on their dreams or on what they want to do cause i know everyone can do it and they accomplish there dreams, you can always make everythinmg right you just need the riht moment and need for us to be strong and do it.

Writting SOL Grade 8

Before, I would always like to try and play the guitar. I don't really know what they are doing to me. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. Doubt I can learn, but I can always try to play hem or one of them.

Another, thing I like to do is workout/exercise. In the future I will just not now cause I can't jus try i can't say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt 'll fit right in. My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosen't have that type of money to pay the surgery. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. That's why I always got to try on it. I always tried to play the flute. Never give up on big dreams like these. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and i've been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment.

Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I can't do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i don't even know. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. Doing workout/exercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I always like to sing along with music or people. I have played with my brother before but i'm always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades i've been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I can't. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I don't know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. I'm not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops.

Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. I used to be in boot camp. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. I will not only make them proud cause i'll also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully.

I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i don't even know if i'll be abke to accomplish it and make it.

All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. Yet i still look fordward a amazing future that i probably cannot have. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosen't look like it",0
"As Winston Churchill so astutely concluded, success is attained from being able to move from failure to failure without diminishing enthusiasm. Looking at my own journey, I have had to confront my fair share of mistakes, yet I have used them as a learning opportunity to better myself and my understanding of a particular situation. Mistakes are an inescapable part of the journey towards success - without making mistakes we are unable to learn and grow. Thinking about the repercussions of my decisions not only promotes accountability, but it also helps to maintain a positive reputation and the faith of those around me.. 
Success does not come without encountering failures along the way. Consequently, I believe it is essential to be aware of the possible outcomes and consequences before taking any action",1
"Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals.

If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. Students will start getting bad grades.

So, after this many reasons we all know that getting involved in the extracurricular activities can really hurt students. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. All this shows that students should choose to be in the activities if they want to not that they are forced to. . They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation.

Having this much pressure can affect students's grades. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. Joining these activities is neither healthy nor good for grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family.

Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work",0

One way to meet new people without speaking is through body language and nonverbal cues. If someone is open to conversation, approach them slowly and calmly, introducing yourself with a few details about your life and/or interests.

Having a pet is another great way to meet new people without having to say much. On the positive side, you could make new friends, find a new job, or even form a meaningful relationship. If you don’t have a pet, you can still try to make friends with people who have one – consider taking your pet for a walk around your neighborhood and striking up a conversation with the other pet owners.

Of course, as with any situation, there are potential positive and negative scenarios associated with meeting new people. When you enter a room, look around and make eye contact with the people in the room. Animal lovers are naturally drawn to animals, so if you have a pet, it’s likely you will have conversations with those who are also drawn to your pet. As long as you stay open to the possibilities, however, and use your best judgment, the potential positives far outweigh the target negatives.. It’s also easy to tell when someone wants to stay to themselves or wants to talk. On the negative side, you could experience bullying or rejection. Smile and nod your head or wave at people you’d like to get to know better",1
"However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow.

I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone else's life there is nothing better than our own behavior. People follow others because they like the other person's personality does not matter is it good or bad.            . The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. In my opinion people's actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others.

Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media.

Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. The actions as words are powerful over another's person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are.

I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. It is like when someone ask a child, "" what do you want to be when you become an adult""",0
"For example if your lossing a bussines or challnge do not bring nagitive atomsphere around it because it would never let your mind to have more oppotrunity that you could done more.

In my piont of view, failing or lossing is lie if you do not try hard for the intersting and successful goals. However, a lot of people belives this quote, because success is nothing with haveing enthusiasm and, lossing or being fail on something and being positive about it.

First, Haveing successful life without challenges is result of being fail in your success. Prime Minster Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" This quote indecteds that becoming successful is a lie in life that dose not have challenges,failures and have hard time in life to achive your goals and, without making it intersting. Make your challenges intersting it dose not matter if you fail it it matter how you play it.. If you are lossing a challenge it okay to loss but with positive thought and never give up on the difficults challenge you have to face in you way to successful life and gaols. However a lot of people gives up on the diffecult challenges because its too hard for them to handle and at end they would have more diffcult thing to face. For example if you face your challenges later in life you would have the benfits from that hard or easy challenges.

secondly, makeing you challenigs intersting would led to be come successful, the reason why because having intersing and positive attuide towards your challengs would make it easire to handle. The reason why you should have challenges in life to become a succesful its to make you a a better person in life and to make you a critical thinker and to garner your all skills and your talents for the better future",0
"Though he had contemplated multiple scenarios, he wasn't sure what choice would be the best for his long-term success. . He had chosen a path that was promising in the short-term but led to a dead-end in the long-run. 

On the other hand, had John consulted experts or authorities about his life's important matters, his decision may have been different. He made the choice without consulting any experts or authorities and soon found himself in a difficult situation. He felt that the best way to approach it was to make the decision on his own. Seeking guidance from experts and authorities generally makes life easier since they are more informed and experienced in a certain area. In addition to their expertise, experts and authorities are also better equipped to consider all the potential risks and outcomes of a situation, making them an important source of guidance. 
John had to make an important life decision about his career path. Furthermore, it can lead to a successful life in the long-term",1
"Conversely, those who take classes from home or online may experience a lack of meaningful social interaction, but may still be able to connect with classmates and teachers online.. In contrast, attending a traditional school involves in-person instruction from an experienced teacher and allows students to gain hands-on experience. This can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on each student. 

Finally, there is the impact on social interaction that needs to be taken into account. At the same time, studying online or at home provides more flexibility, allowing students to set their own schedule and work in their own space. With regard to standardized testing, such as the SOL, those who have taken classes from home or online may do well, if they have taken courses that have prepared them. 
Studying online or at home and attending a traditional school both have their advantages and disadvantages. For those studying online or at home, the lack of a structured learning environment can make it easy to become distracted, resulting in potentially lower learning outcomes due to the lack of accountability. 

In terms of academic performance, students studying from home will have to learn to manage their time and become self-motivated, in order to be successful in their courses. Attending a traditional school may give students more opportunities to interact with other students and form meaningful relationships",1
"but the change is not enough many peoples think the opposite and they never will change their minds that the bad thing are right and is very sad see peoples thinking about it they need to open their eyes and see what is really happening around their environment. i will try my best the change is near to you..

"Even in the movie no one likes the the bad character because they are mean, bad, and no good to others but to harm them and put them in danger. Having a good character is very important in our everyday life, furthermore having a good personality will also effect a persons character so in order to have a better character you need to have a good personality.

Some people say that we can't choose our character because it's beyond our control, however choosing your character is not hard you just need to have a good personality and have to be nice to others. A few years ago my uncle was invited to a wedding party but he wasn't sure what to wear, however some some of his friend told him to wear something casual but that didn't fit his character because he was a boss of a company, therefor many of his coworker would see him there so he decided to wear a suit because it was best for his character.

We choose our own character by the way how we talk to other people. For example if my brother speaks to others in a good manner people will always respect him. One day a customer complained to the manager about how he was being rude to her, so the manager decided to fire him from his job.

We choose our character based on how we dress. Being nice and respecting others will represent a good character of you. Having a good character shows that you are a good person, but if you decide to have a bad character people no longer will trust you and you will be worthless to others, so this is why we choose our own character.

We choose our own character because our character is based on how we interact with other people. A persons character is based on their personality.                           . Its easy for people to choose a character for themselves either a good or a bad character. He was always mad therefor no other employees wanted to talk to him. Some people dont have a good character and that's why people neither wants to trust them or talk to them. Everyone chooses their own character no matter if you are small or big. All a person has to do to have a nice character they have to dress properly they need to have good manners and don't be rude to others and this is all it takes to have a good character. If a person has a job interview and he wants to look good then he has to wear a dress that fits his character and makes him that he wants the job. Other people may say its hard for us to choose our character traits because we are not able to, however for some people it's hard but the things that a person does in their everyday life those things chooses their character it determines if they have a good character or not. Most people that we don't know how to choose our character traits, therefor choosing a good character do not need any special skills. It is very easy for someone to change their character, whatever you choose to be that will be your character. people can present themselves as neat person by the way how they dress in public or anywhere else. A coworker of mine was very rude to customers",0
"Technology had people changed a lot during this generation. Also, people used to go watch a movie or hangout at least, but now people stay at home because they can see the movies or playing videogames with other people online.

In conclusion, people don't hangout like they used to, they don't go shopping anymore, now they only want to be at home. For example, if they want pizza they just order it online or they saw a cute dress, but they didn't wanted to go to the store and buy it, they just order it online. It's a distraction that's taking away from not talking to family, friends, etc. Back then, people always went outside and play with their friends in the streets. This is how people is now, they don't see the importance of talking to each other, they only want to know about what people say about them in social media.

People now does not want to go shopping stores anymore, which this means that stores are closing because of people buying everything online. I'm not saying it's a bad to have technology, what i'm saying is that now people don't hangout like they used to, they don't go shopping anymore now, they only want to be at home this is why, I considered a negative effect to people's lives.

Now almost teenagers, don't hangout with their friends anymore because they just can face time or call them without going out of their house. It was fun to play with other people, people enjoyed it. And they get it to their house, so they don't go all the way there.

In this generation, almost everyone stays at home because they just want to be alone watching Netflix or being in their cellular device. Now, if they want to be play with other people, they just download a game on their cell phones, computer or even on social media; now they have games too. So buying everything on online is the new thing on technology, therefore people now doesn't need to go out to buy what they need, now people just can order it that's why, they are being more lazy. If they do hangout they are only on their cellular devices and not socializing; that's mean to the person that they are hanging out.                                . I get that people use technology because of their jobs, but for other people is a distraction. Sometimes they even got the chance to meet more people. This why it's not a good thing of having technology, because is keeping people away from the other people. But, what i have seen technology is a negative effect on peoples life. This means that now, almost everybody are so into technology in certain way. Also, about what people say about them in social media and if they get tag in a picture. Technology, it may be a helpful tool, but it's also a distraction which affects adults and children. They are only worried about their social media for example, they only see how many likes, comments and followers they get",0
"Allowing cell phone use in school potentially gives students wider access to educational resources, although it is important to ensure that students are using phones responsibly in class.

As an alternative to forbidding cell phones in school, some schools are promoting responsible use through policies that ask students to switch their phones to silent during class and take digital breaks. Texting and playing games on cell phones during class time can serve to distract students from their learning. 

In some cases, students may use cell phones for educational activities in school, such as researching and writing assignments. 
Cell phones are becoming increasingly prevalent in schools, and this raises concerns about their potential impact on students' academic performance. Other schools are proposing a technological solution, such as network monitoring software, to track how students use their devices on school premises.. Studies have found a correlation between frequent cell phone use and lower academic performance, though this does not necessarily mean that cell phone use causes poor academic performance",1
"A positive attitude can bring people together. For example, a great job , good friends, and a wonderful family to spend for the rest of your life. Secondly,

when your team is ready to give, but it is you who persuade them not to. With a positive attitude it can also be a success in life. Being too positive to the peeple around you isn't always a good thing they might push you around of how nice you are, but do not let them drag you down just beacuse of who you are.

Success in life come from many things knowledge, great personlity, cleverness or a positive attitude.

Success comes from hard work, but it does not mean having a great personality or a positive attitude. Being nice to the people around you gives a positive vibe in the room or wherever you are.

Having a positive attitude is a nice thing when you meet people everyday. You can give them your first good impression if you are applying for a job or at school.

A positive attitude can get you in to many things firstly, make a good impression to you boss. Do not give up if you wanna have a succesful life.. Because of how successful you are and to not ever give up. Attitudes are one of the most important things in human characteristics and it also define us.

An attitude that people most adore is positivity. So, a nice attitude can also one of the success leading to a successful life.

However, Having too nice or a very positive attitude can get people very annoyed or jealous. Thirdly, be nice to people if they're being nice to you too",0
"
The benefits of participating in extracurricular activities are numerous; not only do they provide students with an opportunity to practice real-world skills relevant to their fields of interest, they also bolster a student's overall educational experience, help foster creativity, and even increase a student's chances of obtaining employment upon graduation. The more time they take away from academic pursuits, the more likely it is to impact their grade-point average. This means that grades should factor into a student's ability to participate in activities, and they should be willing and able to balance their academic performance with their extra-curricular activities.. However, one factor that should be considered when researching the impact of extracurricular activities on a student's grades is the amount of time they need to devote to the activity",1

"All the people have to put a positive attitude and their job, school, home and in the general life and are going to be the things change.

sometimes in the life that people need a push and a person with positive attitude can be that push.

If a person dont have positive attitude that person always is going to do everything wrong, because if a person dont believe in herself nobody can do it.. All the people say In the life all have to be positive because if i have to do something and i do my best with my best attitude, im going to be fine with the result, because i give everything. For example: Generic_Name want to be part of the marine she love the Marine, but her parents said is too much difficult is impossible for youa but Generic_Name have positive attitude.

The positive attitude always is going to be the key to success in life, because it is the base of everything all the peoples have to believed, is dosent matter what other people say or do, because in the future the only responsible for the things is going to be you nobody also. People with positive attitude always have good friends, because they listen that problems and them say All is going to be fine just wait for the right time.

My mom always say Believe in God and be positive.

After the rain the calm come. The positive attitude is the key to success in the life, because a person with good attitude good energy always is accepted, a person with positive attitude always is happy, because they believe thta everything is possible, that people with good energy they trasmite good energy to everyone around they, the positive attitude os the key to success in here reasons why: More effective in the job,

better relationship with family and friends and good life in general.

Positive attitude is more effective in the job, because we have to believe in our self for example; Generic_Name is working in a company they have a big project and everybody say This is too much we cant do this all this is wrong but Generic_Name say all is possible in a teamwork, is very effective if all the pieces are good nothing cant be wrong Generic_Name always have good attitude and is that why the boss always say go and ask for help to Generic_Name.

"but in during the summer break you get to relax all day summer is the time to hangout with your friends and famiy and to go to vacation to enjoy life too and not think about school or work that is what summer is all about and for educators saying that students are not going to remember what they learned in school. for spring break should always be in March not in April cause it has always been spring break in March spring break should be 2 weeks to take a break from school and to come back in school with a fresh mind to get ready to go to school and learn. so the students can be prepared the only break in fall is thankgiving which is only a week that seems fair cause is just the 2nd holiday in November having breaks is always a good thing i don't know why some people hate it it gets you time to think about things it helps people a lot to relive stress on people it makes people happy and puts a smile on people's faces and that is all i have to say about all the breaks for the seasons. i think summer break should be for 2 months so people can have a break from school cause i know how school can be stressful for students cause they have to worry about a lot of things passing their classes passing their sols that gets stressful to students. cause that is the most important things in school i think for winter break has to be 2 weeks cause of chrimstmas and new years that time is too enjoy those 2 holidays with your family and then come back to school in january.     . Students should enjoy summer break, cause they would not have to worry about school and they can get to relax some educators should not complain about summer break being too long cause having a long break is better than to go to school cause school you have to do work and do tests. from last year when they come back to school is not true cause some people remember what they learned last year and some don't and i don't think summer break should be 3 to 4 weeks cause most of time students are in school more than they get to have a long break",0
"My own experience shows that when I have hidden my true identity, my relationships have been superficial and I have been unable to reach my full potential in the workplace. Similarly, Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" acknowledges the struggle many of us face when we are unable to be accepted for who we truly are. 
When people are not accepted for who they truly are, it has a devastating impact on interpersonal relationships and professional success. It is clear that authentic acceptance of our true selves is fundamental to healthy relationships and professional success.. Even though we may be able to connect with others superficially, without the ability to be our true selves, we cannot form meaningful relationships or grow in our career",1

Overall, an extended school day has the potential to positively impact a student's academic performance, but certain issues should be addressed before making any revisions to the current school schedule.. Additionally, longer school days could provide students access to speciality programs, such as sports or music, and could offer more time for collaboration in team projects or mentor relationships. 

However, it is important to examine the potential implications of the extended learning time. 
Extending the school day by one and a half hours can offer a range of academic benefits for students. There is the possibility that students may experience undue pressure due to the extra hours in school, which could lead to burnout or decreased motivation. In such cases, adequate access to food and drink is essential. Depending on the activities available, students might be able to spend extra time on their studies and gain new knowledge and skills. Furthermore, the nutrition of students should be considered, particularly with regard to meals that may be needed during the extended hours",1

One Decision Can Change A Person Life!

However, some people might argue with that, because they think that people should not make their own decisions but they should seek guidance from experts to make a better decisions for them.

First, everyone should depends on himself and make a better decisions in life to get more experience for example a student can't get a good grade unless he makes a decisions to pay attention to the teacher and doing the homework.

Second, people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions for example nobody will be by your side all the time and in the hard situations to help you make a good decision and a person should not just think once but twice and think far and know what are the consequences of every decision.

Third, one decision can change everybody life and that is on of the reasons why people should depend on them self because nobody cares about you more than you. Other reason is most of the successful people they started from nothing but they made a good decisions and they became successful.

In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because first everyone should depends on himself in life to get more experience second people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions third making decisions make people stronger and know what to do in a hard situation.

Whatever it's about lying is never the answer to solve problems it makes it worse. When your honest more people can trust you and, the more people that trust you the better of a person you are. Being honest is needed everywhere because if everyone was a liar our country woudn't be good. It doesn't matter how badly you want it it's not yours. You decided to take him when he left it there and, he asks you ""Have you seen my toy"", The best option is to give it back or tell him that you have it don't lie and take it. The boy's mother bought him that and it wouldn't be nice to just take it from him. I think that honesty is so important because, being honest can make you gain trust from others. Honesty makes life easierit helps by telling the truth everyone can get along. However, when it comes to suicidal thoughts or someone isnt feeling good tell the truth to an adult even though your friend told you not to you did a great thing for your friend, you might have saved his life. The boy would feels sad and, the mother would not like that too and, you wouldn't feel good after because lying hurts. For example, say you stole something and it was your friends toy. What ever the situation is good or bad you still have to tell the truth because it is good for everyone and, yourselves. You loose trust, you don't get anything out of it, and you just seem like a bad person by lying. You can always tell the truth because being honest is always helpful and, good because, you did a good thing. Telling the truth is always the right choice to do in any occasion.",0
"In addition, allowing students to visit businesses and learn about the types of work they do can provide a number of potential benefits, such as connecting them with professionals who can offer guidance. 
As schools look to prepare students for the future, it is important to research the different types of career pathways that are available. One way to enable students to gain valuable experience is to partner up with local businesses to offer educational opportunities. By research the different types of career pathways available and partnering with local businesses to provide students with educational opportunities, schools can help their students become more aware of their interests and the potential of them in their future.. These opportunities allow students to understand their interests and appreciate their value in regards to their future",1

"Additionally, computers offer larger screens, making them better suited to conducting online classes and lessons. 
The use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes comes with both pros and cons. Additionally, many online educational resources can be accessed from cell phones, making learning easier and more accessible. Conversely, if not used properly, cell phones and computers in the classroom can lead to disruption, distractions, and even misuse of technology, leading to a decline in educational outcomes.. On the positive side, cell phones provide students with instant access to the internet, allowing them to easily search for information and conduct research. However, they may not always be available or be intimidating for younger students to use, as well as potentially too expensive for some schools to provide. Additionally, they can be used for cyberbullying, contributing to an unsafe environment that makes learning difficult. Computers provide more control over what websites can be accessed and can block potentially harmful content. 

Compared to cell phones, computers offer a more controlled learning environment that is less prone to distraction and misuse. On the other hand, cell phones can be a major distraction, pulling students' attention away from the lesson at hand. Students can find more in-depth information, explore topics more effectively, and become more tech-savvy. 

Whether allowing cell phones or computers in the classroom for educational purposes, the potential impact on a student's education is immense",1

Gathering different perspectives can help you make more informed decisions, open up new avenues of learning, and create new relationships..

It is often said that “actions speak louder than words” – and indeed, setting a good example through one’s own behavior and choices can be an effective way to influence other people. While setting a good example is one reliable method, there may be better ways to influence other people depending on the situation.. Ultimately, the best approach may arise from an understanding of the individual’s needs and preferences. Demonstrating the desired behavior or attitude can show others what is valued and expected, and provides them with a template for following that example. However, there may be more impactful and direct ways to influence those around us.

Speaking openly and persuasively on the issue is one key way to influence others. Doing so can help to spark ideas and challenge perspectives in a way that simply modeling the desired behavior may not. By engaging in discussion or debate, we can both present evidence for a particular point of view and invite counter-arguments. Furthermore, addressing a wide variety of individuals allows a message to reach diverse audiences, and to be tailored in a way that increases its persuasive power.

In some cases, a combination of behavior and discussion may be the most effective method of influencing others. By providing an example to follow and discussing why it is being pursued, it is possible to shape the thoughts and beliefs of those around us",1
"It also motivates them, making it easier for the student to achieve their goals.

However, other educators stress the importance of focusing on achievement rather than praise. Some educators believe that praising is more effective and has a greater impact on a student’s self-esteem. When it comes to analyzing the effectiveness of these two methods, opinions are often divided. Similarly, too much emphasis on achievement can result in students becoming fixated on perfectionism, placing unrealistic standards on themselves. 

While opinions may vary, research suggests that a balanced approach which combines both praising and achieving is the most effective way of building self-esteem in students. By providing meaningful praise and setting achievable goals, students can increase their self-confidence and develop a positive self-image.. 

When it comes to building self-esteem with students, both praising and achieving have both notable benefits and drawbacks. They argue that praising encourages students to strive for excellence and appreciate their strengths. By achieving meaningful goals, students become better equipped to build confidence and a positive self-image. But, when excessive, praising can also create doubts in students’ ability and cause them to become dependent on praise. This allows them to feel proud of their accomplishments and generates a rewarding sense of satisfaction. A focus on achieving allows students to build self-confidence in the long-term, while praising can provide a short-term improvement in morale. 
One popular method of building self-esteem in students is to employ either praise or a focus on achieving",1

I was a little girl with a lot of energy, goals and really confident about myself, I enjoyed being in presentations, ceremonies or anything about being in front of the public. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didn't know If coming to America would change my dream,

everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasn't like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, I'm not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it""

I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school.

Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I don't have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career.

These are just some of the reasons why you should select me to visit and learn more about your company, I know you may have more applications of students with better grades and experience than me, but no all of them have the passion and enthusiast that I have, because this wouldn't be just a job, I would be a the biggest accomplishment for me..

"Teachers have chores or duties they must preform at home like shopping for groceries or picking little brother or sister from school. For example, a student can be a player in a local soccer or basketball team, adding more hour will give the student less time to practice and get ready to the game or match and the student will also have little time to do his/her homework or complete an assignment or project given to them. The student having less time to practice is going to take a big tow on his/her team. I think if the school board is going to add more time to the school they should high the pay of the teacher because it take time off their schedule.. The decision of adding ninety minutes to the school day is going to interrupt what the teacher and student do in their everyday life. It could also be that they have another place to work at after school in order to earn more money. Both students and teacher have busy lives this decision is going to effect them.

There are many reasons why adding one hour and a half is bad but these are the ones I could come up with. I disagree with the school board's plan to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life.

Not all activities student perform happens in school. More hours in school will ware out the student causing it to effect their grades. I disagree with the school board's idea to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life. This decision will not only effect the student but the teachers too.

Everyone wants to go home and relax from a long day work. Maybe the student is a very good player and his/her team needs him/her,he/she having small time to practice will make the team lose the match. Adding an hour and a half to the school day can affect the student progress at home. Some teachers have families they have to take care of. They also have doctor or dentist appointment they have to attend or have to take their children to. Students should have more time to study at home, rest and prepare for the next day. Technically, students spend seven hours in school and seventeen hours at home regardless of what time they sleep or what they do when they get home.

"He did just enough to satisfy his needs and felt that it was better to be safe than to take any risks. Nevertheless, she was still interested in growing in the workplace and aiming higher in her career. 

All three individuals had different perspectives on Michelangelo's saying, and each had found a way to apply it to their life. She had taken a job at a local business as a receptionist and was content with her work. 

Finally, Peter was a middle-aged man who had grown complacent over the years. He devoted himself to teaching others the importance of reaching for the stars. She found it inspiring but also intimidating. He mostly worked on short-term tasks and was reluctant to commit to long-term goals.

"While this type of learning can be advantageous in certain ways, it can also present drawbacks that should be considered. 

One of the primary benefits of learning from home is the flexible nature of the learning environment. While there are drawbacks to learning from home, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, and with careful guidance from educators, students can still have successful and beneficial educational experiences.. 

Overall, schools should offer this type of learning as an option as it allows students to engage in the material in an accessible and flexible way. Additionally, online courses provide students with greater accessibility to materials, classes, and educational resources than would be available without online learning. Without direct human interaction, there can be reduced understanding or even confusion in regard to certain topics. This provides students with the ability to further their understanding of topics and stay up to date with new information. Students can complete their work when and where it is convenient for them, giving them the opportunity to develop their own schedules and manage their time more effectively. Additionally, there can be a lack of motivation and drive in completing work or engaging with tasks. Students may struggle to maintain their focus and develop connections with their teachers or peers due to the lack of physical presence in the classroom. 
In recent years, the use of online and video conferencing to facilitate education has become increasingly popular. This type of learning provides students with the ability to attend classes from the comfort of their home, allowing them to learn in an environment that is more comfortable and suited to their individual needs and preferences.

This can help students stay focused and engaged while completing their school work. Working on the computer is also a great benefit, as students are able to track their progress and find information quickly. With the right balance of productivity and breaks, doing school work at home offers students a variety of beneficial learning opportunities..

Many students feel pressured to decide on a career by the time they enter high school, but this is not always a good idea. These steps could include talking with family, guidance counselors, and mentors; considering courses and activities that are related to the field of interest; researching potential job opportunities; and exploring education and specialized training opportunities. At this age, they typically lack the experience required to make a well-informed decision due to their age and the potential for carelessness. Through this process, students can gain valuable insight into their career options, make an informed decision, and ultimately achieve greater career success.. It is essential for students to take the time to explore what interests them, consider their skills and talents, and to try different activities to determine the career that best fits them.

"The most important thing is help our community by pick up trash and cleaning the community. Some people accomplished their goals in life, but some people dont do nothing to accomplished what they want. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. It depends of the people some people could be hypocrite and some people could be nice. Being active is very important because of your health. Some people could rape you or stole the money you have in your wallet. People always says that things happen for a reason. Imagine if we accomplish more, if we are always doing something. If people accomplish what they want, there, would be no purpose. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. Helping other people good or bad. In mt opinion people should accomplish what they want in life. By doing the chore is our responsibly because they could be mad.

My second reason, helping our community. I would like to accomplish my goals in life; there are three thing that I would like to accomplish: having a success career, graduate from high school with an advance diploma, and studied the area of medical. I hope people could accomplish something in life.. Our free time we could be helping the community so it doesnt pollute like other countries.

My last reason, being active anywhere we are. Your health is very important because you need to eat right and do exercise or workout. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash, so the community doesnt pollute where we live. our health is important because if we dont care about our health, we could get disease. I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. By always doing something our health could be healthy, and eat a good diet. We could accomplish more by: helping our parents, being active, and helping our community.

My first reason, We could be doing something by helping our parents. Some people accomplish something and some people dont accomplish nothing. Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Helping them with the chores would be a great choice because they would not be too tired from work. It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Doing one hour of exercise, workout, or something it could be good for our health. Helping our parents is good because they help us when we were little. Being active is very important for you and other people.

Helping your parents is a great option because most things could be done. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash so it doesnt pollute the our where we live",0
"my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. My dad was in the Marine Corps and fought in the Vietnam war, he also worked as security in the American embassy in Generic_City. Students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they don't know. And some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. That want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. Growing up i started seeing my interest and also had options on what i would like to do in the future. until i started by little learning how to use the products. Also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school. They also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life.

Now for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. I rather live with animals then humans to be honest. In this prompt i agree and disagree, because in societies now in days some students do know for sure what career they want to study/become when older. It all depends on the student, For example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. So its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future.

I would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. For example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. Some students don't know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. Now a big makeup store at the mall offered me a job their because they loved the way i do my makeup. So i moved on to following my dads foot steps, becoming part of the Marine Corps. I also love doing makeup, since i was little i would always play with makeup and growing up i would buy a lot of makeup but didnt really know how to use the products. Some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. In other cases that i haven't really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. Also it could be that there Mom or Dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter.       . Thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. Some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about. Once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. So i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good because i am saving their lives, but im not always going to save their lives so i didnt want to be a veterinarian because i didnt want to be hurt my whole life work like that",0
"The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home",0
"Churchill's statement that ""failure is not fatal"" is true for three main reasons: first, it is often saying that failure is an opportunity to learn and grow; second, it is accepting failure as a part of life and understanding that it does not define an individual; and third, failure is the impetus for reflection and improvement. Similarly, I persevered in the face of other failures - while my first few businesses did not succeed, I eventually established a successful business venture. 
""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"" is a statement attributed to Winston Churchill which speaks of the important role failure plays in eventual success. My personal experience serves to illustrate Churchill's point - despite failing out of college twice, I ultimately returned with renewed focus and eventually earned my degree. As the quote by Francis Bacon says, ""If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties"".",1
"Not only just NBA players work hard, other people around the world has stories to tell on how they never stopped working harder than before to grow. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Work even harder then you worked before. Based on my experieneces, do I agree or disagree with Emerson's statement. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. .These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Raplh Waldo statement.. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. For example Lebron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest",0
"I think that is a good idea for many students that can't coming to the school or have a work.

One of the benefits is that the students can wake up late, because the class is online so, you can take the class in the afternoon, you can stay in your home relax in the bed also if you want eate you can do.

Some guys work in the morning, in the night or all the day.

I have a friend that he work of

8am to 5pm and he always is tired and this can help his, for the future.

He can study in the night and have his class with tranquillity.

Some people think that this a way to lose the time, but I do't think so.

Because I believe that you can be a profesional person if you want.

My friend don,t wanna work in a restauran all the time, he want to be a mechanic and if he take class online his dream can be convert a reality.

In conclusion I believe that if you want something if have a dream, you need to follow your dreams I don't care if is hard NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.

If you have the opportunity you need to take it.. I agree with this way to learn and study",0
"Most people encounter big decisions often throughout their lives, so getting advise from numerous people can help you get more input on something, and may end up helping you make a final decision. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.

After getting advise from multiple people around them, the decision maker may be able to make the best choice possible, as they've gotten new thoughts and ideas. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. Asking for help or for some advise from those around you can help you make the best possible choice because you've gotten a lot of new information and opinions that you wouldn't have gotten if you had only asked one or no one at all for advise. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. By getting more people's input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise you've gotten.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by not getting any biased opinions. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. . Have you ever had a really important decision you had to make? Did you feel overwhelmed because you didn't know what you should do? Asking for help or advise from people such as friends and family around you can really help alleviate all that stress. The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. Getting help from others around you can help you make the best choice you can. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.

A final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice they're going to make. Seeking multiple opinions can really help someone make a better choice when dealing with decision making.

One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input. For example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. Making an important choice can seem a little bit easier and less stressful after seeking advise from multiple people. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. Asking numerous people can be a huge help when making an important decision. By asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision",0
"
    Two is better than One is an innovative program that seeks to bridge the divide between younger and older generations by promoting collaboration and inter-generational understanding. I will forever be thankful for the experience Two is better than One gave me.. Communication between different generations is essential for this program to succeed, as insights and perspectives from both younger and older students can be mutually beneficial.

Personally, I benefitted greatly from using Two is better than One while studying for my driving license exam. Having the assistance of someone from a different age group helped me to better understand difficult concepts, provided helpful tips for passing the test, and increased my motivation to keep studying. The program promotes the idea that success can be achieved through failure, as knowledge and understanding is gained every time a challenge is attempted. I learned that having a helping hand, even if it’s from an unlikely source, can make the biggest of challenges seem more achievable",1
"Even if students don't actively use their phones to harass their peers, having them in the classroom gives people the tools to do so, and can result in disruption and decreased focus on learning. Since students can use their phones to document the lectures, classmates can be concerned by privacy issues, leading to feelings of mistrust and decreased morale. Cell phones often become a distraction, leading to students using them for messaging, surfing the internet, and accessing social media instead of studying. 

Furthermore, phones can be a source of cyberbullying. The potential risk of decreased educational performance, decreased learning environment, and cyberbullying outweigh the potential benefits, which are usually quite minimal.. 
According to recent studies, allowing students to bring their cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom can have detrimental effects on their learning. 

All in all, cell phones should not be allowed for educational purposes in the classroom. This behavior can lead to decreased academic performance and increased time needed to complete assignments. Additionally, bringing cell phones into the classroom can disrupt the learning environment",1

"Many schools have partnerships with companies that allow student to explore because many student have goals or student have many opportunities to have partnerships with companies and they can explore a big business or to have connection another place to use partnership with companies.

people can have business because they got a good study and they have goals to exploring business and they can have easy partnerships with another companies and showing more opportunities to the futures.

many student have goal to get a business in the futures because many young man have experience how to find partnership or connection in another place or other country, and many of young man have brain to think how can make the good things of the life, and the technology can help now for every body how can investigate many things, and have a good employment to work many people there and every year can grow a employment with the business because good people can work about and companies can pay of employments better.

some school teach student about how can drive a business how can open a companies start building a employment because many companies can not grow without employment work strong every day because most people can have the same idea like professional student or some student graduate for business class so they have more integenci than many peolple who can not use a companies of a business ",0
"In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. In my case, Its music. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill.

I've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what i'm currently playing. Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters' birthday. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. Everyone has a talent or skill. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.

My music skills have yet to improve, but until then I will continue trying new ways of music.. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. She really enjoyed it. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.

Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.

My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous",0
"I,d kinda have to agree with micky here (least favorite tmnt turtle) because, if you don't aim high but go for short you might not get anywhere in life.

Like when you aim low like only work in fastfood and only get paid minimum wage forever, then get a job for a company like samsung of nintendo and get paid more then that.

1 of the examples is the debt/taxes you want to live a good life when you're down here right so do you want to live with so little money or more money that you save from a good job.

My 2nd example of this is like athletes if you learn what you did right, or wrong to achive that goal you have to push yourself further then what you are right now.

but if you succeed at the low standers your more like meh okay.

Though I can see the other way too saying you aim low but at least your aiming for something which i can get behind.",0
"An additional way to show intelligence is working out puzzles and strategies for problem-solving, such as creating a spreadsheet or other type of presentation to explain complex concepts.

To show off talents, it can include skills in music, art, writing, and other creative talents. Additionally, someone who is a skilled writer can demonstrate their talent through experiences such as writing short story or articles for publications.

To show off one’s athletic ability, it can be anything that involves physical strength, flexibility and endurance. 
One of the best ways to show intelligence is by having a deep understanding of a particular subject matter, through diligently studying and researching facts about that area of expertise. Being able to show how they achieve higher endurance by continually increasing times for running a certain distance or being able to lift heavier weights are both ways to show athletic abilities.

The key to each of these skills is to demonstrate the qualities that make them unique. Being able to explain why these skills have been developed, such as growing up in a particular environment or actively seeking out related opportunities gives it more credibility. 

Overall, many unique skills across different areas such as intelligence, talent and athletic abilities, all lend to a person’s individual identity. Reflecting on how you have been able to develop these skills and demonstrating how they are unique from others is a great way to prove to the world that you possess a special and rare combination of attributes.. This could include being able to memorize an entire text book on a certain subject, or being able to make a beautiful painting in a short amount of time. For example, if someone is good at playing the guitar and participating in choirs, that is one way to demonstrate their talent. As an example, for someone who wants to show off their athletic ability, they could demonstrate things such as running, weightlifting or playing a sport",1
"you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you , it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

Problems happen to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. You can't prevent problems from happening but you can have less you you do things correct the first time around. It happens to the best people and there is no way to stop problems from coming. There are people that can help you, you're never alone. You need to think if others will be effected, you can't just ignore a problem sometimes it could become bigger. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character.

Some problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and you'll try to fix it. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier.

There are times that problems involve more than one person, and won't effect you only but others as well. We should show our best when problems come up due to the fact that sometimes there are problems that can put you in danger or hurt you. You'll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.

You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you, it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

Everyone goes through something, tough problems can happen to anyone you just need to keep your head up and do what is right.. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. When a problem occurs, do you try your best or do you simply not care? Problems are a common thing and happens to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. It doesn't matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. Even if you try your best it may not be how you want it to be, there are others who will help guide you, to have a good outcome. There are problems that make it seem that you can't handle it alone. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. You never have to do anything alone, you might need the help of others and it's okay to do so.

There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. Some of these things will teach you lessons, maybe you did the wrong thing but you'll be wiser and know better. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you don't know.

An example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesn't want you going far away and need your help. An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better.

"Rowling persisting despite rejection of her Harry Potter manuscripts, there’s something to be learned from their perseverance. 
As I dug into the personal stories of successful people, one common theme stood out – their resilience in the face of failure. I realized that to stay focused and motivated, it was important to create an environment that nurtured learning and positive self-belief. As I processed these feelings, I was able to reflect on how failure has shaped me as a person and pushed me farther down the path that led me to success. 

I was grateful for the support of my family and friends, who provided me with the encouragement and emotional support to stay the course.   

I was reminded of my own experiences of coming up short and using those moments as a springboard for growth. Whether it was Mark Zuckerburg learning to code after multiple failed attempts to launch a software company, or J.K. Through the combination of stumbling, finding solutions, and never giving up, I was able to take failure in stride, to ride the wave of success.. 

I identified the ways that failure had contributed to my own growth and the impact it had on helping me reach my goals",1
"Additionally, the use of an educational app or online platform can help improve engagement in the classroom. 

In sum, while cellphones can be beneficial in terms of access to information and resources, it is important that clear rules and proper regulation are implemented in order to achieve an optimal learning environment.. On the other hand, if not properly regulated, the use of cellphones can lead to distractions and can prevent better concentration on the lesson. 
The use of cellphones in classrooms can have both positive and negative effects on student performance. On the one hand, it can allow students to quickly access information and stay connected with their peers to facilitate group work. Furthermore, the proliferation of smartphones can lead to issues of cyberbullying and phubbing, which can negatively impact student mood and attitude",1
"It enables us overcome any obstacles that may stand in our path and push us to our full potential; however, success is not exclusively dependent on having a positive attitude. 
It is widely accepted that having a positive attitude helps individuals to achieve success. Furthermore, having a positive attitude can help us discover our passions and achieve our personal objectives, as we recognize the opportunities and meaningful objectives that each day has to offer. Finding simple activities that can be enjoyed in our own time can help to temporarily take our minds away from our worries and stressors. It is important to allow ourselves to feel negative emotions and understand that the fullest potential of success cannot be reached without recognizing our insecurities, doubts, and fears. Even with a positive outlook, success is not always guaranteed. Finally, being surrounded with positive influences and supportive friends and family can help to reinforce our positive outlook and provide us with the optimism and belief of achieving success.. 

One beneficial strategy to maintain positivity when surrounded by negativity is to take a break and focus on something else that brings us pleasure",1
"Four years students they are more ready for the decision and they are have more time to think about what and where they will be in their future, and they got all help from teacher and parent to help that think in mind steady.

Students are mostly don't finish high school three years they have less experiment about college then students who are three years high school, however the three years high school students have more problem then a four years high school students, three years high school students maybe on the time they thinking what they doing next if they can't make it or they are changes they carrer they end up stay with their parent forever into they know what to do next and on the time they off school the those student going to forget everything that they had learn in school and end up failing.

My opinions is every students need more time to think about their carrer in future, before step forward into their life they needs more time to think and do whatever they need in every class and think for their carrer.. For the students who are have problem need help to resolve, they problem are they making more decision that let they think about can the students do it or can the students sure about this decision or that decision, because is a big decision to change one person life and it happen to every students even the greatest student.

Three years students don't have enough time to think more about their future and not 100% sure about they really are in future, have a lot of students who are finish three years high school and have a good jobs or have a good place to live, not everyone the same life so some students before finish three years of high shool know what they are doing and after high school they making other decision. A students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early is a bad idea, maybe have a lot of problem after they are finish high school for three years.

However, finish high school in three years is a good thing to think about it, students will move faraway and move on their life, but that are a small group of students who are thinking one way of their life after three years high school, but the other group of students are have a problem after they finish high school and they need help to resolve the problem they are in",0
"That could be grounds for termination if the person is not able to make a sufficient case for themselves in the future. Neglecting to create a successful first impression can lead to major missed opportunities, or even worse, trouble further down the line.. 

Not creating a successful first impression can mean losing important opportunities in life. People cannot go back and change a poor first impression, so it is key to make sure to leave a strong and positive one the first time. It is not possible to “go back in time” and change a bad first impression; therefore, it is critical that people make sure to leave a positive and lasting impression the first time around. People need to be aware that bad first impressions can have serious consequences, even if they think they can work their way out of the initial poor opinion later. 

In conclusion, making a good first impression is essential. Let’s say someone makes a first impression of being lazy and uninterested in a job. 

Not only does a bad first impression lead to missed opportunity, but it can also lead to getting into serious trouble. Not appearing to be someone of value and positive standing can quickly result in the loss of a lucrative opportunity. 
Making a good first impression is incredibly important for many aspects of life. For example, let’s say an individual is meeting a potential business partner or investor for the first time. If that person neglects to dress for the occasion, appearing unprofessional and unprepared, that could be a deal breaker in terms of convincing the other person to invest in the business. People are often judged by those around them on first impression, and those impressions are lasting",1
"Even the smallest acts of kindness can have a big impact.. It was a strange but heartwarming sight.

Seeing this act of kindness touched me deeply. In addition, it can generally inspire people to do more acts of kindness for others.

It is my hope that more people take the opportunity to perform random acts of kindness wherever possible. As she was doing so, the chicken started clucking in a content manner. Although we were in a hurry to get home, my friend decided to help the chicken after seeing it trapped and unable to escape.

She knelt down and began carefully picking away the brambles from the chicken's enclosure, allowing the chicken to wiggle free. It creates a shared sense of joy and contentment, and helps demonstrate the importance of kindness and compassion in our lives. Doing so can help to foster a more generally understanding and compassionate society. I had gotten to witness an act of kindness that had made both of us feel wonderful.

From this experience, I can say that performing even just one act of kindness can have a positive impact on the people involved. Additionally, it is a great way to give something back to the community and make the world a better place. It showed me that one random act of kindness can make a difference in someone else's life, even if it's something as small as freeing a chicken from some brambles. 
Performing acts of kindness is a great way to bring joy and comfort to those around us. I recently experienced a situation that showed just how beneficial these kinds of acts can be.

I was visiting a local farm with a friend when we noticed that a nearby chicken was struggling to get free of some brambles that had grown over its coop. By performing this act of kindness, my friend had made a difference not just for the chicken, but for me too",1
"For example, having a plan B can assist us in expanding our options and skillsets. However, it can be highly beneficial in both our academic and personal development. 

In my own experience, I have found the opportunity to focus on new topics has enabled me to challenge and broaden my knowledge in a creative way. Additionally, there are opportunities to explore topics we may not initially be interested in but can discover new hobbies and passions. 
Taking the opportunity to learn new things might be intimidating at first – it requires us to open ourselves up to the unfamiliar and break away from what we already know. Being open to trying new activities and topics has allowed me to develop skills and form relationships with people I would not have been able to otherwise. Moving forward, I plan to take any opportunity that arises for me to learn something new and to push myself out of my comfort zone.. This can be especially useful when we find that certain programs we wish to pursue are no longer available",1
"When tasks are shared and each individual does their part, amazing results can be achieved. Additionally, working in groups encourages members to become better listeners and communicators, which can improve not only the task at hand, but also relationships between team members. 

In conclusion, working in a team provides many benefits that cannot be gained working alone. Studies have shown that when individuals are part of a team, they are more likely to have better ideas and more efficient outcomes. When each individual in a team has a role to play, the risk of failure is reduced; if the task isn’t accomplished, the entire team will work together to find a solution. 

Working in a team can be a beneficial endeavor for many reasons. Working with a diverse set of individuals can lead to better ideas, enhanced productivity, and improved team dynamics. Therefore, the advantages of working together far outweigh the benefits of working alone.. Being in a collaborative environment can encourage creativity, foster open communication, and provide an opportunity to mentor and learn from each other.

When working in a team, members’ different skills, experiences, and backgrounds can be applied to the task at hand. Working in a team also allows individuals to use their individual strengths to their advantage, creating a powerful combination to benefit the team.

Team work also promotes shared responsibility and understanding. Having diverse perspectives can help to create and develop innovative ideas and solutions",1
"Additionally, Chinese families and communities place a high value on respect and loyalty. Thus, there is a distinctly different outlook between the two philosophies, with Chinese learning focusing on respect for tradition, while Emerson's is centered on the exploration of ideas.. 
Chinese culture has a long history of Confucian values, which emphasize education and self-improvement through study and contemplation. This is in stark contrast to the philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who values self-reliance, independence, and intuition. For Emerson, on the other hand, self-improvement is achieved not through studying conventional wisdom, but rather through individualism, open-minded exploration, and creativity. To the Chinese, education and tradition are extremely important, and students are taught to learn and grow from the wisdom of their elders",1
"Sometimes it's better to make the right choices because it releases our stress.

Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision. I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but it's the complete opposite. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. It can help you in many ways. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life.

Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. For example, when you're angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life.

Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someone's help. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you don't want to end up one day behind bars.

Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life.                                 . I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. That's the time to express your feeling to someone else. I remember when I decided to break my friend's trophies. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasn't right. Meaning that, it's most likely for you to have a positive mind. I was so mad that I wasn't thinking right",0
"A policy such as this can ultimately have the opposite intended effect, as it may serve to discourage low-income students and other minorities from participating in activities due to the additional difficulty in meeting the required average. 
The subject of requiring students to maintain a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities has caused significant debate among educators, students, and other stakeholders. In one camp, it is argued that requiring students to maintain a certain academic standard helps to reward hard work in the classroom and also encourages them to take their studies seriously as opposed to being a distraction from their academic pursuits. 

My position is that requiring a B average to participate in school activities is an unfair policy that can heavily impact students who are struggling with their school work and put a financial burden on families who already struggle to afford extracurricular activities. 

While the intention of requiring a B average is to ensure students have a strong academic foundation, the potential consequences and disadvantages of such a policy suggest that it is not an effective solution for achieving this goal. On the other side, however, some have raised the point that this policy could unfairly limit the opportunities of some students who may excel in activities such as sports or the arts but lack the academic skills needed to maintain a B average. Furthermore, it could potentially lead to alienation among students who are unable to meet the academic requirements, which would further impact their engagement in school activities. Rather, it is important to provide support and mentorship for struggling students to ensure they receive the education and resources they need to succeed.",1
"The way a person is initially perceived based on looks, body language, and attitude all play a significant role in how they are initially viewed. By making just a few minor changes, a lasting impression can be left on another person that can outshine any first impression based on initial appearances.. Someone who is animated and interesting can be much more attractive than someone who is shy and withdrawn. 

Finally, communication skills play a big part in how a first impression is perceived. 

A person's personality may also be a factor in changing a first impression because it is often easier to see a person's true nature once conversation has been established. Finding someone attractive or not can depend upon someone's individual opinion or preferences. If a person can show that they are genuinely sociable, open-minded, and well-rounded, this can often counter any experience or appearance that was negative at first. However, a person's fashion sense, the clothes and accessories they wear, and even their grooming habits, can also change the way they are perceived. It is usually impossible to hide questionable communication skills, so by honing this aspect of one's personality, it is possible to make a lasting impression. 
Throughout life, first impressions are incredibly important. 

Therefore, through one's looks, personality, and communication, a first impression can and should be managed so that an individual can make the best possible impact when meeting someone for the first time. 

When it comes to looks, it is often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. By making straightforward changes in all of these areas, one's initial impression can be improved. The ability to articulate one's thoughts and communicate clearly can be a very powerful tool in making a positive impression. However, while looks and body language are the ones that are usually noticed first, it is ultimately the attitude and communication skills of a person that can completely change a first impression",1
"some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didn't so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that don't wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because he's so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two.

The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you don't have to worry about for college. Then college is for you and you don't have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you can't stop because people that put the work they don't stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others don't because the were born with golden life.

Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something don't have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you can't stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you don't then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone.                                   . Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines.

The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and don't need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff.

The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you don't have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble",0
"Taking the time to trust one's own judgement is also vital, as well as developing strong decision-making skills at an early age. The benefits of good decision-making can bring profound improvements to our lives, our future, and our families. 
Decision-making is an important task that can have significant consequences in our lives, both positive and negative. Being able to make quick and wise decisions can help us work toward our goals and achieve our potential in the long run.. Seeking advice from loved ones or a professional can help people make confident decisions and understand their options and outcomes",1
"If you have an older siblings that have already gradated high school and have their career they can talk to you and help you out and to tell you what to do.

School counsulers are great people to talk when your looking for a career. You can even ask your parents to help you with your career by giving you some advice to help you out. You can ask your counsuler any questions to help you set up a plan after you graduate high school, talk about why you choosed this career for you, do you have some experiences with this career yet, what do your parents think about this career that you want to have. Help other students who want to have your career as well. Some jobs will help you pay for the college that you will be attending at.

As we read this is why i think students should start pickcing their future careers while they are in high school because. You can also have your counsuler set up a meeting with you and your parents to talk and see what they can do for you.

If you know anybody who has the same career that you want to have. And eventually they will become successful as you are for making the good choices while you were in high school.. Counsulers can help you look for colleges or universities that you wan to attened. Have a talk with them and ask he or she questions about what do you do in your job, how much does your job pay you, how much do you make a year, if they can take you where they work at and see the other employees there and have conversations with them. how much do people with your career make, what does this career do, how much do they make a year. Some parents pay the college for their kids, but i think its better if you pay some of that money with your parents, so they don't have to waste all of their money for you to go college. Students should start picking a career when they entered high school, so they can pick classes in school or ask teachers to help you with your career.

If students start picking a career at a young age they will already have an idea of what to do, they can do research about their career at school. That's why some teenagers start working while they are in high school, so they can start saving money for college. So they will have a plan ready after they graduate high school, go to college, graduate from college, and start looking for jobs of the career that you choosed. The libary is a great place as well you can find books that match up with your career ask they libarians to help you find the right book. Its good to talk people who has the same career that you are studying for because. They have worked hard to get where they are today and they have jobs that they enjoy doing making money and living their best life.

You should start looking for colleges when you are in your junior year of high school because. You can talk them to help them out, answer all the questions they have to ask you, tell them what to do you are looking for colleges to help with their career, show them where you work and show how your job is. When you are looking for colleges you have to check how much you have to pay to attend the college, how much do you have to pay a month",0
"With no designated teachers, students may have difficulties finding help when they need it. Furthermore, learning from home may also lag behind in terms of academic advancements and the use of new technologies compared to those available in school classrooms. For example, students can work on their own schedule, avoid distractions such as conversations with friends, and have more flexibility with practice and assignments. 

Consulting with teachers, counselors, parents, and peers can help students make an informed decision about whether learning at home or in school more closely aligns with their individual academic goals.. 
The decision of whether to attend classes in school or take classes at home is an important one for students to make. Learning at home also eliminates the need to travel to and from school, which can save time and money. 

However, there are downsides to learning at home. Furthermore, without the strict accountability of classroom settings, students may have a harder time staying motivated and on top of their work. Taking classes at home has numerous advantages",1
"At first, I was tired and wanted to give up, but my parents encouraged me to push through and I ended up doing very well on the exam. This experience taught me the value of effort and how no matter how difficult a task is I can achieve success if I work hard and don't give up. My parents always made sure that I was able to help out around the house with chores and errands while making sure that I was able to excel in my studies. 
Growing up in a close-knit family, I was taught very early on the importance of responsibility, hard-work, reliability, and the importance of working well with others. 

One of my favorite life lessons came in high school when I had to stay up late to study for a major test. I was taught life lessons about the value of these qualities through the examples that were set by my parents and siblings. This simple lesson has remained with me ever since and continues to motivate me to strive for success in all areas of life, including this potential job opportunity.",1
"

No matter which side of the argument you fall on, there are countless examples of people who achieved their goals despite settling for a career path while they were still young. Rather than wasting time exploring several unrelated fields, committing to a career at a young age allows students to gain valuable experience and hone their skills, paving the way for possible success. One example is Mark Zuckerberg, who was a 19-year-old Harvard sophomore when he launched the now widely popular platform, Facebook. Ultimately, there will always be advantages and disadvantages to choosing a career at a young age, but for those looking to focus on a specific goal and get a head start, it can be a great option.. Those opposed to making a career choice in their youth are concerned that it will prevent them from exploring other options in other fields, or even from forming an in-depth understanding of their chosen industry. On the other hand, those supporting choosing a career early believe that it gives young people a chance to focus on a specific goal and gives them the determination to strive for it. 

From Zuckerberg’s success story, we can see that committing to a career early in life can set young people up for higher levels of achievement. 
Choosing a career at a young age has both its advantages and disadvantages",1
"Second i will explain about society, and how can be relative to be not a individual person. This may prove that individuality doesn't change the you can not be, what you want be.

There are many ways the can be a ocation of individuality. As the president we can make the same, decision as him to work together or not. In this essay i will talk about some ways the we can work together. They like to be the one the everyone see, the point of attention these people we can call as indiviluatys. Not all them are the like that, because there might be a reason to makes them to be like that. Is not just to be individual is to know how to management your life in your time. you can make your own goal to fight for what you want or to be constantly push it by the world to change you to be something else.

In summary we all have the decision to select which way to follow. Maybe for their background. Finally i will expain how to take decisons, and to make them work. If your try to work with the person to broke the individuality between the person in you, that can be a avance to be relative to other people. This can be a result the Ralp Waldo Emerson, is wrong about to be push it by the world constantly, beacuse you change that and be what you want to be.. Firts i will explain about, job issues and results. There another people the doesn't like to be around others people, because they like to do the things by there own. You can try to work with the person, is not just be a individual person, beause you might need the help of the person one day. Be around of society is sometimes is more complicate then what it looks, mostly if you know people like that, but you can try to work with them or somethings these people chage. The doesn't mean the you can not fight to get your goal, if you don't like your job try to do something the you like been working in a job that you don't like is typical of individuality behave. Many companies work together as a team to get there goels, you can work with other people in your job as a company.

Some people prefert to be alone in many times, these people we can know as asocial. Another occasion on individuality in your job can might be because, you are not doing what you dreamed about to be in the future. I disagree with him because there are many occasions that you need help from someone in life. Also i wrote about hoe we can live around the society, and how we can result conflicts. Try to be anoter person is not just to want to be the person is to make a decision. In your job, might be someone you do not like, because his or her behave. You can make the decision to be push it by the world, or you can make your own decision of what you want to do in life. Finally i explaned how we can take are own decision, to be what we want to do, and what can be goal to follow to change, or fight for it. Many people take the decision to stay in a world that management their life, because they think the is better or because is the easy way. As i went throught about job and result. The president can deciside to work alone, and make the things as he wants but he knows the he needs to work together, we the people in the congress beacuse by himself can not do everything. Some them beacuse they look for help and others change because someone close to them help to change for good.

We all make decisions in life but some those decisons can make us to do something wrong or to be a different person. This people just want to be alone becuase they feel comfortable like that. Prompt

The author Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, about to be individuality",0
"If I choose a career at a young age it's good for me because if I don't know about the career then that time teacher can help me and it's easy for me to study when I am in college. It's easy for me to taking a career course because I already learn when I was young. If I do the really good about a career course then one time i'll get success in my life.

It's important for me because if I finish about a career course i'll get a job or i'll do the business. One day i'll be success in my life and i'll be so happy and my family and we will stay happy.. I agree with this idea and I think it's a good idea for me to choose a career at a young age because it's a good way to start to study. At the young age, if I choose the specific career it's good for me in feature and it's important for me.

Yes, it's a good idea for me because if I choose the career at the young age it's easy for me to study when I am taking a career course. If I do the really good about a career course what I choose one day i'll get success in my life. It is important for me if I choose a career at the young age because when I am taking a career when the teacher ask me the question that time I can easily give them the answer. If I get success in my life i'll be so happy and also my family will be happy.

In Conclusion, if I choose a career at a young age it's good for me and when I'm taking the career course it's easy to take it",0
"Exploring the world and meeting new people are just a few of the ways that you can bring the family together and have a great time. However, outdoor activities provide a way to come together and reconnect with each other. Whether it's going on a nature hike, camping, or some other outdoor activity, it’s a great opportunity to bond with family and reap the stress relief benefits of being outdoors.. Not only is it the perfect way to enjoy each other’s company, but also you can take time away from electronic devices and get back in touch with nature. 
Spending quality time with family has become increasingly difficult in our digital age. Being in nature can help relieve stress and bring peace of mind",1
"For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said,  Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing.

First reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence people. People sometimes do not think about how much money they spend on stuff; at the and of day they use it once, and then forget about it.

On the other hand, people think that the only way to influence someone is by an example. The tv can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it.

Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. I think being an example is something good as long as you don't do what they did wrong.

In conclusion, I think there are more ways to influence people. It could be you influencing someone else or someone influcing you.. In addiction, my mom is someone that consider as an example for me, if she do soemthing wrong it doesn't mean that I am going to do it, too. People think sometimes that influencing means you have to be an example for the person, but in my opinion influencing someone could be through anything like : internet, words, a friend and even family",0
"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. being negative won't help you get what you want, or achieve a goal or a dream because you won't believe in your self and you will just let everything just go, and not really try hard for what you want. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life, Because if you have a negative attitude that means you don't believe in your self or you are insecure so you may not be successful in life; but if you have a positive attitude, and know what you doing is correct, so what you doing will make you successful in life. being positive will make you successful. if you are successful in life that means you are positive, and you are happy that you are doing everything as you want.

being successful means that you have achieve most of the things you want in life like buying a house, a nice car, going to college, or getting a diploma; so you always should stay positive,and try hard for something you want in life. you make your life successful by doing what you want, and trying hard for and not giving up and being negative to be successful you will make mistakes, but you learn of those mistakes, and not make them again , or do better at something you din't do good on the first time, so just keep trying, and stay positive, and be successful in life ",0
"One of the most iconic sights are the blossom trees that bloom for a brief two week period in the spring. The country is awash with a sea of pink and white petals as the sakura, or cherry blossom, trees provide a stunning display of nature's beauty. 
Japan is a lively and beautiful country with plenty of culture and attractions for visitors to explore. 

For a more lively experience, a trip to one of the many bustling Japanese markets is a must. From the Akihabara district of Tokyo, to the bustling stalls of Osaka's Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street, these shopping paradises feature a wide range of items from fresh produce to electronics. Not only can visitors find the perfect souvenir, but the crowded aisles filled with people provides a real glimpse of the Japanese spirit.",1
"Which gives them less time to do their work and study.. The classes will be easier because they will be learning at their grade level, not a grade level above. Imagine all the stress they get when they are taking more classes at a time. They can get stressed by all the homework and classwork they get from all their classes. It is better to take your time then to rush your career.

Students who go the last year of high school have more time to learn more. For example there is a nursing class, carpentry class, electricity class, welding class, and many more that can help them get started. They might also have a job they have to get to save money for their college supplies like textbooks. They also won't have as much homework and classwork to do at a time.

The students will have more career choices to choose from. If they can't take electives then they won't have experiences that may help them.

Lots of work on a students can cause them to be stressed out. Students should not be able to graduate early. If students stay in school the extra year they have more opportunities. If they have more time they will be able to have electives that can help them choose their career. Some students already get stressed by the amount of work they get in regular classes. They can take more classes than those who would graduate early. It also gives them more time to explore different careers they might want to do. The fourth year of high school gives them more time to learn. Students might be stressed out too much",0
"
A four-day school week with each day lasting ten hours may seem to be an appealing option, as it has potential advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and school staff. However, it could be difficult to accommodate certain classes that require in-person student participation, such as science experiments or exercises within a physical classroom setting.

On the other hand, for school staff, a four-day school week with ten hours per day could mean working more hours within those days. It could also allow teachers more flexibility to plan ahead and their teaching approach, as well as the ability to cover more material in a certain amount of time. For students, it would give them more free time in their week to pursue hobbies or focus on individual research projects. Depending on the school's other services, such as extracurricular activities and on-site care, this could mean added demands that would be outside of traditional school hours. It has potential advantages and disadvantages for students and teachers, as well as considerations for the school staff and resources available.. 

In conclusion, a four-day school week with ten hours per day could be a feasible option for your school depending on a variety of factors. Whether this is an attainable option depends on the resources the school has available to provide these services and support staff",1

"It will not only help the students but the school to because if these student are getting there homework done then that will make the school look better . I think that there should be a after school homework club because its hard to understand homework sometimes and you dont know what you are doing exactly but if we were to have these clubs think about how many students would get there work done . Why you didnt pass this test or why couldnt pass this quiz you took maybe if you did that homework you could have past the test , quiz also home plays a big role in school teachers give studnets homework so we can get better at that subject it easier for students not to care about homework ''BECAUSE IT DOESNT MATTER'' but it does and. We might think that homework isnt important but it is homework is worth 10 percent of your grade and sure that might not be a lot but it could really help your grade. Also help them undestand not just give that student the answer to the question they would actually learn and that . And it could really help you like when it comes to test you could know the matrial you need for this test if you did that one piece of homework that one piece of homework could have helped you past that test you probly failed or quiz . Also students would be happy that they got there homework done now they can do whatever they want afterschool becaus ewhat was taking up most of there afternoon is now done .. No matter how many time you try to tell yourself it doesnt matter it does and that is not going to change so do your homework and if this afterschool club happend then homework will be one less thing to worry about . Also some students dont understand the work the teachers give like when you dont understand that class work you were doing in that class how do the teachers expect that the student bring in there homework .

I hard for students to learn middle school student have a lot to do for example students have to worry about getting homework done for all 7 of these classes it isnt easy . This also will get students grades up and might take a B to and A

. I think that if the school had this club it would really help studnets in school and help really understand the work and homework and help them be less stress because it it alot of work for you to get done and espcially if you dont get the work you need to do . Most teachers might give more than one piece of homework some might give 2 some might give 3

pieces of homework .

Students could also ask about what they dont understand they will help students in what they dont understand or what they didnt understand in that lesson that they had .The teacher will explain what you didnt understand , some students just dont have time so maybe that one day that can stay afterschool could help them get all that students homework done . Teacher will also know that students are getting there work done and not just getting the anwser like some students do now when it comes to homework . Other students that are cabelble of doing this work on there own but have a hard time turning the homework in on time and if the school had a afterschool club this it homework wouldnt be a problem .

In conclusion this club would be really good to have because homework is a big issue in alot of these schools and most students dont care or dont understand how much homework matters it matters so much you probly wonder",0

From the point the im seeing the situation i dont think in those societies are giving, them a good reason for them to simmit a career,to the student because they are choosing the career for the students and they not letting them to follow a career, that they like because in school they are selecting the classes for the students ,that they are going to follow for only one specific career, and for the age ,that they have i dont think thats a good idea to summit a career because ,you have time to choose what king of career you want to follow and by taking classes for a career that you want and having the time ,and then you think your ready you can summit a career , because what they doing in the school is choosing what the student is going to be went he grows up.

They not letting the student to select there classes that are going to help then in the future for a career , in the school that they going they are selecting the classes ,for the students they not helping them , what they doing is ,that they are giving classes for only one career , and i dont think that they should summit acareer because, they not choosing a career that they want tey are choosing a career, that they giving to them with the classes that they making them have, so student dont have the much career to folow they taking whatever they giving to them.

in conclusion im not agree with what they doing with the student and they still not on the age to summit careers , went they get to the point at school is went you star looking for a career and what you like and what is making you follow the career and i would say ,that if u still in school it dont matter but the school they cant choose what you going to be you have to chose what you going to do and what you like the most and follow your dreams not what others say the you can do do or what you can be you have decide what you going to do the school is to teach you not to chose who you going to be.",0

"Dear Principal of Generic_School:

The change of the menu at the cafeteria might be a good idea but also might be a bad idea for some students, the idea to have a new menu at the cafeteria should be made it first in a debate with all the students at the auditorium, students can have the right to vote if they would like to have a new menu at the cafeteria, they might give a vote for which kind of food can be remove and which kind of food should to stay, or they can decide if will be better to not make a change at the cafeteria, making this plan will not have any impact in students or school to choose they food or making a change because they will have the opportunity to decide what is good and what is not good for them.

Making this plan, students will feel comfortable to decide good things for their school, students can also share ideas with you and make different plans for a good change at the cafeteria, just think about it and you will see good results in students of your school.

If students decide to have a different menu of food...

""This might be a great idea for student to try different kind of food and make this change every year, the good thing about making this is that student will not feel tired for be eating the same kind of food every year.""

""Students will feel excited every day to go to the cafeteria and see the new menu of food at the cafeteria.""

""Some students might have a favorite food but they can try different varieties of food and have new favorite food.""

""Also will be a great idea to give 35 minutes of lunch instead of 25 minutes, students can share time with them friends, have more time to finish if they have any work class or homework to do.""

""Students can enjoy the free time to eat with no rush. Making a change will be an idea that all might students they'll support it."",

I hope you consider this idea as a good idea and students may consider it this as a good idea too, also think about the good change that you can make for students to have better time at school and enjoying they lunch will be great to fill they energy and get back to class.

Sincerely:

Students at Generic_School",0
"For example, it is possible that one can be taken advantage of if they are always eager to help due to their positive attitude. Furthermore, jealousy can stem from one’s positivity if others have a negative attitude and cannot accept success achieved by someone else.

While hard work is also essential to achieving success, it is important to note that having the right mindset also plays a major role. Additionally, having a positive attitude can often lead to gaining favor from others, making it easier to achieve goals.

However, there can be negative outcomes from having a positive attitude as well. Research shows that having a positive attitude can lead to tangible benefits, such as making a good impression on those around you and inspiring those around you to also be positive. 
One of the most important factors in achieving success in life is having a positive attitude. Ultimately, a positive attitude can make a huge difference in how successful one is not only in their career but in life overall.. It has been found that those with a strong work ethic combined with a positive attitude have a much better chance of succeeding in life",1
"People that eats healthier tend to be more active and optimistic like my family.

My mom has been a great example to my family. Eating healthy helped us reduce our expenses by a lot.     . It wiil be used to start a company.

Some people think that eating healthier doesn't get you anything but, they are wrong because, healthy food gives more nutrient than junk food. she gets on time to her job and has more time for me.

Although, my family eats healthier, not everybody keeps their diet. Do you think is a good idea to change the school lunch menu for something healthier? In this essays, I will argue how a healthier lunch menu can improve students diet and make them more secure of themselves. All the money that we used to spend on junk food has been going to an index fund, that will be used once we finish highschool. In the future, I hope that the school change the lunch menu, so we can have a healthy and active life. My uncle was the second one that started eating healthier but, it has not shown any results out of his diet because, he eats junk food before he gets home. In the world, healthy people have been very successful. this behavior has make his more fat and lazy.

Moreover, when my family started eating healthy, we stopted expending in junk food. ever since, sher started eating healthier we have seen a big change in ther",0
"I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good.. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.

This change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both. Principal

This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement",0
"This, in turn, can lead to increased amounts of homework and less time to do it in. 

When students are asked to join a club or participate in certain activities, it can impede their ability to focus on their schoolwork. Trying to balance an extra-curricular activity with their usual course of study can be taxing and puts students under tremendous stress. The increased strain on a student’s academic schedule and the strain of anxiety and fatigue can negatively affect a student’s education. 

It is often argued that schools should make students join extra-curricular activities, but this can have a damaging effect on students. Making students join extracurricular activities increases homework burdens and leads to a heightened level of fatigue and stress. This can lead to poorer academic results, as well as mental and physical health issues. 

In addition to the increased homework, students may also experience increased levels of fatigue and stress. 

With all these factors in mind, principals should not make students join extra-curricular activities. This ultimately leaves them with less time to spend on their academic courses and can lead to substandard work. It is up to the students to decide if they would like to join an extra-curricular activity, not the school.",1
"If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related.

However noeveryone agree. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen.

In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. Thomas Jefferson said. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things

Finally, be related everyday this is something special.  . For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something ""I need to struggle.""

Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. But he always said this words ""one day everything is going to change."" He never stop to belived that. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. But you can get all this if you work hard and. Because you always are looking for something more than one. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things",0

You should always be yourself nobody should ever tell u how to carry yourself. My uncle got caught smuggling narcotics and is praying everyday he gets out. I may have a bad background but that was me trying to be somebody im not, I was trying to fit in with the bullies, wiith the kids who used to bully me.

Moral of the story is don't let nobody get to you and make you into something your not. I never got the chance to get the shoes I wanted or the clothes so other kids who were on the football team would bully me. You ever heard of the quote,""Don't judge a book by its cover?'' I honestly believe in that. I was going through it because I was tired of people bullying me, I was tired of people emberrassing me infront of other kids.

By the time I tried to get a job,all they woud do was look at me head to toe and say they arent looking for employees right now even though their was a help wanted sign out front. Even my moms friends would judge me on my looks just because I have tattoos and have a mean mugging face. This all happened because he was trying to be someone he wasn't.

To conclude, A couple misedemenors and felonies can ruin your entire life. Don't be someone your not, Be yourself.. I was once a scrawny kid getting bullied cause of the way I carried myself and dressed. I wish I could go back and prevent myself into being someone whom im not.

"It can make the difference between giving up and pushing through. This means that having enthusiasm for something can make others more likely to help us achieve our goals. 
Enthusiasm plays a major role in achieving success in all aspects of life. As the old saying goes, “Where there’s a will there’s a way.” This is why it’s so important to stay passionate, no matter what life throws at us.

Without enthusiasm, we become easily discouraged. Furthermore, enthusiasm is an important tool to help us over come difficult times and stay positive. We may give up too easily in the face of challenges, or tell ourselves that things are too hard. No matter what happens, knowing that we have the enthusiasm to keep moving forward is empowering.

Ultimately, enthusiasm is key to achieving our goals. It is said that enthusiasm is contagious and attracts the same level of enthusiasm from others. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” This emphasizes the importance of forming the right habits and having the right attitude in order to reach our goals.

In addition, being enthusiastic also boosts our confidence. This is why it’s important to remember that enthusiasm is a major influence on our motivation. Our enthusiasm is what will drive us to never give up and eventually reach our goals.. It is the foundation we use to make progress and move forward, even when faced with failure. As the great philosopher Aristotle once said, “We are what we repeatedly do. We should never give up in the face of failure, and instead, embrace the challenges that come with pursuing success",1
"

On the other hand, having a negative attitude can be damaging not only to the attitude holder but to those around them. Appearing positive can open doors to better career options, allowing for professional and personal growth. It can lead to increased motivation to become successful, as well as creating a better impression on those important people that will help further your career. Poor attitudes can lead to reduced productivity and bad decisions, negatively impacting the quality of people’s lives and their potential for career success.

After comparing positive and negative attitudes, it is clear that having a positive attitude is the most beneficial choice when it comes to achieving personal and professional goals. It has been shown that people with a positive outlook on their current situation are more likely to explore new possibilities that can lead to rewarding new experiences or opportunities. Therefore, it is important to maintain a positive attitude whenever possible in order to maximize potential opportunities and create more successful outcomes.. 
Having a positive attitude in life can bring significant benefits, from helping to motivate yourself to helping make a good impression on potential employers and important people",1
"We are now able to connect with people all over the world with technologies such as email, text messaging, video calls, and social media. Increased screen time can lead to physical inactivity, poor sleep quality, eye strain, and obesity.

On the other hand, there are also some negative effects associated with technology. It has had both positive and negative effects on people's lives. 

One of the most positive effects of technology is improved communication. Ultimately, it is up to us to use technology responsibly and ensure that it is having a positive effect on our lives.. 
Technology has been incorporated into our daily lives and has changed how we live, work, communicate, and interact. We are also able to work remotely from home, which has increased our levels of productivity and connected us to job opportunities that may not have previously been available.

"That was really hard for me, because i was new here and, i didn't know. And doesn't have benefit. I took my online class. If i need to take online class in future. Because in normal class, there is a teacher, students and a lots of things to they can make class very easy for students. And some times student can not have good attend in class, and that can make student to drop the class.

As wall as online class and conferencing class are the hardest classes. I think ""taking online class is not a good idea and it, doesn't have any benefit for students"". they need some body to pust them in class.

in,

june 7,2017. It is very different; when we are in normal class or we are in online class. Some of students asking for online class they think ""we can do it, but it is not too easy"". How i need to do my works? So that wasn't fun. I will always try to have communication with my teacher.                                                . when there is no teacher in class to help students, and some of students are too lazy. But nothing is impossible in this life we can do it "" with hard work and with a good attend in our class"". And some times online class make students to skip

, because when they face to face with a problom. Because teacher is the only person to can help the student on that class. And i was new in USA. Because the class was boring for me and very day works became alot so, unfortunately i drop my class. And i didn't get any thing from that class. And have a lots of benenfits, but in online class there is noting of these stuff are in online class. I used to have online class, and

"When i said community project like write an article about the company. Local work places like a store and business. Student don't have to work there for like 9 hours insensate they will work to hour a day. when you have a bad grade you will not be able to play game and use your phone. If the work fro along period of time they will have an headache because they are not use to it. What if the student did dome thing wrong there parent have to pay for it or the school.                 . Student shouldn't work it will make them get a bad grade. Also help out is like if they need wood the students will give them.

One way i think student should not work in a company is because the side effect is student wouldn't do their home work , they will not attend in class on time and they will not study at home. If the machine cost 10000 that is expensive to afford. Many school have partnership with local companies and organization allow student to do there community project and just to help out",0
"Being positive helps a person stay motivated, gives them the courage to take risks, and leads them to greater opportunities. With a positive attitude, everyone has the potential to achieve incredible things.. 
Having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on success in life. Having a positive outlook also helps a person to maintain an optimistic and resilient frame of mind when facing obstacles. With a positive attitude, a person can realize their ambitions and go farther than with a negative one. By contrast, those with a negative attitude will often get stuck in a cycle of pessimism and negative-mindedness, resulting in stagnation and lack of progress.

The reason I would go to France is to have the knowledge to be able to tell someone about how it changes you and how it's like and different temperature like how the country is to going to change on bad temperature their might just a small amount of people outside. On a good day there is going to a people are walking around having fun. You also try to see if the people their nice or mean to other people.

"We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Life doesn't for that way. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school.. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do.

Imagination is an invaluable tool that ought to be used in tandem with knowledge to uncover creativity and greater understanding of the world. A good example of this is Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone – something he thought of while contemplating ways to send multiple telegraph messages at the same time. Rather than being limited to a mere collection of facts, imagination helps to create new pathways for exploration that reflect our individual perspectives. Our ability to “daydream” unlocks potential for new and exciting ideas, theories, and inventions.  Letting our imaginations run free can take us places our knowledge might never have us go.. For example, think of the many inventions and advances in science or art that have been made not out of methodical analysis or study – but instead out of imagination and creativity",1
"This last body or body 3 is conneted in body 1 and body 2 this is the most important reason. Every body need imagination and knowledges to do what they want and both of these is fun like they can make things, they work as a team, and it will be at there rest of there life. if your working as a team and battling a robot battle you use imagination to think whats the best robot to build and how to make it stronger, that one of the examples. Then he said this "" imagination is more important than knowledge."" I disagree because you see you use imagination and knowledge in the rest of your life, when you work as a team you use imagination and knowledge and you need to be fast, strong, and smart, and imagination and knowledge is important. Both imagination and knowledge, you have those things from your rest of your life!!! Starting when you were a kid and when you grow older you still use both imagination and knowledge, thats one of my important reason why i disagree.

Second, you use imagination and knowledge when you work with somebody or working as a team, making something or thing how can we make it stronger or how can we win. If there's no imagination there's no knowledges, both of does is important every one need imagination and knowledge.

That's all my reason why i disagree that ""imagination is more important than knowledge"" both of those is important, you use it by playing, making, thinking, and more, that's all i have to say that i disagree on albert eintein.. I DISAGREE

Hello there!!! do you know that Albet Einstein is one of the smartest person that ever live, he discover by using knowledge and imagination. For example by thinking, to brain strom, to make music and more, is the same thing however you use knowledge with imagination. If you play sports you use knowlege to think what to do, how to win, its the same but you use knowledge. However theres a battle that you work as ateam, using imagination and knowledge, it is a war!!! let me explain its beacause you use imagination to know whats the plan, what is the things were using and knowledge to know when to attack , that one of my reason, when using imagination and knowledge in a team you need to be fast, strong, and smart.

The last one, imagination and knowledge is important, because imagination and knowledge is both important because if kids can't imagine theres no knowledge or if there no knowledge there no imagination. OK' let me explain why i disagree what Albert Einstein said.

First, when you was a kid you use imagination to make things, to draw, to make discoveres, and to have fun. When you grow older you will get knowledges and use it to pass your test, do your homework, and more, but you use your imagination too",0
"We all dose mistake in our life . he make me feel so bad about my grade, self so called my friend because i thought she will feel bad like me but she was so happy and she didnt care about her grade.

"Even though we may be able to connect with others superficially, without the ability to be our true selves, we cannot form meaningful relationships or grow in our career. 
When people are not accepted for who they truly are, it has a devastating impact on interpersonal relationships and professional success. It is clear that authentic acceptance of our true selves is fundamental to healthy relationships and professional success.. My own experience shows that when I have hidden my true identity, my relationships have been superficial and I have been unable to reach my full potential in the workplace. Similarly, Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" acknowledges the struggle many of us face when we are unable to be accepted for who we truly are",1
"Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But there are way more instruments than just the piano.

A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. Such as Smooth jazz, Rock, Orchestra, Rap and much more. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use.

There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud.

The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960's for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts.

But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. Pianos requires a great amount of practice and knowing all the keys to create a good music at a play with the audience amused. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. For example, A piano is used for many types of music. These three types of guitars are very different and attracts people's taste of music because some people are different.. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity",0
"Students with a positive attitude are more likely to be self-confident, organized and motivated individuals, which can be key in helping them reach their goals. It is also important to respond to events in an appropriate negative attitude when needed, so as to set healthy boundaries and foster mutual respect.

In conclusion, attitude is an important charisma for success in life as it impacts our actions, outlook, and decisions. 

In the workplace, attitude is key in order to create and maintain successful professional relationships. Attitude is an important charisma as it shapes our actions, outlook and decisions, which consequently affects how our peers and the world around us perceive us. It can be seen in the workplace, school, and at home, and is key in creating a safe and positive atmosphere for those around us. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for succeeding in life. People in the workplace with a negative attitude can affect morale, job performance and overall company culture. Positive attitudes create an atmosphere of trust, understanding and support. 

School is another area in life where attitude is particularly important, as it can determine how successful a student is. Employers value people who have a positive attitude as they are more likely to have better communication skills, open to new ideas and cope better with stress. As such, cultivating a positive attitude is essential to personal and professional success in life.. Students that are motivated and engaged in activities not only get better grades but also build strong relationships with their teachers, mentors, and peers.

At home, attitude is also important for maintaining relationships with family and friends",1
"To illustrate this idea, we can consider the example of Steve Jobs: an ambitious man who sought to revolutionize the world of technology. His words have a powerful resonance in our present day, for it is clear that those who act on their dreams and goals can achieve far more than those who do not. 

In conclusion, it is undeniably true that individuals who have an active ambition to strive towards their goals will become more successful than those who do not, as stated by Thomas Jefferson. 

When examining individuals who actively strive to reach their ambitions, the key component is the clear focus on their objectives. Those who do not have a clear focus do not tend to be willing to make sacrifices or take risks to push themselves further. He did not simply wait for his goals to come to fruition; instead, he was actively involved in every step of the creation process, from in-depth market research to detailed product testing and design.

In contrast, there are those who fail to reach their dreams because they do not strive to actively pursue their goals. Achieving one’s ambitions does not come easy, and for those willing to work hard, the rewards can be great.. 
Thomas Jefferson once famously declared that “nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude"". To put it simply: having an active attitude of determination and ambition can truly bring success. For example, many aspiring entrepreneurs will not risk their financial security in order to invest in their ideas, as they are not motivated to work towards their dreams. They will create tangible plans, allowing them to establish deadlines and strides in reaching their goals",1

"My other talent is hoola-hooping with my arms, just making circles with my arms for the movement of the hoola-hoop. Everyone can do anything, Imagine going to America's got talent and seeing people's talents and skills. My other skill is running fast, I use my legs and ball up my fist for more movement. My least favorite talent is hoola-hooping with my arms because it's not really impressive anymore.

In conclusion, now I believe that everyone has a talent and skill. I am identifying a talent or skill I have, and explaining how i develop and use it.

To begin with my talent, my talent is roaring like a lion, is like a deep voice and just pushing air in my throat. My final skill is holding my breathe long, it's risky but I would beat my friend's scores.

Finally both of my skill and talent, my favorite talent is roaring because I would scare my friends and it's funny. I am identifying a skill i have using specific details and examples.. My favorite skill is swimming fast because I can possibly beat anyone's scores. Everyone has a talent or skill. Don't be afraid to share your talent, embrace it and share it to the world. My final talent is drawing, i enjoy drawing because i can draw what i'm feeling but i need to be more detailed.

Next my skill, my skill is swimming fast, I only use my arms and legs for more movement and i would need a lot of energy for it",0

"While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well",0
"    . many people wont believe you're a good person just because you say you are. Another thing is always set good example when you're out in public with a family member, because if you dont people will not like that and have your family at fault.

in conclusion to all this if you show good behavior or set a good example by showing it , It will not only make people assume you're a good person it will also influence young ones to do the same. However, if you show them by how you act like for an example: you don't bother anyone, you show where a location is or try to, being polite, patience, showing manners, etc.

they will find you setting a good example or showing good behavior. In my opinion setting a good example is the only way to influence people you're a good person. same goes to people dont show them a bad behavior or example, thats not gonna get you anywhere, that'll only make people not like you and assume different things. Not only setting a good example can make people say you're a good person , it can also lead to ""good karma"".

Lets say you have a younger sibling, and they want to be like you , you can be smart , responsible,and a good behaving person, show them a good example so they can be as successful as you",0
"that's why sports are made because people can have fun without fight, and one more thing it can be is to go with friends to see movies or to watch soccer games or basket ball games or volleyball i don't know but there are a lot of ways to get to know someone, in my way i think that everything got a solution for the problems the problem is that we don't our respect to other people if we do it everthing it would be really different

Everything that we want is to be safe in a place where no gangstars are bbecause they only know how to make peolpe get more poor of what they are we should get involve all the families to try to destroy the people that are hurting others, alot of people try to study their best to be someone in their life they just want to get out their families out of trouble, out of bad ways, they can make alot of money easier when they finished ther school, only with high school finish you can get a nice job not a job that you would like it but you can get at least something.

People can be safe having their things like if someone try to take all that you had they just can go the police and tell them what happens and they might help them and they might help to try to recover what they lose people shouldn't be scared because when they show that they are scared other people can be smart and do a lot of things to thm just because they show sacared and all that we are people really smart but we sould be smart in everything because not because we are smart in some things it means that other people can be nice with you if you don't show angrily other people angry can hurt you in one way that it's going to hurt you a lot.

All people are nice but when they get angry or mad they change a lot they can be reall angry and you can be scared of how they can get, but for not having problems with someone you should just invite them to play sports somewhere or to have fun with your friends you'll can go to the beach and have a lot of fun there so the people can not get angry and it can get to be your friends forever or at least only friends, but no one should show their debil point because when you get a problem with your friends they would aready know what's the point that you would mostly hurt that's hy i think no one should know the most imporant debil point of your body or of you so this is my prompt thanks                                                   . I wrote a prompt to determine one thta people made bullyng to, it is really wonderful how people change when they know you, I did a lot to try to be fine with other people's,but not everybody is nice there are still some people to make bullyng or watever to you, they just don't try to meet the people they just perjudice the people without knowing them that's why i am always alone because to much people talk a lot of someone and i really don't like that the people be talking things about others and that the people that are the one's that are threat with bullyng they don't even say anithing of sacared of those people they think they can make bullyng to them.

I always try not to take care of what other people say they can talk whatever they want is their problem but when someone come's and they don't like that they can get hurt and there is when they look for you when they are in trouble, when i am angry or sad i just like to play soccer because that helps me to forget the problemsm that i got in my mind, if could it do something.

i would it try to make games of soccer so all the people that want to play soccer can get to do it and they can forgot their problems too",0
"We learn not to give up and chase our dreams. Hilary Clinton, soccer players, people in the government everyone had failed once in their life time. For example, when I was 13 I had to take a test in order to get in to the high school that I wanted but, the test was hard and I failed the test i said I will not take it again because it is hard and I can't do it but my sister said that i can't give up and I have to take it again and again and finally I pass the test for the second time.

Moreover, it teaches us to be patient. We never know when is the best time to do something or to get something so be patient. When we do same thing over again it makes our work easier. We are humans we make mistakes and we fail.

Failure without loss of enthusiasm is the best thing people can do. my parent told me that""good things will come to you just be patient""

Although, after failing once most of the people lose hope and stop trying. For example when we fail the test at school and we have to retake it we already know what mistake we did for the test so we do not repeat it. We learn how to be patient and deal with problems. We learn to be patient and chase our dreams. Clearly we will get what we want sooner or later after trying hard.

Overall, failure is a key to success. This shows that we will try harder when we get the chance to do it again. . Clearly we will be successful next time.

Furthermore, we learn not to give up when we fail for the first time. This shows that we are going to be successful next time. The best thing we can do is to be happy and joyful even after failing. For instance, we can make a whole new plan and ways to do our work. Everyone is not complete. We gain experience by failing. It is not something to be ashamed of.

In conclusion, gaining experience is the gift of failing. Everything has it's own time so be patient. We will not get to success if we do not fail once. obviously, it will take time to start all over and do everything one by one but it will help us to learn how to be patient and to deal with problems better than before. We start working hard and not to give up. Giving up is not the best thing to do after failing. when we fail it is the best thing for us to wait for the good time to start over and to get what we want. Nevertheless, it is not easy to start over because it gets boring working on same thing over and over and people give up on their dreams.

To begin, failing help people to gain more experience",0
"Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience.

Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control.

The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you don't have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now.

I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling don't show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable.

The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation,

for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if I'm dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments.                . Is almos all the time happiness",0
"Everything we have in earth is because imagination happened. its something you're born with not something you learn. Those people think ""what do we need, what can help me."" First you gotta imagine it, then you have to believe, and finally you do it.

Imagination is fun just let it take you where ever you want. You can make your brain think whatever you want you control it. You have it with you, you just need to let it shine. With imagination you can believe anything, new ideas are made with imagination, imagination is fun.

You can believe anything you want with imagination. You want to believe your touching a teddy bear, than you just imagine it and feel it. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Just do it and keep imaging, you imagination can take you anywhere you want.. Something not real but you see it no one else can see your imagination. What is imagination? Its something you imagine for example an imaginary friend. Some people just have a bigger imagination then us but we all think unique. Just image anything. Our imagination is in our brains with us it's something you're born with something only you can see it, feel it, and only you can imagine it.

Ideas happen because of imagination you can think of new ideas for a movie or anything. When you were a kid you had imagination it was with you when you were born, knowledge you have to learn. Knowledge is something you know, imagination is anything you want to see. Take vantage of it.

That's why i think Imagination is more important then knowledge. Don't be afraid to show your imagination",0
"For example if you have a baby, you can take care of you baby, and they the classes olnine at home. Also, if you need to go to work, you can go to work and in your free time take the classes online. Take classes Online can help busy students, but is you are interested in take this classes can help you too. By taken classes online they can make a better sketch, eat at home, do the homework, have more time to do the things that they need to do at home. Also, if they are in a normal school and they want to keep learning by the summer they easily can take the classes online or the video conferencing. Another reason is that some students live far away from the school, and they do not have a car or transportation, is more easy for them to take the classes online in the comfort of their home. Take classes online is a good opcion for busy people because some times they do not have enough time to make food, do the homework and go to school, sometimes they need money so they need to work, and they look at this like an obstacle that keep them away from school. In my opinion I think that the classes online or the video conferencing can a lot of students, if they are busy or if they are interented in this classes they can take it too.",0
"If we look back at examples in history, there is a clear correlation between taking action and reaching success. 

Opposing this view, some may argue that taking action is not the sure-fire way to reach success. Not only did she become the first African-American billionaire, she also created many platforms to help empower women around the world. Examining successful individuals is a great way to illustrate this point. 
The idea of always striving to do something in order to improve one's life is a widely accepted view that is here to stay. Furthermore, if we look at our own lives, any time we took action we moved closer towards our goals. Those who do not take action at some point in their lives and instead choose to sit and wait for something to happen are much less likely to reach success. Sitting and waiting for something to happen will almost never lead to success; rather, taking action as consistently as possible is much more likely to bring us closer to reaching our goals.. This is, however, an incorrect view to take. Whether in school, at work, or even in sports, we can identify times when we moved closer to success because of action.

In conclusion, the idea of taking action in order to reach success is valid, and it is proved time and time again by history and our personal experiences. For example, Oprah Winfrey grew up with little opportunity and faced immense poverty growing up; however, she pursued every opportunity she had, and became one of the most successful individuals in the world",1
"Growing up, I was exposed to a number of medical professionals in my community who inspired me to pursue medicine as a career. It would help me to learn more about the ever-evolving medical field and new technologies, while at the same time invest in the future of healthcare by educating the next generation. 
 My interest in the medical field began at an early age. I believe that partnering with the next generation to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration would be useful for both sides. I cherish the knowledge I have learned and am driven to pass it onto the next generation. By providing mentorship, I hope to not only facilitate the learning of the new generation of medical professionals but also inspire others to pursue their dreams and ambitions.",1
"Planning for a future career helps students to stay motivated and focused in their academic pursuits.

When high school students are thinking about their future careers they become more engaged and invested in their academic studies. Young people are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available, but articulating the path they want to pursue after high school can make it easier to decide what type of school to attend or even whether to attend college at all. By running career paths by friends, teachers or mentors they can gain helpful advice as to what paths might best lead to their aspirations.

Anxiety about the future may lead to procrastination, but planning for a future career is an essential part of being a high school student. Thinking about their future career gives students the motivation they need to stay engaged and focus on their academic goals. Despite the anxiety, it is important for high school students to begin investing in their future career. Knowing that they are working towards a specific goal that they are passionate about is what regularly drives students to excel in their classes.

Considering their future career can also provide a better understanding of their educational options. For these reasons it is important for high school students to start thinking about their future career.. 
The world of work is constantly changing, and uncertain job markets can make it intimidating for high school students to even think about their future. It is less about knowing exactly what you want to do and more about setting a goal. Focusing on a future career endeavor gives them the motivation they need to aim for higher goals, challenge themselves academically and learn skills that will be beneficial to them in their future careers. It can also provide clarity regarding their educational options and create opportunities for advice from teachers, mentors or peers",1
"Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them.

Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences.    . For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. All in all, it is a good thing to put a curfew because teens would have more time to spent with their family and doing good stuff for the environment. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew.

In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit. The city council should adoption the 10 p. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Should the city council adoption the curfew of a 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work.

To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. And it would help the environment around them and it would give more time and focus to the young people. m weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers?

You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things.

Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives",0
one examples that you get better learning in school and the teacher help you understand the work. second online school is tell you how to do the work and you have to find it out for yourself. You will learn better in school then online school. . I think that school is better because it teach you how to do the work and the teacher helps you on the work. online school is not good is because it didn't teach you and you might not know how to do the work for the class for online. School is better learn because the teacher are there for you if you need to talk to them or to get help in the work or to get more lesson and they give you a lot of time on work and give you time on the test and gets you ready for the sol. you might ask people for help when you don't know how to do the work when your at school the teacher teach you how to do the work and gets you all the help you in class and and afer school too so you can get more help on the work and the missing work and wok and if you don't understand the lesson. i think it not good for students because it didn't help students learn and you have to do the work by self . you could ask your teacher for help and be ready for test and the sol,0
"Finally, setting a good example for others can not only help influence their goals, but also help them to internalize healthy habits and patterns that can ultimately lead to a more positive and successful future. As evidenced by these examples, having the right influences in one's life can have long-reaching implications and be incredibly beneficial, even on a global scale.. Having friends with similar interests allows for collaboration and support when it comes to achieving goals.

Smart decisions, friends with similar interests, and good examples for others all have the potential to shape one's future goals and successes. Making smart decisions, especially as it relates to one's future, can be incredibly beneficial",1

"If you are a negative person then you should get some help or go talk to someone help. You won't be upset thinking "" did i do this right "" or "" am i good enough "". Don't let yourself get to a negstive stage beacuse you won't be anvoidable to accomplish your dream.

In life being a negavtive person isn't a good solution if you to be success in life. People have said ""positive attitude is the key to success in life"". It's give you happiness and make life easier. They won't be giving up on their self. For example"" you can't do this"" or "" just give up on life"" . You gotta bring yourself up when feeling down. You will have the best confidence you need to rech your goal.

be a positive person,and at least try to bring yourself up when you have negative mindset. you won't have enough confidence to accomlished your goal.                   . A negative attitude won't get you no where. So, you can become a better positive person.

A positive attitude help you to be something in the future. Also, without giving yourself hope you will get no where in your life. when you a positive person ; people would want to be around you. A person with a negative mindset would have bed thought in their mind. Also, with a psitive mindset you will want to keep trying unitl you make it. I belive without being positve a person would be depressed or being negative about their self.

I belive if you want to be successful in life you gotta belive in yourself. I competely agree with the statement because the person would have a positive mindset even going through hard time in their life. I understand that sometime life problem can be difficult, but you gotta keep being positive",0
"Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other but there was no help. I agree with him because, we all have a specific dream or mission we want to accomplish and every dream or mission have a standard end point on less you expecting something far more better than what you are having or where you are at that particular time or moment.

Taking myself as an example or personal experienced person,I had always wanted to be a model when I was kid which I still want to be, but one thing have noticed is that you can't do anything on your own without sometimes you need help from people around you. Am now living with my mom and step dad so they the ones providing for me; I don't work,I can't buy personal stuff and that makes me feel bad ,it makes me feel like am not doing anything in this world. Sometimes people even want to take advantage of that to use for their satisfaction(sexually) even though I know that is bad I still wanted to do it because of the goals I have set for myself .

But then I got to realize I have to wait for the right time to come else people will take advantage of me. Sitting idle will never let me grow until I do something better for myself.

In my opinion we have to set a goal for ourselves at a certain point so that we won't rush or stuck in between things , and also not everybody or anybody have to master things before they take a step and things work out for them well, some even have experience from childhood.. If I had never mastered it wouldn't have any experienced and would have never grow because I thought it was easy.

Life haven't be easy after loosing my dad some years ago,used to have a lot of plans in the nearest future with my dad. Was planning on graduating and buying a big house for us when I find myself a good job, but since I lost him everything just shattered and i don't know what to do",0
"people that don't do nice thing don't get treaed the same way . people need to more act of kindness in school when i was in 5th and 6th with the same teacher all we did was do act of kindness because she wanted us to see that just a note to someone you care or love about can make you and the person feel better than they alredy where.. you can see that when they where kid they where nice and kind but they grow up and they think that they can do bad thing and do not help people that need it or saying soming nice to them, but ever one has a diffrent ways of being them self and finding ways to not be nice or kind to others that are nice to them adn they don't want to do the sma e that want to be the mean one thae one that does not care what other think or do and try to hide from the fear that they can get in troble for doing this that are not to be seen or done at school , at home or even outside where you can get in to big troble . that why people that dont do act of kindness need to starr now so they know what it feels like to be good or just saying somethnig nice is good to but when you put time to it that is better to. maybe people dont see that nice people get treated better vs. people need to help other and respet each other everone has a good side to them even if they say they don't . I think that a act of kindnees is great for people to see that there are people that are nice and can do nice things",0
"For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we don't talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. People love doing their favorites things where it will keep them safe and healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesn't give you any bad day or anything like obviously you don't want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you haven't been. It's important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so that's why you should go outside and play with your friends.

In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesn't give you a stress. I just couldn't focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed.

To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. I didn't have any stress after in 2016. There a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. it's important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so that's the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends.

In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy.           . I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me",0
"These include reduced costs and environmental damage, improved public health, and increased reliability of the energy supply.

At the same time, there are some disadvantages to conserving energy and resources. Examples of such plans include providing incentives for energy-efficient appliances and vehicles, incentivizing renewable energy production, and encouraging public transportation. 
As the threat of global warming becomes more imminent, it is increasingly important to find ways to conserve energy and resources. One of the most significant is that the transition away from traditional energy sources can be challenging and costly. Doing so can help reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. In addition, government regulations and other initiatives may result in higher costs for businesses and consumers in the short term.

To effectively conserve energy and resources, it is essential to have a plan. Together, these measures will help ensure we have a sustainable energy and resource system for the future.. This plan should incorporate existing and emerging technologies, as well as economic and political factors. It should strive to reduce waste and promote energy efficiency. In addition, it is important to promote education about the importance of conserving energy and resources throughout the population. There are numerous benefits associated with conserving energy and resources",1
"For example, Generic_Name dating her best friend boyfriend secretly. hurting them more when you lie to them then be hundred percent honest with that person. In my opinion i agree honesty is the best policy sometimes, however, honesty might hurt a person's feelings because the quality of being truthfulness is the key through out life. so these are my main reasons to support why i agree with this old proverb says honesty is the best policy. so i feel like if you do these things i least own up to your problems by being honest by saying you did this or this happened. if you don't be honest life will make you feel stressful by hiding all these things your hiding from people so you do not wanna hide anything from the people u love or care for.

In conclusion, no one questioned the honesty of the judge's statement. Also, people will say bad names to you like your all lies, your not trustworthy, and your dishonest so if you don't want anyone in this world to call you these names be honest at all times.

Then, being careful and saying sorry to the things u told people that was a lie instead of being dishonest changing that honesty i say that people start thinking your real and wanna be friends with you. For that reason to support my answer your being trustworthy is better than done or obtained without lying to that person. you could break there hearts by not telling them somethings if the situations important that they most know. so if u do these things it could change you as what type person your now then back then and it will change how people act towards you or behind your back most of the times.

Next, not hiding anything frank from people. sometimes you could end up in bad situations and problems. . instead those people out there hating you and talking behind your back almost everyday. like you don't wanna hide anything from the people you love or care for you always wanna be honest with them no matter what. so that why i believe honesty is the best policy sometimes even if u might hurt a person feelings.

First, not stealing, cheating because people will not have respect and lose trust for you",0
"It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Another example is having a meeting for a job. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too",0
"Again, I can finish my school works quickly and take other courses which can help me in my future career or, may be I can do some other activities I like.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. Again, if I'm not at home or may be I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes.

Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. Last week, I had a math test on my first period. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class.

However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. Not only it will save our time but also it can give us opportunity to do a lot of extra activities and enjoy the day.. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. I was tired and tensed. One example is that, if I don't need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. Online classes can help us in many ways. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

Those who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons.

They say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class",0
"In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.

When students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. When I am older , I want to be at least a little happy with what I have my career as.

In the other sides opinion, I do see why committing to a career at a young age is pretty important too. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it . There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. They do not like going to work as much. . Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different . It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future.

Students still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now?

Many people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age. But many might not go for that career in the future . But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age.

I see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school",0
"Also you can do classes later in the day in case you want to work in the morning instead of the night. So you wont be stressed out as much that (study shows most kids that drop out is because they are being stressed out with so many info in just one day for like 4 different blocks in a single day). So you can have a career and have time to study to make your future come closer. Its a better thing to have online classes doesn't take up half of your day you dont get overwhelmed with new info for like 4 different classes in one day. It's also a good thing for people that have to stay home to look at after their sick parents or little brothers they won't have to worry at school if they are okay because they will be home taking classes and making sure everything is okay while studying.

Therefore they won't be overwhelmed about missing days or which classes he needs to make up a test or if he/she has a project coming up in class because all of that info is going to be in his/her phone or laptop. So i support the idea of distance learning for students and that schools are thinking about doing it would be a great idea.. I support thus idea of distance classes Because you can wake up anytime you want, Go in a slow speed to no overwhelm yourself, no one can bother you while you study.

First of you can wake up anytime you want so you can have the right amount of hours in case you work at night and you dont get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Online classes are better from what i heard it help's you better cause it teaches you what the state want's you to know instead of things you dont need to know like some side stories that teachers say to make you try to remember but end up getting lost in the story.

Finally when you do your work no one can bother you about the answer or what problem you in and they cant cheat off of you and you end up getting in trouble because they didnt stop asking or taking to you. thats why Online classes are more proffered then actual class when you have to wake up early and go to school all tired cause you only slept a little staying up because of work or studding for the next unit so you cant fall behind or re doing a new untie while going into a new one. Its also a good thing because if you don't understand you can go back a lesson to relearn it again in case you forgot how to do the problem. With online or video conferencing . Some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend class from home",0
"In movies of sci-fi the director imagine a space full of flying cars and gas stations in the space, one great example was in the movie ""Return to the future 2"" the director and the writer of the movie imagine a skateboard that could elevate one ore two inches from the floor and they put it in the movie, and now scientist invented a skateboard that can elevate four centimeters from the floor.

First of all, whiteout imagination the world couldn't be the same like we know it right know,the imagination can help to improve your knowledge. "" Imagination is more important than knowledge ""

Can imagination be more important than knowledge?

I think that imagination can be more important than knowledge. For example: i meet a partner that was depressed, i tell him ""i know how you are going to be happy, imagine you and the people you love to be near are in a vacation, then imagine you are whit out problems, whit out school, whit out homework,etc. Due to the imagination of some scientists have created a massive number of inventions that benefit almost all the people of the world in that part is when knowledge is created based in imagination. Now i think now you are willing to be without stress or difficulties in these day"", he told me he was better.

Finally, I think and many people does is that whit out imagination we couldn live happy and whit a lot of fun, knowledge is a part of the bast world of imagination. For example: I was in a project of a debate of countries, my team was N.Korea, i needed to imagine if i where in Generic_City presenting my statement to all affiliated countries of UN, so i began to write, i though i was going to lose, because my enemy was the Westerns powers, but then we could win due i could imagine if the situation was like i where a person of N.Korea speaking to orders governments.

Third, imagination makes you feel better, when you are bored or when you are sad, the imagination always can make you appear a smile in your face. People famous and normal people are successful by the imagination they use in theres life.. Think about that a world whit geometrical forms like squares or rectangles, horrible! For example: Bill gates was a normal person, studying in a normal university, and whit a normal family. You use it in projects, you use it in homework, also you use it in tests (Like me right now). But one day he imagine how to improve his knowledge of school of the systems of computers, then he invented windows, so thats is a great example o how imagination can change the world.

Also, the imagination can help people work",0
"Take, for example, the case of Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. It can help an individual see the situation or problem from several different angles and provide them with a well-rounded perspective. This approach has helped him make wise decisions and drive growing success for his organization. Since then, he has continued to gather multiple opinions as he navigates the challenges of running a successful automotive brand. When launching the company, Musk sought the collective input of over a hundred of colleagues and advisors before finally deciding where to take the company. 

Real-life examples of this concept abound. Additionally, having access to different points of view can help people to stay motivated in their pursuit of the best possible solution. 

Overall, seeking multiple opinions can be an invaluable resource for decision-making and advice-seeking, allowing individuals to remain motivated and choose the right option.. 
Seeking multiple opinions can be a powerful tool for making decisions and receiving advice",1
"However, homeschooling also comes with some disadvantages, including a lack of social interaction, fewer learning opportunities outside of the home, and limited access to subject material and resources. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is clear that homeschooling is a viable option for many families and can have a positive impact on student development.. It is important for parents to evaluate the pros and cons of both systems and decide which is best for their child. This is due, in part, to the lack of distractions in the home environment and the ability to learn at a pace that suits each individual. 

Another factor to consider is the effect of homeschooling on student stress. However, there can also be drawbacks to homeschooling, such as feeling isolated or not having access to external support systems. 

Overall, both traditional and homeschooling can be beneficial to students if designed properly. 
Homeschooling has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many parents turning to this option as an alternative to traditional public schooling. Proponents of homeschooling point to several advantages over traditional schooling, including a student-centered learning environment, greater flexibility, more personalized academic resources, and lower stress levels. Studies have found that homeschooling can reduce anxiety as well as disruptive behaviors in students",1
"

Ultimately, the decision to graduate early should be an informed one. While these solutions can save time and money, there are drawbacks to consider. 

An increasingly popular option for some students is to graduate three years by taking online classes or night school. Students should consider all the available options and research, in detail, the potential benefits and drawbacks. However, some students who have graduated early via these programs struggle with college studies because they have not had the same level of instruction or time to adjust to a college learning environment as their four-year-graduating peers. Furthermore, it is unclear if the credits earned during these courses will be accepted in four-year colleges and universities, and the level of instruction received in these settings may not fully prepare students for college-level academics. 
Graduating from high school in three years instead of four can be beneficial for certain high school students, but it is not without its drawbacks. Ultimately, the success or failure of graduation early will depend on the level of personal dedication and the kind of support the student has.. For instance, district high schools offer special programs to help students accelerate their coursework and graduate early. For instance, the online courses may be more difficult than regular classes and the night school may prove to be a challenge with a busy schedule",1
"For does that when they were in the school have some problems. That give opportunity for the people with low income. The people that can afford their school. and is a very good experience. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.

Next another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. And spend more time with them.

In conclusion the distance learning education is a very good idea in my opinion. Finally the distance education is a good ideas because help people with the things they want and that they need too. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. because have an education is important for this country and for all the people that want a good life and better opportunities of work.    . And also the people that does not have their family in this country. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.

Also another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And also finished the school he or she can get a better job and be able to be with their kids. With that the people who is trying to finished the school can be prepare to have better opportunities of work. If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example

Some of the students have kids and have to take care of them.

Another reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.

Also the family of the students can not affords the students education.

The person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.

I think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. because the people that can not go to school because they have kids or the teenager that have a pregnancy when they were on the school. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.

First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. And can be productive for the people who does not have a work because they did not finish the school. Classes in online is good for does that need to finish the school. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. The people who work and study and does not have the time to go to a regular school. And with that they prepare for the future.

The last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now they're trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids. I think that it a good that some schools offer distance learning for the students because some of them can't go to the regular schools and some of them are not able to finished one school and the distance learning offer a good idea for them. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. And don't leave their kids with another person many time. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Also is a good benefit for those that there time is not long as they want. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that want to overcome. The people of the distance learning have good opportunity for their future",0
"By building self-confidence, fostering quality relationships, and encouraging persistence, a positive attitude can help individuals reach their goals.. Builds Self-Confidence: Having a positive attitude gives individuals a strong sense of self-confidence. For example, an individual with a positive attitude may feel empowered to take on new tasks or challenges they previously avoided. For example, an individual with a positive attitude may be more open to receiving feedback on their work and in turn, be able to develop and maintain strong relationships with those they interact with. For example, an individual with a positive attitude may be more likely to seek out solutions and resources to help them push through difficult times. 

2. 

3. Encourages Persistence: Having a positive attitude towards obstacles and challenges encourages individuals to persist and not give up, even when the going gets tough. 

Overall, having a positive attitude is an important factor in achieving success. Here are three ways a positive attitude can help an individual succeed: 

1. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success. Fosters Quality Relationships: A positive attitude helps to foster quality relationships with peers and mentors. It not only helps to focus on the present but also keeps individuals motivated and energized to work toward their goals",1
"For those needing last-minute credits, distance learning provides the flexibility to take classes outside of traditional school hours. 
Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for high school students, offering a variety of benefits. For students with jobs, distance learning allows them to complete school work around their work schedule, meaning they can manage both without feeling overwhelmed. 

Furthermore, distance learning can provide more time for homework, rest, job-related activities, and visiting other places. With the right resources and support, distance learning can give students the opportunity to develop their skills and fulfill their ambitions.. Not only that, but distance learning can also open up opportunities for students to gain knowledge and experience in topics they may not have been exposed to while in a regular school setting. Additionally, for students with physical or psychological disabilities, distance learning provides the ideal learning environment that caters to their individual needs. This means that students may have more access to more specialized courses that may help them achieve their educational and professional goals",1
"However, a shorter school week could mean that students would have less time to learn in class, potentially leading to a disruption in their academic progress.. On one hand, extending school days means that a school can do more to conserve energy as they can turn off certain lights or air conditioners earlier each day. Furthermore, it could give students more time to practice energy conservation habits such as recycling, reducing water usage, and the unplugging of electronics when not in use. This would in turn reduce emissions and the amount of energy needed for those transport vehicles. On the other hand, adopting a four day school week could help reduce the amount of energy needed to transport students, as fewer buses and cars would be necessary. 
Extending school days or adopting a four day school week can be a viable way for schools to promote conserving energy and resources",1
"my character trait at the school can be a happy or serious caracter trait. for example If I use the same character trait from my friend to my customers my customer can feel bad.    . for example when I am in clases I am serious but when I am with my friend in lunch my character trait is happy.

In conclution my character trait is how I desided to make it. my brothe character trait is to lied everydoby at home.

In my house I can choose my character trait with my action",0
"
I decided to research Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space. I chose this project to learn more about her incredible achievements and to explore the various kinds of science experiments and projects that space exploration inspired. Jemison used her knowledge to shape her journey into space. To do this, I plan to mix baking soda, vinegar, dish detergent and a few other household materials with alginate and observe the reaction.

To ensure the success of my project, I created a checklist of items that will be necessary for the experiment: 
- Baking Soda 
- Vinegar
- Liquid Dish Detergent
- Liquid Alginate
- Balloon
- Bowls 
- Measuring containers

This project will help me gain a better understanding of how zero gravity works and how Dr. It will also give me the opportunity to explore science experiments and hopefully inspire others to do the same.. 

As part of my project, I'm going to attempt an experiment to create something bubble-like to illustrate the idea of zero gravity",1

"We become more efficient and tend to be more responsible for our lifes, it pushes us forward to our destinations in a good way.

Experiencing lets us learn more. For example, The successful people are always willing to spend times and put efforts in their work. The more we experience, the more valuable and proficent we will be.

While some people believe that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. Gaining perspectives makes us be aware of what we can do in the future. It also gives us advantages when we encounter difficult things and try to deal with it. For example, We learn from books and documentaries about what other people have experienced or doing different things by ourselves then gain perspectives from it. Most of us are very busy to achieve our goals in life. In history, a lot of leaders showed us that success comes from keeping doing and trying things over and over to make it what it is today.

When we become deligent, we spend our time doing meaningful things. We all live with purpose, finding a nice job, having a big house, or traveling all over the world. It shows us the passions. we should keep doing things and learning knowledges for the better us.. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" We accomplish more if we are always doing something.

Deligence leads us to a road of success. Other argue that inactivity also serve a purpose, for example, They say that we only live once, why give ourselves such hardtimes and do not do things that make us feel comfortable and happy. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""

Determine never to be idle ... The more we experience, the more successful we will become. Deligence makes us have a positive attitude to put efforts in our works, we can become more responsible for ourselves. Although this may be true, it will just makes us lazy and does not give our lifes meanings and purposes.

We will accomplish more if we are always doing somthings. Those things make us talented and gives us guides about how things might be when we grow up",0
"We may not be able to physically materialize our imaginations in the same way we can facts, but we can use them to explore new ideas that would otherwise be off-limits. 
Imagination is a powerful tool that can elevate us beyond the limits of knowledge and what is already known. Through imagining what life would be like in different situations and scenarios, I developed a better understanding of various contexts and the implications of the decisions I have made. As we continue to explore the capabilities of our imagination, the possibilities will continue to multiply and open up new paths that may have previously seemed out of reach.. Having an imagination has also enabled me to think of ideas for movies, seasonal decorations, and physical products that I otherwise would not have considered.

Ultimately, imagination is an invaluable asset that can make the seemingly impossible achievable; without it, we would never know the joy of discovering something that we did not expect or the satisfaction of having a unique solution to a problem. We can use imagination to bring joy, to create works of art and entertainment, and to spark innovative thinking that can produce groundbreaking products and inventions.

On a personal level, I have often used imagination to take a deeper look at the world around me",1
"It is a great way for the students to build up their future. By internships and shadowing we are getting right information directly from the employer without any difficulty.

In conclusion, students are getting a lot of information from the companies that have partnerships with the schools. Internships and shadowing allow student to know about different work environments before select the jobs. Studens are good on math work on computer programing,web designing, and computer engineering. Schools should have partnership with compamies because it helps students to get ideas about Work environment, work skills, and jods requirement

The partnerships with companies and schools allow student to know waht kind of skills need for different jobs. With these information student get a chance to prepair themselve. On the other hand, students with internships activities already had began to grow their occupation. People may say that job requirements can be find out in online, but often we get the wrong information from online. Some people like to work individually while other like to work with group. Also, in a recent report says that we accomplish more when we work in a favorable environment.

All jobs have some requirments. Students without internships activities take time to select the work that they want to grow up. They are heading toward in college as well as their jobs.

Work environment is very importent. Employers give us the opportunity to work and to overcome different financial problems. The informations help students to be successfull in their career life.. They meet the requirement before their high school graduation. Then students can find out their strong points and select the jobs according to their skills. Many high schools have partnerships with companies that help student to know about different jobs and companies. Different people like different work environment. We have to work to survive. Some companies have internships and shadowing opportunities that helps student to find out their interest. Some people may say people adjust themselves with the work environment but the question is how long time it will take a person to adjust with the environment?. Some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. All the jobs do not have same requirements. We should select the job that attends our demands. They suffer to select their jobs. Internships and shadowing opportunities help students to get these information from the employers. This opportunities gave students ideas about jobs they should select",0
"Our parents have experienced life and it's challenges and which they would want the best for us and nothing else. You are not gonna get what you want if you dont get up and handle it yourself.

I look up to my older brother because he moved out with a goal and that goal was to own his own car, his own apartment by the age of twenty one and still going to school part time. SO YES i think people should make their own decisions in life because its your life do what ever your heart desires!                      . Should people make their own decision ? or should people seek for guidance ? I think you should live your life the way you want to live it with the guidance of your parents because they already lived theirs. But thats not the point, the point is that he left my parents house with a goal, determination, and self trust he always told me that its all about taking risky decisions in life.

Nobody cant make you do anything but yourself the only person that can harm you is yourself the decisions you make in life will impact yourself. For example you are looking to purchase a car, you would ask your parents for their thoughts and guidance because they have already been there done that. I aspire to be like him so hard working and with a goal to do it all by himself with the guidance of my parents of course. Or be someone a person can look up too, be motivation for someone else be someone you want to be in life. But its not just gonna be handed to you you have to work for it there are always gonna be obsticals in the way or challenges in the way but you have to tell your self to just keep swimming. You decide what is right or wrong in the real world because outside of high school its a whole different ball game you are gonna make bad decisions and good decisions but its okay mistakes will happen and mistakes are good because you will be able to learn from them and grow as a whole. Deciding what you would want to be in life, Now thats a choice you choose on your own, you choose if you want to be successful in life, you choose if you wanna have a big house, a nice car, a good job thats all you from what i've learn in life is that nothing is gonna be done by it's self. i think mistakes are a blessing because i know that my parents both made mistakes and some a regretful and some are a blessing that you will learn and live to tell on.

I think it's important to have something or someone to inspire you to motivate you have to trust your own gut because you can always look up to them",0
"
Though first impressions can tell you a lot about a person, they have the potential to be misleading. I had heard rumors that she was a wild party girl, so I expected her to be loud and obnoxious when I met her. I remember when I first met my best friend. No matter how many facts a person may be presented with, first impressions are often the most powerful influence.. 

Though first impressions can heavily influence the opinion you form of a person, I believe that an opinion can change as you get to know someone better. When I got to know my best friend better, I was able to see her true personality and appreciate her kindness and intelligence.

However, first impressions are usually hard to change. Once someone forms an opinion of another person, it is difficult to persuade them to think differently. However, she was actually quite shy and sweet. After spending more time with her and getting to know her, I found out that she was actually more of a homebody than a party person",1
" . Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework",0

"We believe that making healthier choices easier for students can have a lasting impact on their physical and mental health. We could also look at introducing more vegetarian and vegan options to the menu, as these can be both healthy and delicious. 

Making these necessary changes to our school's menu will benefit our students in the long run, as it will give them the opportunity to make healthier food choices that will help them to stay healthy, active and focused. We suggest replacing the unhealthy items on the menu with a range of fresh, healthy options that are both more affordable and healthier for our students. 
As the Principal of our school, it is your responsibility to ensure that the health and wellbeing of our students is being taken seriously. 

Two of the major issues with the current school menu are the lack of fresh, nutritious options and the high cost of these meals. 

Studies have shown that by offering healthier meals to children in school, it can lead to an increase in concentration, energy levels and overall health. We hope that you will consider our proposal and make the switch to a healthier school menu.. This could include a variety of fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables as well as lean protein sources. Unfortunately, the current school menu does not reflect this, with unhealthy options such as greasy fast food options being offered on a regular basis",1
"i'm not thinking to go out with a guy because girls you have to love yourself to be able to love other person.

In conclusion,if you are honest with yourself your life will be okay without any problem.     . One thing you don't ever forget is to be honest,and to be real with yourself and everyone around you.

Girls,if you reading this please don't make the same mistakes that i did in my past be always honest with your partnership or whoever, because the consequences are not how you might think. Girls,let me tell you my big mistake that i did,we talk about 5 months as a friend after we talk for 5 months he make me his girlfriend,at the time i was still feeling butterfly for him that first years is was perfect like any relationship,those 12 months i was so happy,i always told him that he was ''the love of my life'' and i just say it for everything we went trough since middle school also,because he was my first boyfriend and my parents were fine that i was dating him because they though he was a good person.

Girls,find a guy who is real with you all the time they might be a lot of guys out there that can pretend that he is in love with you. Let's be honest if you're yourself and not faking who you are in this world you'll become a better person in this world. When i was in 8th grade i met this person i was so in love with him,he add me on snapchat so that same day that he add me i post a pictures that i was in the field,35 minutes after he text me i was so happy,and nervous because i liked him so we start texting but we never talked in person,a week pass by and he start to being disrespectful with me,playing with my feelings i knew that we were just friends in those time. One day i told him that i want him to be honest with me,he always said that he was honest with me,2 week pass by he were keeping playing his little games and i did not say anything i just leave his message in delivered,1 years pass by he texted me saying that he felt so bad for everything he did to me in the past,i just told him everything that i felt for him in the past but he was not honest with me. after 5 months of going to therapy,i was able to talk him to close a chapter because i learn to forgive but in my heart i felt hate for him what i told him was ""i love you but i love other person more than you and that person i'ts me"" yes, he cried but he did not deserved me .Finally i let toxic people leave my life,i'm not going to lie like i'm afraid to talk a guy again because i feel they will hurt me. Yes, they might be real and make you feel butterfly 5 months or 6,but things changes in this life person change not everything is always the same,anyways he started to lie to me when i knew that truth of that problems is when he start to hurt me all the time but when you love someone you let them hurt you,so i keep letting him hurt me,i started crying and to supplicated to stop hurting me he stop like any relationship we were okay for a week and then he started doing things that hurt,he started talking to girls,and cheated on me but us girls we so dumb that we keep them.2 Years after i was in depression i did not tell my parents they found out when they take me to the hospital because i passed out in my room crying, without eating for days i was in the hospital for a week after that i was able to go they take me to therapy",0
"Additionally, students may not have to pay any extra fees for online courses, making the potential for savings great. In addition, a lack of face-to-face interaction with peers can make it difficult to ask questions and discuss ideas freely.. On the plus side, they provide flexible scheduling, allowing students to study and attend classes at times that work best for their individual lifestyle. For example, some courses may be more difficult to grasp without the help of an instructor present in the classroom. 

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks that come with online classes as well. Online classes also enable students to pursue their desired degree or certification without being physically present in a classroom. There may also be challenges that come with studying alone, as students must find motivation and stay organized to complete coursework. 
Online classes can be incredibly beneficial and can open up many opportunities to those who wish to pursue higher education",1
"Having an active life can also help us push ourselves to greater heights, and perserverance is key to achieving our goals and dreams. Activities are important in gaining knowledge and experiences, as well as building self-esteem and confidence. Additionally, the choices we make today can impact our outlook for the future. 
Staying active can be beneficial in helping us to accomplish our goals and dreams. What's more, the daily activities that we choose to engage in have a major role in shaping our lives. They help us develop crucial skills and provide meaningful relationships with others. As a result, it's important to stay active and make wise decisions in order to lead a successful life.",1
"

In conclusion, working in a team provides many benefits that cannot be gained working alone. Working with a diverse set of individuals can lead to better ideas, enhanced productivity, and improved team dynamics. Having diverse perspectives can help to create and develop innovative ideas and solutions. Being in a collaborative environment can encourage creativity, foster open communication, and provide an opportunity to mentor and learn from each other.

When working in a team, members’ different skills, experiences, and backgrounds can be applied to the task at hand. Working in a team also allows individuals to use their individual strengths to their advantage, creating a powerful combination to benefit the team.

Team work also promotes shared responsibility and understanding. Additionally, working in groups encourages members to become better listeners and communicators, which can improve not only the task at hand, but also relationships between team members. Therefore, the advantages of working together far outweigh the benefits of working alone.. When each individual in a team has a role to play, the risk of failure is reduced; if the task isn’t accomplished, the entire team will work together to find a solution. When tasks are shared and each individual does their part, amazing results can be achieved. Studies have shown that when individuals are part of a team, they are more likely to have better ideas and more efficient outcomes. 

Working in a team can be a beneficial endeavor for many reasons",1
"People tend to ask to other if the choices that they are making is the right one, but instead of asking others what they think the person has to be confidence in themselves that they are making the right choice. Another example is that, the person will prove to everyone that they are capable of achieving their dream, and that it is possible to get. A person knows what their interest are, so they choose according to what they like to do the most. This is why people should first plan their transaction then take action on it.

People have the free well to choose what they want to be and what is best for them. People can form their own character based on what they choose to make it. This is why people need to think about their choices before doing anything.

People can choose their own character and what they want to become in the future. Some may disagree with this because others may see that what they are choosing to do is not the best thing for them. On the other hand, if a person really wanted to become that person they will work intensively for it.

A persons character can be constructed by how they choose make it because they know the course that they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for themselves, and they know what they want to be in the future. For instance, if a student wants a good future they have to work hard and study in order to accomplish it, and not choose to go the wrong way. Furthermore, if a person finds a job that they really like and want to get it, they will work hard for it. However, people can determine their own character based on how they want it to be because they know what steps they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for them, and they know what they want to become in the future.

Knowing what steps to take will help the person make the right choice in defining their character. For example, If a person wants something badly, they will work persistently for it. For instance, they would have to focus and work hard in order to achieve their future selves. People should choose to make their own character because they will be comfortable with their choices.. A person is given the responsibility of choosing whether to do the good or bad thing. Others may say that people do not get to choose their own character because it is beyond their control. However, others may say that it is impossible to become what you dreamed to be in the future because they will face may opsticals in their lives. People could choose to became; artists, actors, singers, or doctors because they have dreamed of becoming one of these seen they were a child. For example, if a person hears that their friend is in a bad situation and then choosing to help them out, they are showing that they are capable of make their own character. On the other hand people may say that having a second opinion is a good thing, but that is wrong because it may cause them to doubt themselves",0
"I was happy to actually find two people that speak the same language as me but, that didnt last long because i never got to see them again. Thats how i learned to do things all on my own without help. next time try working on alone, in a quiet room. Teachers and students love to be in a quiet place because it helps them concentrate more than being in a group.

In conclusion working alone is better than working in groups. People say working in groups is better than working alone, but thats their opinion even though it helps others more than it helps other individual's. Till then i worked alone, avoiding others, sticking close to myself, even studying alone without anybody. Not everyone has a group to be in except for people that know each other , They have many people that wish to be in a group like them. In a quiet place, We'er able to finish other assighment's from our jobs or school work. It can be hard but, the reward is so worth it.

People say working alone has no distractions, finishing faster than others, or learning things on our own. . Finishing our work can easily be done without a group, like in our jobs, an office, or even at school. Other individual's say that having no distractions can help them work without stopping but, sometimes there are many difficult situations where we cant do much to work while being distracted, maybe being in quiet place may help. I still know working alone is better because all my life i've been working alone since sixth grade. That made things worse for me. I wasnt really the person to just jump in and meet others or ask for help when i needed them.

Every person has to go through many difficult times looking for a group but, Their just too shy or too nervous to say a word to other people, I would know because i was in the same problem. Back then when i was a little boy, I didnt know English so it was harder for me to understand teachers, or even students till i met two other kids that spoke the same language as me. My mother or father couldnt help me as much",0
"My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. Some students don't know or can't decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they don't even finish high school, but if they can't accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have.

In conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician; this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you don't expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job.

Basically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams.

This doesn't always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I don't have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. Some jobs like construction, and plumber don't require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they don't find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college.

I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. Some students don't have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job.

There are jobs that don't ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs don't really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didn't want to take advantage of that.

I would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me",0
"I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

Sencerly, YOUR S. Dear Principal,

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades",0
"and student's wont be able to get help on what they need help on. if we dont know how to do that subject the Teacher would have more time to go over it again and tell us step by step how to do it and help us to improve and get better at it.

Another good reason is because that extra hour can help us get better at the subject you dont like or can help you get better grades because the Teachers can show you how to do it and you won't struggle in test because the

Teacher reviewed it with you and it would benefit you because you would start getting better at it.

The extended hour can benefit the teachers a lot because it would give them more time for planning and doing stuff they need to do and what that extra hour we can make up all the work that we didn't finish.

The problem's if we do not get the extra hour is Teachers wont have time to get through their lesson because they wont have much time. and Teachers won't have to worry about not finishing their lesson because of how much time they have in that class.

I also believe that if we do extend the school day longer we would learn more because of the extra time we are getting. and it would give us more time to learn.        . Why i agree with the school board planning to add one and a half hours to school is because it would give us more time to learn in each of our classes and it would benefit everyone.

my reason for why i agree with the school boards planning to add one hour and a half is because if we are doing a worksheet or any notes and we dont finish the notes because of how less of a time we have in the class and with that that extra hour we can get some more time to finish work we need to finish.

Another reason why i think that would be a really good idea is because it would not only give us more time to finish and do work but it would also be very helpful to the teachers. because it would give them more time to teach us and finish things they need to do. another reason is that students will fall behind because they won't have much time to get through the subject they need to finish and they will have to finish the next day while other people will be finished with that subject.

These are my reasons why i would agree on the school extending the school day one hour and a half longer because it would benefit the students and the Teachers",0
"However, staying successful all the time comes with its own set of challenges. Success lies in achieving and maintaining it, while failure involves giving up or not being able to meet the standards of success. 
The importance of being successful in life versus being a failure depends on how an individual defines success. Even after failing, one can capitalize on past mistakes and become successful again by learning from them. Diligence, hard work, and dedication are the most important qualities needed in order to be successful. To prevent failing in life, one must set realistic goals and make sure to create a plan to achieve it. Additionally, one should be aware that complacency can lead to a downward spiral of failure. It can be difficult to remain humble and maintain that same level of success. Therefore, to remain successful, it is important to remain aware of one's surroundings and adjust according to new challenges.",1

"Making your own decisions can be both liberating and empowering since you are the sole responsible for the outcome. Taking risks without proper knowledge can also result in failures which in turn could lead to negative consequences. How the personal choices and decisions made today will affect or shape the future is another area of consideration. 
Every day, people make decisions about their lives and futures, sometimes without seeking expert guidance. 

On one hand, it can bring forth new ideas that may be more successful than relying on an expert. Each individual must weigh the merits and demerits and arrive at the best possible solution.. Coupled with a solid research, making your own decisions can be highly valuable and beneficial.

On the other hand, making decisions without expert guidance can also be a double-edged sword. Personal opinion can be a powerful influence as it can shape the choice and decision being made. 

Overall, making your own decisions has its pros and cons",1
"Finally, encourage readers that re-centering and recalibrating after failure is a normal part of life and essential for anyone seeking to reach their goals. Point out the detrimental mental, emotional, and physical effects of allowing the persistence of failure to cause someone to give up. Despite experiencing a multitude of failures early in his life, he refused to give in and kept pushing himself forward, ultimately becoming one of Britain's most legendary figures. Churchill was a British statesman most famously known for his leadership during WW2. A student is struggling to pass a difficult college course and has already failed the course four times. It would be easy for the student to become disheartened and give up, especially with the overwhelming challenge of preparing for and taking yet another exam. 
Sir Winston Churchill remains a powerful example of perseverance and success despite failure. Through researching the achievements of Winston Churchill and exploring a hypothetical scenario, it has become clear that the courage to continue despite failure is the only way to experience lasting success.. However, his successes as a politician did not come easy. 

To support not losing enthusiasm after failure, an essay should emphasize that life is full of challenges and how failure is inextricably linked to success. 

On a personal or professional level, it is important to remain consistent and not give up after failure. His famous quote, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”, emphasizes the importance of not giving up in the face of difficulty, instead persevering and striving for success.

To understand better how to continue striving in the face of repeated failure, let’s examine a hypothetical scenario. Remind readers that a success story is more than just endings and that the path to success is likely to be filled with setbacks. But that student must remember Churchill’s advice and take courage in the knowledge that failure can lead to success if it is met with dedication and consistency",1
"It can be beneficial to seek out advice from an expert in the field, as such advice often comes from the experience and research of a specialist. However, it is important to remember that no one is infallible, and that even experts and authorities make mistakes. Seeking out one’s own understanding of a situation and having the courage to make mistakes can help in making an informed decision. If an expert or authority does not have a complete understanding of a person’s life, then any advice they offer may lack accuracy and be incorrect. 
Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be a wise decision in many important matters in life - from medical advice to financial decisions. Therefore, the decision to seek advice from an expert should be made cautiously, regardless of the potential benefit.",1

Online classes have been increasingly popular as technology advances and the need for social distancing increases. Furthermore, several studies have shown that students tend to be less successful in passing online classes than in traditional classroom courses.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to taking online classes, there are also disadvantages to consider. It can be difficult for students to motivate themselves when there is no professor present and no regular deadlines and expectations. There are several advantages and disadvantages to taking courses online. Additionally, online classes make it easier for students to collaborate and communicate with one another in discussion forums or chat rooms. Online classes also often lack the personal connections and relationships that come from face-to-face instruction. One pro is that online classes can be taken at any time and from any location, making them more accessible to people who have difficulty attending a standard class. 

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to taking online classes. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to take online classes should be made on an individual basis, taking into account student engagement, difficulty of passing, and student-teacher relationships.. There is also evidence that online classes can foster student engagement as students are in control of when and how they access their education",1
"It is important to consider how this practice can help us to foster relationships and potentially increase understanding. 
In today's world, it is becoming more and more important to consider our identity in different situations. We can also look at the example of American secret service agents disguising themselves as Muslims. The concept of being ‘somebody else’ can be a useful tool in many aspects of life, such as accomplishing goals, avoiding conflicts, and even adapting to different environments.

For instance, in the political unrest between the current President Donald Trump and the Democrats, changing identities could help to increase understanding and foster relationships. 

Moreover, in everyday settings, changing identities could help us to adapt to different environments as it allows us to gain new experiences that can contribute to our personal growth or to reach our goals. For example, with the ability to become somebody else, we are able to open ourselves up to new possibilities and meet others with open minds.

As such, there are many benefits of being somebody else at times. This could be useful in diffusing dangerous situations, since they would be able to gain insights into the culture of the environment they are in and therefore be better equipped to handle and work around such conflicts. . We can use this to our advantage to reach our goals, avoid conflicts, and gain insights into different cultures and environments",1
"For one, those who are younger often have the capacity to learn faster, meaning that they can get ahead with their career preparations sooner. The mental and knowledge preparation that is a part of committing to a career at a young age is also one of its benefits, as they will have the time to explore different career options and become properly informed of what the job will entail. By committing to a career at a young age, students can ensure that they get the most out of their education and embark on the career path they have chosen with confidence.. On the other hand, students who don't want to commit to choosing a career at a young age may find themselves with a disadvantage later on; without having the time to find out what career they would ideally like, they may find themselves accepting jobs they don't want out of desperation. 
Committing to a career at a young age has many advantages",1

Older students can also offer support in a more subtle way, by simply being a positive influence in the school. Further, they can help younger students assess their strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to understand what subjects they excel in and may need extracurricular assistance in. They can take the time to explain topics that may be difficult to understand. 

In the end, older students have the power to be an essential asset to the younger students in their school. They can set a great example for the student body, demonstrating qualities such as respect and courtesy. From their experience, knowledge, and wisdom, they can provide support to those who are just starting out. Through mentorship, guidance, and a positive role model, they can help create a healthier and more supportive school environment for years to come.. These students can be mentors, helping to provide guidance when it comes to school and social matters.

"An individual could start a garden of their own and see the results come to life as they learn how to care and nurture the plants. Gardening is a great way to learn about plants, soil, and the environment. 
One activity that can be both enjoyable and educational is cooking. Learning about different ingredients, recipes, and cooking techniques is not only a great way to learn about nutrition, but can also be a fun and creative process. By studying a new language, you can learn about new cultures and even new words to use in conversations. It can even be fun to try out different planting strategies, such as companion planting, and to see the results for yourself.

Finally, learning a new language can be both enjoyable and educational. Plus, you can make it enjoyable by setting small and achievable goals and then rewarding yourself when you hit them.. For example, someone could make their own pizza from scratch - they can select from a variety of different toppings and sauces, experiment with different baking techniques, and taste the delicious results at the end.

A second activity that could be both enjoyable and educational is gardening. With the internet and so many apps and websites dedicated to language learning, learning a new language is more accessible than ever",1

Summer break is a common and much anticipated time for students, but it could also have its drawbacks. 

On the other hand, students who have difficulty with learning may struggle more without the regular schedule of school, and find it difficult to continue learning during their own time. Ultimately, it’s up to each student and their families to weigh the pros and cons of the different options and decide what solution best fits their particular needs and situation.. Additionally, students often get to spend more quality time with their families during this break. Additionally, lots of idle time during the summer may lead to students forgetting much of what they studied the previous year due to lack of practice. 

An alternative option to a long summer break would be to attend year-round school, which would provide students with a more consistent learning environment and prevent knowledge from fading over time. On the one hand, a long break can provide students with the opportunity to review the material they learned during the school year and even take summer school classes to make up any credits they need",1
"Without this real connection with people, it can become extremely easy for students to neglect their work, skip assignments, and procrastinate more than if they were physically in the classroom. Some schools in the United States should not offer online classes for their students because they could easily become a substitute for vital social interaction and can lead to a decrease in the overall quality of learning.

For many students, online classes remove the compelling motivation of being in contact with their teachers and peers. If students are used to exclusively taking classes online, it poses the risk of further isolating them from the world. By exclusively taking online classes, students miss out on learning skills such as public speaking, participating in group activities, and working collectively with peers. Schools in the United States should not offer online classes if it means compromising the quality of education and decreasing social interaction for their students.. Social interaction is a crucial part of learning, as well as a student's development. 
Online classes can be a useful way for students to receive an education, but they also come with risks that cannot be ignored. 

In conclusion, the potential risks that come with online classes are not worth the convenience. Without this condition of accountability, students are more likely to receive a sub-par education.

Furthermore, it is impossible to replicate the real-world experience from a computer",1
"In addition to the potential challenge of coordinating schedules and meeting times, other issues can arise, such as potential discrepancies between the amount of work each person contributes and the weight of each member's contribution. 

In conclusion, although working in an academic setting with a group can be beneficial in several ways, the potential issues within the group may outweigh any potential benefits in some cases.. By discussing tasks, researching topics, or completing tasks together, it can significantly increase the quality and efficiency of the work. 

However, there can be drawbacks to working in a group. For example, if working on a group project in an Introduction to Psychology class, different members can bring their unique viewpoints and perspectives, allowing the final project to be more comprehensive and creative than if one student had completed the project alone. 
Working in a group can be beneficial in an academic setting as it allows for increased collaboration, creativity, and new perspectives. This could lead to conflict and a less than ideal outcome. For example, if two people in a group are especially invested in a project, but the other two contribute little effort, the final result could be negatively impacted",1
"I learned some English, how to write it, and how to speak it, although I'm still learning it, but I keep going trying it without giving up, and the most important think is without losing the enthusiasm because if we want something, we need to keep going, and trying until we get it.

Some people think they can do it, and those people prefer to gave up, and NO! That's wrong. :). I didn't know any English, but I said to myself, ""I'm never giving up, until i get it"". You need to keep trying until you get what you want because that's the goal.

"First, if the students are in their houses they would have more distraction, for example; they can get distracted by the food, many time food is a big distraction for students to concentrate in classes. Some schools are considering the idea to offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home. Also one of the biggest distraction for everyone is the cellphone. I do not support this idea. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. They would not receive as much attention as they need.

However, many students support the idea for students to attend classes from home. using the online program would give them a big support.

In conclusion, considering the idea for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video can be a good or a bad idea for many students. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. Many students can benefit by considering this new idea for students to take classes from home by the way of online or videos. They would feel allow to do whatever they want because they would not have the rules like in a classroom. Sometime they have to walk or even pay so that they can go to school and attend to class. Many students do not have transport. Also, students will not take it seriously because there's not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. If the student is in a classroom; he/she receive more information, more examples, more attention, and more help. They would feel free because they are in their houses. Students should not attend to classes online or video. And third

They would not be able to learn as much as they would in a classroom. Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. And by considering this idea for students for students to attend classes from home would help them; because even if is raining or snowing, they will not cancel their classes. Second, they would not take it seriously. If a student is taking classes at home; no one would be responsible to tell him/she not to use their cellphones. Therefore, many students agree with this idea because is not only going to safe them time; it would also help many students. Students can get distracted easily by anything or anyone in their house. Also many times when there is a bad weather outside; many schools cancel classes; because they can't travel. Although, many other students would not be agree with this idea.

In my opinion, I am not agree with the idea for students to attend classes from home. Every teacher has rules in their classrooms; rules that help students to be successful. They would not be able to ask questions and get the answer they would need. It can be considered a good idea for many students; because they would not be traveling from one place to another; it would safe them time.      . It can also happen that watching a video and that there's no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. They can also get distract because of the television, they can see something interesting in the TV and they would quickly get distracted. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future. Sometimes they might take the classes; and sometimes they would not take them because no one would be telling them to do it",0
"just keep running and don't let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing.""

In general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesn't affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes it's a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you can't resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called ""Winston Churchill"" is right about ""success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with his opinoin.. We humans aren't really perfect, there hasn't been one human that has never made a mistake, for example the person that is writing this prompt, has had a decent amount of failures in his life. It's not a really easy job, but the pay is good, $50/hour, for a teenager that's a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they don't affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane.

Me failing makes me stronger, it's like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use %1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least %50 of it.

If you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, it's impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like i'm doing homework, pretending like i'm listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didn't want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and i'm making sure that i'm happy, more than anyone else, I'm not going to let any negativity impact my life.

My dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that ""imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you"", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that ""you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didn't seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didn't mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didn't care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School.

I will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldn't happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didn't know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me ""Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?"" and I said ""I'm sorry, I didn't know that i have to change my gloves every time."" he said ""It's fine, just change your gloves and make another salad."" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order.

By the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didn't know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesn't want to fail this senior year.

If he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesn't sound right, does it? i'm from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that ""my child is better than yours""",0
"With so many demands placed on young people, it can be difficult to know how to make their own decisions. 

These types of stories are reminders that we all have the ability to control our own lives. While she was aware that this could be a risky endeavor, Daisy chose to take a leap and make the decision that was right for her. No matter what outside influences come our way, it is ultimately our responsibility to make decisions that will help shape the future we want. 
One of the biggest struggles adolescents face is the feeling of being overwhelmed by their environment and the pressures placed upon them. 

Take for example, the story of Daisy, a high school freshman who felt pressured to pursue a career in medicine, like many of her peers. . However, despite these external influences, the power to decide one’s own future and path remains within each person’s control. Through her strength and courage, Daisy followed her own path and ultimately created the future she wanted for herself. Despite this, Daisy followed her true passions and decided to major in music instead. While we cannot always change our environment or the people around us, the power of decision is in our own hands",1

"I disagree that students should be required to take an arts as a class but as an elective they can choose between what type of art class that they want to take,for example if a student wants to take a music class as a elective they,ll have to check in with their counselor to see what class that they don,t need so that empty spot can be the elective that they have chosen.

Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists.               . drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous.

Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective .

Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective",0
"Technology had positives effects in people lives, it helps them in many ways like emergency, transport, and security.

Technology helps people in case of emergency, it helps them to comunicate with emergencies. In schools they use technology to teach student how our first genaration was, how they dress and how hard was to live in the time. Technology also helps with the traffic security, like lights in the road to see where are you going, see if the car infront of you stops, and cars have cameras to see when you are going back.

In conclusion technology had a great impact on peoples lieves, because it helps alot with transport, emergency, education and other. After school students can do their homework instead going to other places like in the pass.

Technology helps people with security, people use cameras to keep secure places. Also helps people in case of emergency, by taking them to the hospital. It helps keep people alive in the way to the hospital. if someone wants to travel to others country, they can take a airplane or a helicopter.

Technology helps people in education, teachers use technology to teach. People will have more avanced technology in the future. It helps doctors when they make an peration.

Technology helps people with transportation, people can travel around the country from place to place. People use transportation when they have to work. Student can find any information about projects in the internet. Also technology can help doctors, to determinate what is wrong with the patient. They use cameras in places like shopping store, food markets, restaurants and other places. ",0
"Finally, technology is good for communicates with other people that lives far away or other country.

Furthermore technology had good benefit for the people life and essential for young person, but no all people usable good for example, the young uses sometime only for play game or post ban things in social minded. First, technology is a systematic treatment of application of Knowles esp. Now is more easy to do things like; pay in online, reading book, communicates or other things now can do. In conclusion, technology has positive and negative effects on people's lives.. Sometime technology can be effects people because when the other people used social minded for make bullying to other person, this person can be effects emotionally.

In the past does not have technology; so was hard for communicates with other people, buy things from other country, or for to looking things for homework. technology increase each years because put new cellphone computer or other things like that. Now the company have good money because all people have cellphone or computer and the cellphone year to year they more expensive to buy. Now is more easy to communicate because the people have cellphone.

Now the time chances because technology increase more better and more easy to do things. Third, some people uses the technology for good things like "" people can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person."" This explains the technology is good and promote more easy lives of the people. So technology can be has positive effects on people's live, if the people can be use right the technology. Technology allows to the people, technology they has positive or negative effects on people's lives. My Mom and my Dad say "" in the past was hard to communicates because did't have technology (telephone,table,or computer) so before use letter to communicate with other person, but to take long time. Also, the technology sometimes can had negatives effects on people's lives because some people do ban things with technology for examples, cyber bullying, steal ID form other person, or to trick the young person. Second, technology is very important for some people because some need for job, communicates, homework, play online or other things. Also technology had negative effects on people's lives, if the people used technology for ban things",0
"If they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. If the persons cant think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something and they cant think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like.

In conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they dont want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think. In my thinking I would not like to someone choose for me because they dont know what I like, or what I dont like. The persons are going to have the freedom to choose what they want to do with there life. They should think for them self.

Having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they dont like, or want. I agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices.         . Having self reliance is a important key to success in life because self reliance is making your own efforts and decisions. For example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities dont like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. For example, they go to the lunch room and there is a lot of food there and they are trying to get something but they dont let them get what they want because they dont have the freedom to make there own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them.

Another reason is that the person can think for them self",0
"That's why imagination is more important than knowledge.

Furthermore, imagination can help you invent stuff like flying cars. If you can imagine something than you do it if you imagined it right. In knowledge it's like you knowing the answer to a math question or just about any question.

Finally, imagination makes the world a better place, how does imagination make the world a better place. I can use my imagination and and think about what can i do to build a flying car and boom! now you know how you can build it. If you dreamed about something, with your imagination you can accomplish that dream and make your life better, and maybe that dream was you becoming a teacher than you're making your life better and the world a better place.

To conclude, scientist Albert Einstein said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge ."" and here is why with imagination you can create in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it. Well it has a lot of reasons but the best reason is, it makes people happy if people are happy then there is no violence in the world. Your brain helps you imagine it right, for example in the game called Fortnite, you imagine what you want to build before you build it and how it's going to look like. Imagination is literary a image in your mind, its like you drawing the things you want to invent on a piece of paper, and just adding some colors to it. If we don't use our imagination there would be no light bulbs or nothing. In knowledge you just know it you can't make it more beautiful. Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree, why do I agree with scientist Albert Einstein. When you use your imagination,

you can create it in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it.

First, when you use imagination you create it in your mind, you can go to your happy place and just build it you see how it's. When you use imagination you can see the problems that might happen when you are trying to build something in your mind. You need imagination more than knowledge. I am not going to say you can't build flying cars with knowledge but, with imagination you can make it better. ",0
"Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school.

To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . Let's make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. Students needs time with friends and family. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools

In conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. . Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework.

In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. As you can see,

students could not have time to play and do their homework. But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country.

Yet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent",0
"It is also important to evaluate the pros and cons of working during high school, as this can be an effective way to prepare for adulthood but it can also impact the amount of time spent on serious academic work. 
Graduating early from high school is becoming increasingly more attainable. Further, it is worthwhile to investigate if there are any graduation policies in school related to a minimum GPA.. Another option to support the aim of graduating early is to bring up your GPA by taking extra classes, participating in sports, or switching courses with the help of your teachers. Students can take advantage of various resources, such as online classes, summer school, and staying after school for extra help, to gain a head start on their future",1
"We can learn lesson from tortoise and rabbit story. Now all of us what the result gonna come. Once it is gone it is gone for forever..So,the key point is we should understand the importance of time and utilize it properly and make it effective by always doing something which leads us to the accomplishment of our task.. It somehow can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng.

There is a famous saying that ""Rome was not built in a day"". I can support it by saying that failure will never ever take you if your determination towards success is strong enough and keep workng for it.

Let's take an example of two students. Slow and steady always wins the race but it doen't mean to say that doing work slowly will worth it everytime. Yes,we accomplish more if we are always doing something rather that doing inactivity. One student happily submitted the project accomplishing it before the due date and the other one had to suffer a lot. Would it have been possible if they were doing inactivity? Obvioulsy no nah? Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. We should always respect your competetors thinking that they are as stronger as you and keep doing our assesments to be the most deserving one of that victory. Our continious work to accomplish any task will be paid later by our better results. Here the people were always working for many years to built Rome into a beautiful city. So which one would you prefer accomplishing by always doing something in the right time or rushing to complete task in due time.

So,in my opinion always doing something to accompish more is better idea than thinking that inactivity also serve a purpose. As ""Where there is will there is the way"" in the same way if we really want something then we can achieve it if we keep on working and always do something for that. If we keep on doing something to accomplish it then victory is always near to us. From tortoise side,like topic says we should be always doing something to accomplish more or in time in the same way tortoise kept on walking for the race although he can't run having faith in himself that he can do it. We should have strong believe in ourselves that I can do it then nothing seems impossible.

In conclusion,last but the least I would like to end up saying that if we are always doing something then we can accomplish more compare to the one who works inactively. It somehow can can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. Time is the most important key factor in our life. I mean that you should be always doing something in oder to accomplish in time. Hard work and dedication always lead us towards the success so does if we are always doing something to accomplish the task. From rabbit side we shouldn't do mistake to think our competetors not strong enough than you. Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. We can see their hard work and dedication really worth it as it is one of the most beautiful city among the world. if two students are assigned a long project in the summer vacation and one student started working from the mean day so that it will be easier from him to complete before the due date whereas the other one kept on realxing thinking that he will start working on it at the last of vacation. No one want to rush to complete any task at the due time so we should be always doing somehing to accomplish more",0
"Hope that this information helped you so much and to figure out if you were stuck on which country you liked the most and where you want to travel..

"Instead of wasting his time being idle, Gates used his ambition and determination to create something meaningful with his time, and today his success serves as an example for others.

Those who are idle and think that inactivity serves a purpose are not only not determined to better their lives, but they are also not planning for the future. 

For instance, one individual who was determined not to be idle was Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard but still managed to create one of the most successful and recognizable technology companies in history. 
""Determine never to be idle"" is a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, and it is a valuable saying that resonates with today’s society, where it often feels like there is not enough time in the day for all we need to do. By actively pushing ourselves to use our time and resources to their fullest potential, we can boost our creativity, experiences, and futures.. This means that a lack of passion can lead to stunted intellectual growth and missed opportunities. How can we as a society apply this quote and reduce our collective idleness? By committing ourselves to utilizing every moment to the best of our abilities, we can ensure that our time and energy are being used in an effective and productive way",1
"For example, my mom would tell me life Is a lesson each day you will learn something different and you will get stronger so you don't know when and what will happen to you so mantle and physically be strong. It make's you more success In life, even helps you to learn a life lesson, that you can do much more then what you could image to build your life and happens.

When you did something and It makes you failure don't think that why did that happened, or why did you do that although, give up that you can't solve It, you should know and everyone else that we all are strong we will not know until failure comes to you that you are much stronger and be powerful with what you have and what come's to you

Nothing Is more Important then success your life, sometimes failures and make you life hard but It can make your life more powerful, that you will trust yourself and, It will make you stronger and you will take more responsibility for your next steps. For example, my father would tells me all the time that when you get older have your on business and you need to be strong If your not strong ""failures"" can heart you so that's why you need to work so hard and be strong as will to reach your goals. Although even If you have a good life don't think that's It that you will not have any problems anymore. On the other hand, failure Is good because they know how strong and powerful thy are and nothing can break you or failure you.

Being powerful and strong Is so Important so that life will change you no matter. However If you did something learn you mistake lesson to not do It again and forget the mistake.

However, It's not good to have failure some people can't handle It so they kill them self. How or why, so you should all ways learn your lesson that, why or how did failure In your success life and happiness never let anything come between you, because you will get stronger each time and better.. If you don't work hard and not be strong failure can make your life so harder

On the other hand, life is a lesson and challenge for everyone It can take a risk so you need to be strong for what ever come to you and be powerful for not any failures so to you and break you. Failure Is Success

Nothing can make you stronger then failure",0
"In between that John Lubbock shows he's made his own choices about this and you as the reader to think about it also and makes a choice. Because if all politician were the same and influence by each other every time they would all be the same and wouldnt have made their mark. People should have to make their own choices anyways because you cant work as a politician and always agree with what people say and be influence by it you have to make your own choices. I say we all choose are own characteristic traits because everyone has a option. In conclusion the way were based on the way we act or show who we are, for are traits . When John Lubbock wrote this prompt he took action to write it instead of be influence by others and becoming the same as them. For example: The British naturalist John Lubbock was sophisticated person as one his characteristics traits therefore he had the right to write and read when other didnt have the choice. When John Lubbock choose to become an politician , but also a naturalist which he chose to become one. Back then I havent known a lot of British politicians that were naturalist as John Lubbock but, until now because he made his mark. When it come to talking about what characteristic traits we have its based on the person who decided to become whoever they want to become and control their out come in life",0
"It provides an opportunity for them to learn important life skills while giving back to the communities in which they live. 
Yes, students should absolutely be encouraged to participate in community service. These are just a few of the many different activities students could choose to do to make a difference in their community.. Examples of activities students could do to benefit their community could include spending an afternoon at a local animal shelter playing with the animals, volunteering at a soup kitchen, helping to clean up a local park, running a literacy program, or collecting food for a food bank.

"He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to ""

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job",0
"For example, if they want pizza they just order it online or they saw a cute dress, but they didn't wanted to go to the store and buy it, they just order it online. It was fun to play with other people, people enjoyed it.                                . And they get it to their house, so they don't go all the way there.

In this generation, almost everyone stays at home because they just want to be alone watching Netflix or being in their cellular device. They are only worried about their social media for example, they only see how many likes, comments and followers they get. Now, if they want to be play with other people, they just download a game on their cell phones, computer or even on social media; now they have games too. Technology had people changed a lot during this generation. Also, about what people say about them in social media and if they get tag in a picture. If they do hangout they are only on their cellular devices and not socializing; that's mean to the person that they are hanging out. Technology, it may be a helpful tool, but it's also a distraction which affects adults and children. This is how people is now, they don't see the importance of talking to each other, they only want to know about what people say about them in social media.

People now does not want to go shopping stores anymore, which this means that stores are closing because of people buying everything online. I'm not saying it's a bad to have technology, what i'm saying is that now people don't hangout like they used to, they don't go shopping anymore now, they only want to be at home this is why, I considered a negative effect to people's lives.

Now almost teenagers, don't hangout with their friends anymore because they just can face time or call them without going out of their house. But, what i have seen technology is a negative effect on peoples life. This means that now, almost everybody are so into technology in certain way. This why it's not a good thing of having technology, because is keeping people away from the other people. Back then, people always went outside and play with their friends in the streets. Also, people used to go watch a movie or hangout at least, but now people stay at home because they can see the movies or playing videogames with other people online.

In conclusion, people don't hangout like they used to, they don't go shopping anymore, now they only want to be at home. Sometimes they even got the chance to meet more people. It's a distraction that's taking away from not talking to family, friends, etc. I get that people use technology because of their jobs, but for other people is a distraction. So buying everything on online is the new thing on technology, therefore people now doesn't need to go out to buy what they need, now people just can order it that's why, they are being more lazy",0
"No matter how big or small the goal might be, so long as I stay focused, stay determined, and work hard to make it happen, I know I can achieve greatness.. This experience taught me the power of hard work and determination. Not only did I save enough money for college, but I also gained valuable work experience and earned the admiration of my supervisors, who promoted me to a managerial position. It took hard work and dedication, but I eventually found a job as a cashier in a local grocery store. Despite the fact that it wasn't the most glamorous job, I showed up to work on time, hit my goals, and even worked extra shifts.

My hard work and determination paid off in the end. 
When I was in high school, I was determined to get a full-time job for the summer in order to save up money for college",1
"Studies show that healthier lunch menus have the potential to improve students' diets, security, and lifestyles, leading to significant improvements in their lives. It is clear that making such a shift to healthier options would be beneficial, and with the right policies and commitment, the positive effects could be achieved.. 

Overall, the change to more nutritious lunches in schools has the potential to have numerous benefits for students. 
In recent years, the need for a shift towards healthier food options in schools has been made clear. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that healthier lunch menus can provide students with better economic security, by encouraging them to purchase healthier options rather than relying on pre-packaged, processed meals. Studies also suggest that when students are provided with healthier meals, they are more likely to attend school, which could lead to better academic outcomes and improved student well-being. For example, raising awareness around healthier dietary options in students can instill healthy habits that could help prevent chronic health issues throughout their lifetime",1
" . In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen.

In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. But you can get all this if you work hard and. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. Thomas Jefferson said. Because you always are looking for something more than one. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different.

For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something ""I need to struggle.""

Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things

Finally, be related everyday this is something special. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. But he always said this words ""one day everything is going to change."" He never stop to belived that. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related.

However noeveryone agree. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it",0

In recent years, many high schools and education programs have been created with the aim of helping students find a career-oriented path and set them up for a successful future. Additionally, these schools and programs can also provide valuable connections and networking opportunities, which can be invaluable to young people seeking employment.. On the other hand, making a commitment to a particular career at a young age can limit a person’s options and be restrictive in terms of open exploration and research.

The greatest advantage of career-oriented programs and high schools is that it gives students the opportunity to better prepare for life after graduation. Having the structure and guidance to decide on a future career can give young people the tools they need to ensure a successful outcome. Making a commitment to a career at a young age can have some advantages and disadvantages.

On one hand, having a plan in place for what you want to do for a living can provide focus and drive for young students as they complete their high school studies. It allows them to explore potential career paths and gain experience and knowledge in their chosen field, which can dramatically increase their chances of finding a job and achieving their future goals",1
"School provides an array of experiences and lessons that cannot be taught outside of the classroom. With every educational opportunity, come a multitude of greater opportunities. 

The importance of attending school is inarguable and should not be taken lightly. Despite her determination to further her studies, she was met with a delayed success. Some students may struggle to stay focused due to the variety of distractions brought on by life outside of the classroom. For example, Samantha was unable to attend college due to the financial strain and having to become the primary provider for her household. In addition, formal schooling introduces students to a number of career pathways that can shape their educational and professional paths for years to come.

However, prioritizing school is not always a simple task. Although education does not guarantee the outcome, it does afford us the tools needed to take us one step closer to our eventual success.. Education helps to foster the development of necessary life skills such as problem solving, communication, and critical thinking. 
Attending school is a vital step in any individual's life and is imperative to achieving future success. Financial obligations, mental health issues and family responsibilities can take precedence and lead some students astray from their primary focus of attending school. Education serves as the explorer's map to success for the future",1
"Not only does this demonstrate their uniqueness, but it can also help them reach their goals and dreams in life. Ultimately, it is clear that interests and trends can heavily influence people and allow them to go further in life than if they were to simply follow what their peers do.. This can be largely attributed to the fact that when people choose activities or interests that they prefer, they are more motivated and energized to pursue them. Therefore, by indulging in such personal interests, people are able to pursue their goals better and with more focus. Plus, they often feel more connected to and passionate about the subject, which leads to more enthusiasm and effort in the long run. 
In today's society, it is increasingly common for individuals to follow their own interests and passions rather than following what their peers do",1
"So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us.

People do not need contact work together. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. It save many time and improve the work. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. We need cost more time. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. We can use the less time to do more work.

So that is why I think has the limtation of human contact due to the use of technongy had positive on people's live.. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. Technology

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. It is not a good things for us. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work",0
"they have been there and they have experienced everything so they know how it is. Its always good to make the decisions on your own. . I think it can go both ways people can make their own decision or they can seek guidance from experts, or authorities. There fore you dont need no seek guidance from other people.

People, who value self reliance is doing things on their own like homework,classwork,jobs but then they are talking about should they take guidance from experts, i would take guidance from experts because they know more. But its really their choice on what they want to do, it would be helpful to have an expert or authorities to help you with ideas.

People who make their own decisions on life important matters shouldnt need no help with decisions because they have it all planned out its called being responsible. I feel like doing everything on your own can be difficult and tirering and then you just feel like giving up.

In conclusion i think people should get ideas and help from experts and authorities just like i said before they have been there and they are more experienced and i feel like they can help you a lot with anything and help you be successful",0
"Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution you're supposed to get. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success.

First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time you're losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal.

In conclusion, some people said that failure doesn't lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldn't actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class.

Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life.

Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesn't actually goes the way you had planted. In the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success.. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success",0

The world is in dire need of renewable energy sources. This is critical because many areas of the world are experiencing water shortages. Fossil fuels create polluting by-products that damage the environment and human health, but renewable energy produces no such pollution. For instance, renewable energy is often “distributed” or generated at the point of use, creating jobs in rural and less developed areas. For these reasons, it should be the priority of governments and businesses to invest in renewable energy sources in order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create more sustainable forms of energy.. 

One major argument in favor of renewable energy stems from its clean energy production. 

In conclusion, renewable energy sources are clean, affordable, and offer numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits. Solar energy is now about as cheap as energy from fossil fuels, and in some parts of the world, it is even cheaper. By investing in renewable energy sources, governments and businesses can reduce their energy costs in the long run. 

Finally, renewable energy sources offer numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits. Renewable energy can help reduce emissions and tackle global warming. 

In addition to being clean, renewable energy sources are also affordable and have become increasingly so. With solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy, it is possible to phase out fossil fuels entirely and become completely dependent on renewable energy for electricity and transportation. It can also help countries increase their energy security, because they don’t rely on foreign energy sources so much. Wind energy is also an extremely clean source of energy, and both solar and wind energy have much lower carbon footprints than fossil fuels. Solar power, for instance, produces no emissions and its use in electric power plants doesn’t require water for cooling. Wind power is also much cheaper than solar power and is now competitive with natural gas. On the environmental side, renewable energy sources help mitigate climate change, reduce air pollution, and decrease the extraction of finite fossil fuels like coal and oil",1
"well a lot of kids dont care about what they eat only if its good. And Chips or other snacks shoudn't be taking away either mostly poeple like snacks more then food. Taking out the student favorite food shouldn't be taking out cause a lot of kids wont even come to school cause of the lunch and but if there different kinda food it would maybe make kids love lunch more. And something kids may not like the food from the beginning cause it may not be cooked right, or it may have the lunch lady hair in it, and lunch ladies should ware hair nets when they cook the food in the morning and after noon.

And this should be for the bananas too if they don't look good you should throw it away and some other food it are past days. . it would be better just too leave the food alone and let people enjoy it. its a really bad idea coming from the principal",0

Graduating from school is a tremendous accomplishment and one that should be celebrated. It also provides valuable socialization opportunities and the chance to make friends and acquaintances that can last a lifetime.

Ultimately, graduation is an important achievement and should be celebrated. School teaches us how to problem solve, how to think critically and how to interact with others in a professional setting. It can give you the skills and qualifications needed to start a successful career, and will open many doors of opportunity that might not be otherwise available.. Graduating from school requires hard work and dedication, and earning a diploma means that you have completed the coursework set by a particular school or institution.

Having a high school diploma, or even a higher degree, can open doors to job opportunities that might not have been available otherwise. It can bring many benefits, from the satisfaction of achieving a goal to having more opportunities for employment and continuing education. Many jobs require that you have a high school diploma or equivalent educational qualifications, and having a degree in a particular field of study can help to expand your career prospects even further.

"try to make your schedule early like in the mid day in the morning to go to your home early.

a lot of people kidnapped every day make sure you're safe. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. the council said the teenagers don't have to be in the street after 10 p. And also I saw before a guy have a gun and he stopped a girl and his husband and he took from them the all gold that girl have it and he took the wallet from the man. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. m. a lot of people dead because of the people is drank or the someone have a gun or knife. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. and they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. and if you don't care about yourself no someone will care about you keep yourself safe. The police doesn't want to control on you but he want to be safely. If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. that's mean is breaking the law. be in your home early to be safe. if the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and don't look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. I think this council is debating the adoption. That's tells you how the world is not safe. m. that warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. And also I was have my friend was in street at 1 a. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. your life is expensive don't make your life is free for someone.                                                                                                                    . if you search in internet about the people is succeed in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest",0

"While the limitation of physical contact between people may be considered a drawback of technology, it is not the only possible outcome. 

One distinct advantage to technology is that it reduces the amount of time needed to complete mundane tasks. Similarly, online banking services help people manage their finances faster through the convenience of automation. There are undeniable benefits to technological advancement, particularly in terms of reducing the amount of time needed to complete daily tasks and increasing our autonomy and convenience. 
In the modern world, technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives. 

Not only does technology reduce the time spent on tasks, it also provides greater autonomy and convenience to people's lives. With the help of smartphones and other devices, people can access a plethora of information, meaning they have access to a host of tools and knowledge at the touch of a button. By reducing the amount of time required to do certain tasks and providing greater autonomy and convenience, technology has the potential to make life easier and simpler for everyone.. For example, the introduction of automated machines has drastically reduced the amount of time needed to manufacture products. This makes tasks that would have otherwise been difficult or impossible not long ago significantly easier.

"We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. I think it is a good idea because students might be tired of working at school everyday. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. People might think that their family is annoying or they don't love them but your parents and siblings love you because we are not perfect in every way.. We can enjoy each other by going to a amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories. We must stay with our family because they love you so much and they want to spend time with you too.

Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We need to be together as a family, work as a team, having fun on a vacation. Lets say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round schools, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc...

First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. I love going to the pool in the summer because we don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat , go to mall, watch a movie etc...

In conclusion, We must spend time with family and friends to go anywhere in the world for a vacation. We need families to stay together as a group because if we don't then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone that's okay if you want.

Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc..",0
"Do you ever wonder if most students use their phones in school for educational purposes? In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music. When listening to music when you're working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldn't be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and that's why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then don't know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board.

Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages.

Most teachers don't allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyone's going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school it'll be easier for them to call you.

Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldn't have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed",0

"when people ask for advice, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by seeing if most peoples opinions are the same and its a good advice some opinions maybe better then others , you can also recave better advice from differnt people like your best friend can give you an advice that will help you lot but the other person that you dont really talk to that person doesnt really know how to help you like your best friend does , each opinion can help you with something different like some one may give you advice about a sport you may not need it right now but you could use it later in life so each opinion can help you later in life it may not help you never know , for example if you need advice on how to do better in school or how to get your grades up you would ask a teacher or your friends but someone else can give you bad advice or it doesnt helpe youor on how not to do well in school so its better to ask multiple peolpe then just one because you have a higher chance of getting good advice frome differnt people and you have more to opinions then just asking one persone beacse he may not have th best advice but he will try to help but you have a lower chand you can see wich helpe more and wich dont really dont helpe you would be getting good advice that will sadisfide you, so in my opinion asking multiple people for advice is better is a better chose then just asking one persone.",0
"By studying a new language, you can learn about new cultures and even new words to use in conversations. Gardening is a great way to learn about plants, soil, and the environment.

Learning about different ingredients, recipes, and cooking techniques is not only a great way to learn about nutrition, but can also be a fun and creative process. With the internet and so many apps and websites dedicated to language learning, learning a new language is more accessible than ever. For example, someone could make their own pizza from scratch - they can select from a variety of different toppings and sauces, experiment with different baking techniques, and taste the delicious results at the end.

A second activity that could be both enjoyable and educational is gardening. It can even be fun to try out different planting strategies, such as companion planting, and to see the results for yourself.

Therefore, the importance of imagination compared to knowledge cannot be underestimated. Imagination is the power of the human mind to conceive or create images and ideas that are not based on past experience, which makes it a fundamental tool for exploration, innovation and creativity. 

When we put these two concepts together, they become even more powerful. They are two sides of the same coin; one without the other would not be enough. Together, they offer the perfect balance between theoretical thinking and practical application, allowing for a greater level of understanding and progress.. Imagination allows us to think outside the box, to explore ideas that would otherwise be overlooked, and to find solutions to complex situations. Imagination can open up the door for knowledge to be used in creative ways, allowing us to develop new theories, solve problems, explore new possibilities and come up with innovative solutions. 
Imagination and knowledge are both essential components of human life and the development of our societies. It is this combination of imagination and knowledge that is essential to learning and development. At the same time, knowledge allows us to take our ideas and put them into practice in a tangible form. Knowledge, on the other hand, is the accumulation of facts, information and skills acquired through study, experience or teaching, allowing us to use this knowledge in a practical and meaningful way. 

Without imagination, knowledge would become dull and uninspiring as it would lack the freedom of thought needed to truly propel us forward",1
"Dear. Principal,

I think the best and awesome policy is policy number 1 , because the students need their cell phones to call their family members to pick them up. I see a lot of students use there phones in class, but maybe if you give them other free times to use it they may not use it during class periods. Having to use phones in your own free time is not a bad idea, but need to remember to turned off their phones in class.

"I knew it would require a lot of hard work and long hours to make it successful. Without doing hard work and having confidence, these people made false assumptions that the universe would simply line up and present them with a successful end-result. I was confident that I had the right skills and knowledge. After graduating college, I had a dream of starting my own business. 
When I look back on my life and evaluate how far I have come, I can confidently attribute my success to working hard, having confidence, and taking the initiative to do something to drive the results I wanted. It's better to put in the work than rely on the expectation of results without doing something to get more.. Unfortunately, these people often end up achieving nothing, as they never had any agency to try and do something. The result of my hard work and confidence was great success—I managed to make my business thrive.

On the other side of the coin, I have witnessed many people expecting results but taking no action. Then I did something: I took a leap of faith and started my own business",1
"They would not have any freedom duirng their all life if they follow that plan, because they always will be ""between four walls"", that's not the life that people want and that's not the sad path that parents want for the children I guess and I hope, but you never now what parents want and never ask what you want, and is another presur on their shoulders.

The elective courses are a way to expriment other classes and learn something else that students really want to do or maybe would like to do, I admint that students will learn the necessary, but not what they want, their will be sad if they never had a freedom to do what they want to.

In my conclusion: it's better to take things with calm and peace, not to take it to fast, we still have bunch of time to decide what's really matter and what's matter to us.. Some people think that is a good idea, but actually it is not. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they don't really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students.

They don't have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is. I think we shoul keep folllowing the plan thatbis already planted by the goverment.

The reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason",0
"but that is not possible to do that if he say that the people will be scared with that thing but if I agree with Emerson he can do something about opinion and the people they can do the other opinion and to understand, and how we can agree with other, we can agree something is very important Emerson he can need to stop how to agree or to take out if we do agree we can do each ether. and we can grow we can stay down, he can keep it up not down if will be down how that will be not grow that need to grow is not to stay down.

We can agree about the opinion and to come to understand the agree with the original, the people agree but is not all of them some they agree, because that give the opinion to understand ideas but spicy food that does not agree with person or to the people with other does. Emerson he has a opinion for something he agree and he can do whatever he know but that is not great if you have some ideas you need to took and we can agree each other with other people if we don't know it we can tell with other people they know how they can agree the think we have to agree and that will be good for other people they can say that was very good to agree.

then if that will be great to the people we suppose to it and that is good for the people or person If that he don't to agree the people they can do it many people they do something is important to them if they don;t do anything how they can agree If Emerson does do anything that mean he don't need the people to agree anything with him.

Ex.

I can agree and people they can be able to do whatever they want to do and if they have anyithing we can help each other.. he suppose to agree because there are people they agree and they grow the people have experiences.

Emerson he suppose to agree and people will come to agree with him if is not that the people will not be able to agree with him and that is good to grow, agree is opinion of the people and correspondence the people they have experience to agree and he need to be experiences to other people. I agree with Ralph waldo Emerson because he say that if you try to do something you will never grow and that mean you can't do anything with Emerson. The person can agree and he can't do any opinion but he can understand the opinion that he agree",0
"The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. First impressions are almost impossible to change. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.

Personality can change your first impression. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. Also however they want to come out to you.

Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.

Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression.             . Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. You really dont know who you are really meeting. From your first impression, when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your impression will change. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them",0
"In my opinion, the idea to take off one day of school can have some benefits and some disadvantages, so is bad because in my opinion is a totaly change of schedules and students who work after school can have problems with that, other thing is, for me is not a big chage if they want to save some resources and enegy, but also can be good because the students and teachers rest more and they can save a bit of energy.

The students who have a job can have problems with their bosses and it can make a more hard schedule for the student because they don't gonna have any time to rest and they can have troubles at school if they don't rest the necesari for their health and their consentration at school; other negative thing is because it's unnecessary because it's not a big chage, if the school want to save energy one day don't gonna make a big change and also, maybe it's okay as it's and I think the original schedule with five days of school is good for all and it don't make any problem, and the last negative thing I see is the hours of work of the teachers, the teachers maybe don't do enough hours of work and don't get the same payment and maybe can affect them in that way.

These idea also have positive things like the chance for students and teachers to rest more or just for students, they have more time to do homework or work, other positive thing is to save a bit of energy and some resources, in some way the school can get benefit of these.

The problem with the schedules and the save of energy and resources, are some of the benefits and disadvantages I thought for these theme and in my opinion it's not a good idea to change something what is already working with something who maybe not work very well and something who is don't give big changes.",0
"these are some of the reasons that think you should let us bring our phone to school hopefully you

consider what i have wrote for you. I also think u should let u bring our phones to school cause it would make the school better. then people would want to come to this school because we could bring our phones to school . I think that you should let us bring our phones to school cause what if there is a emergency at our house or with our families and we don't know about it or our parents need to tell us that we cant stay after school because we have to go pick up our little brother or sister.      . then u could use it as a punishment instead of having to think of something else you could just say you cant use you're phone for 2 weeks",0
"So in conclusion I think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods.

When the food is Balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something Health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body. Dear principal ,As a student i think we should balance The school menu of healththeir school lunches is a good idea and also a bad idea, the resaon why is when most students don't take care of their own body by eating junk food but most student like their favorite food for example, most students in my class when they eat their favorite food for example pizza, in lunch it will affect their stomach but not only their stomach but they have nothing health besides milk to eat.

My second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow.

My thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no Fried Chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken.

In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer.

Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them.

Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. m. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Let's make the adoption of curfews come true! . To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship.

"However, the past few years have seen an increase in extreme and often dangerous snow storms, which has led some to consider a longer winter break, but at the expense of shorter summer and one-week fall and spring breaks. Regular breaks give students the opportunity to learn, participate in recreational activities, and create long-lasting memories during these times. With a longer winter break, students will miss out on vital instructional time that is crucial for their mental and social development. As a result, regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are the best option for students, their families, and the overall economy.. Experts have found that longer breaks can discourage spending by students and their families, impacting businesses that rely on the additional income during this time.

In light of these considerations, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are a better idea. Unfortunately, the problems this could cause greatly outweigh the benefits. If this type of break were to be widespread, it could lead to significant gaps in students’ education, which could negatively affect their academic performance. A longer winter break may also have a detrimental effect on the overall economy. While the idea of a longer winter break does have some advantages, the negative consequences could be significant.

The first major advantage to having a longer winter break would be the extra time students get to spend with their families and friends, creating happy memories of the holidays. 
Winter is an incredibly important and popular time for breaks as it has historically been the favorite of students, parents, and teachers alike. Regular winter breaks also keep students out of frigid conditions and instead allows them to enjoy the comforts of home in a safe and secure environment. They provide the perfect balance between academic development and leisure activities so students can go back to school feeling energized and ready to start a new semester",1
"Honesty implies a commitment to telling the truth, no matter the consequences. In every situation, it is best to remain truthful, even if it means navigating difficult conversations or enduring lasting damage to a relationship.. On the other hand, dishonesty often carries negative repercussions because it involves stealing, cheating, lying, and hiding important facts. 
Excerpt:
    The proverb “Honesty is the best policy” is often viewed as an ideal for how we should behave. To summarize, being honest is always preferable to dishonesty. While being honest can sometimes lead to hurt feelings or a loss of trust, it can also create positive benefits in multiple areas",1

""" In this world you decide who do want to be either you get along with it or someone teach you"" although some people think that our character formed by influences beyond our control nevertheless we choose our character traits people on your environment and also people who you talk to i believe that the one that influence me is that we choose our own characters

First People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be and you choose your traits so i think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me he was more kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didnt care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can changes their traits depends on the environment that they are growing.

second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends coasins brotheres we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name recived a call from his parents saying Generic_Name its time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Tes mom i will go home right Away after he finish his call he talked to us saying Dude i need to leabe but like right now!! screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.

to conclude we choose our character traits because we talk and and people around we choos ehow we act aroubd people people who we talk to are the ones that affect us more because thats the one that we do on daily bases the other one people on your enviroment is the way that u want to be looked by different type of people around your self.",0
"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if it's not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",0
"On group works either at school, job or any other place or activity that you could do, sometimes you have the option of working with someone or multiple people, and you can also have the option of working by yourself, we all have our own opinion of either if we would like to do our work by our selves or to work with someone or multiple people for different reasons,and we can all have benefits or working with someone or working individually,and here are going to be reasons why it would be good to work either individually or in group.

When we have the option of working individually or in group, some people may choice i different choice of how they would like to work for different reasons, some people may like to work in groups because they feel that may have more possibilities of talking to their friends or someone that they like, or they may feel that they work may get complicated or may take longer and that they may need help to accomplish it,so they would like to work in group to get help and to finish the work faster.

Some people that would like to work individually may chose that choice because maybe they like to be alone and work by themselves,or maybe because they feel that they okay and that they don't need the help from anyone else to finish or do the work.

In some cause on school, teachers sometimes don't like or don't prefer students working in groups because they want to see if they know how to do the work and if they can actually do it by themselves, or sometimes they worry that one person won't do the work and just let the rest of the people in the group do the work,or just do wherever the other guys are doing, or copy work from them, is true that it could happen in some occasions, but is not always like that,and the reasons why it would be good to allow students to work in group would be that, if every student knows how to the work,then every student can participate doing a different activity on the group and cooperate with anyone, or if the student doesn't know how to do the work, then he\she can get help from his/her partners to explain the him/her how to do the work ,and them she/he can be able to do the work,and they all can be able to participate in the activities.

Has a conclusion, it would be better do work in groups, because in that way it could be easier to get the work done, because you can get help from others in the work,and it would be more fun because you can work with your friends at the same time that they do the work, and it could also be another way of how to met people and make new friends when sometimes you have to work with people that you don't know, and for the people that like to work by themselves, maybe they should know all those benefits of working with people, but is they think that they have no problem working by themselves or that they can get the work done by themselves, then that should be okay to.",0
"and now i do really like who i am always smileing. I say no becuase you cannot jude somonw by there first impressions has a person. You can always change for who you are and for me i was very quiet i would never wanna go talk to poeple because i was really shy with people but now i like to talking to everyone else and i dont care who the person is i always introduce my self.

So i strongly agree with this statement you cannot jude someone by their first impressions some people thought i was really mean when they first met me bcause i would be tired end of the day and i wouldnt walk people because i was lazy and i didnt have that enery to talk. In life nothing is inpossible you can easily chnage to a whole diffrent lets say, your a very mean person you can always change and be super nice to everyone. I wont lie i have based poeple have their first impressions and be like dam there not cool people and end of the day they are cool people. Thats why i changed my mentality so people would not call me lazy because its anoying so thats why i changed my whole life around i didnt wanna be so the same so i just changed, that made me super happy just for having a new life style.

When someone says it is impossible to change their wrong because they dont belive in them selfs that they can change has a new perosn i didnt think i was going to be a whole new diffrent person. Back then i would not like to smile i was a really boring person. Getting to know who the person is by askin them about them self not just be like of there not good enough. It would be nice getting to know the person and if their imature its fine from first impressions. So it is not good juding someone to fast so in my opion i say yes i stronlgy agree.

from Generic_Name                                                                                                                            . For a example if someone is tired and your gunna be like oh their lazy you cant just base them from there firsr impresstions.

Is it impossible to change no its not impposble because it i ur mentality",0
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, '' Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.''

I disagree with Emerson's statement, because you can keep growing by trying and trying hard on whatever you already know.

However; when you try and keep trying somehting is when you grow up more and more each time.

Additionaly, we grow more with stuff that we are good already, because we become more and more greatful.

Primaly, we think that by trying what we already know, it makes us better each time.

Generic_school made a survey to all seniors to get everyone's opinion base on ''Unless you try to do something beyod what you have mastered, you will never grow''. sevendy five percent of students desagree, they said that you learnd more and more of what ever you already know.

In my expecience I have become more and more good of what I already know.

Therefore, knowing more what you already know and you are good at it, you will become better and better each time, never give up on what you are already good at.

Secondary, expericences make us better, we learnd more of we already know, of what we are capable to do.

We have a company that has to do with Generic_school, they go to a lot of schools to talk the the juniors, and seniors of what they think about Emerson's statement.

fifty percent agree and the other fifty persent desagree, because some student say that we need more new stuff to keep succesing in life, and other say that we can still seccess with what you already know.

In my opinion I totaly desagree, sometimes we can keep and keep trying what we already mastered is either you become better or just fail in life.

Therefore trying your best and working hard base on what you already know helps you to grow more in life.

"Being informed and aware of the consequences of their choice, taking a moment to consider their gut instinct, and then making a decision based on what is most important to them is the best course of action.. Seeking input and guidance is beneficial, and empowering oneself with knowledge and facts is invaluable, but the decision will always ultimately come down to the individual. After all, it is impossible for an outside authority to truly understand an individual’s situation or what they value the most. 

Ultimately, the solution lies somewhere in between. On one hand, there is a strong argument for following one’s own instincts, taking personal responsibility, and not relinquishing control of life’s important matters to outside sources. On the other hand, great wisdom can come from heeding the words of those with expertise and experience, who may well have a better comprehension of the various variables at play in a decision-making process. 
Mankind has been debating the merits of self-determination versus trusting the advice of experts and authorities for centuries",1
"It is important to consider a student’s individual needs, academic goals, and current skillset before making this decision.. 

Studies have shown that students who graduate early generally have higher success rates. They are more likely to be accepted into colleges and universities and have a higher rate of college completion than those who graduate at the traditional age.

When it comes to SAT prep, there are several resources available to students who plan to graduate early. 
Graduating from high school one year early has several advantages. For example, students have the opportunity to start college a year early, which can save money in tuition fees. From study guides to online classes, students can find the resources that best suit their learning style and understanding of the material.

In conclusion, it is important to note that although graduating early from high school is beneficial for many students, it may not be the right choice for everyone. It may also give students an extra year to decide on a career and college that is best fit for them",1
"Why I disagree that first impression are almost likely to never change overtime? Well,In this world many people have experience bad,nice,and fake first impressions. You know that you when accomplish somebody smile or laugh that's everything to them is important that is their first reaction and by First Impression you can win the world by been nice all the time and make new friends or win the respect that you deserve or them.. For Example: My Ex BFF a year before we stop talking we meet and is was fun, but until I left to VA she decide to not care for me,text me, or call me. People sometimes come up to you and smile and said hi or was sup because they know you're alone. They bring a side of me that when they said bad stuff they think that I am going to stay quiet. Why because people have a bad feeling about you, you are not aware of what is happening in their heads, and maybe they just wanna take advantages of your personality or who you are.

One, First Impressions that I deal with everyday is give nice impressions with my friends. She smile back to him and then she went to bed.

Two, I have experience bad impressions about people being rude for no reason. I been nice, but sometimes I gotta get mad with people cause they don't even know you and start calling you names but is not worth it to think about that cause that said a lot about their first impressions. Let people talk to you first and then think about their first impression. Fake Impression led you to think that the other person is talking behind your back. That hurt me so much that months past by an you even feel better without that friend because since the begging she was giving me fake impressions and I didnt catch on.

In conclusion, Sometimes you need to calm down before to start speaking to a person. However, the person need to be interest on the topic you're talking about or just be goofy. First Impressions will never change cause once you speak whatever come out your mouth is gonna stick to that person forever. The person pretends to like you, but in particular the person don't care about your feelings or the friendship. I have experience people making fake impressions when they said Hi they look at you a certain way that you know is wrong. The person wants attention all the time but then start talking mess up things about you. If you wanna make new friends or have the respect that you want you only got to show them your nice impression. Be nice and never let negative thoughts on your mind that are going to make you look bad. If your in pain or suffering don't take out your anger on others cause for a first impression you going to be looking like a bad guy. For Example: If a Hispanic kid decide to ask a person for the class room number and that person start to laugh in his face the Hispanic kid gonna feel oppress and feel bad. People don't realize that by first impressions you could win the whole world, but no people like to be hard and act childish.

Three,Fake Impressions make the person to take advantage of your opportunities and your personality. I just give them the same energy back because nobody deserved to be treated on a bad way when you're trying to just said Hi or want a new friends. For Example: In the movie Everything,Everything the girl couldn't go outside because she could get sick,but the new neighbor his name is Generic_Name and he decided to smile and said hi through the window",0
"These experiences provide much needed time away from the rigors of school and studying. This, I believe, is an invaluable experience which is made possible through the extra time schools may provide students with by granting them extended breaks.. We were able to get to destinations and explore sites which we would not have been able to with a two-week summer break. During breaks, I have the time to hang out with my family and also travel. 
As a student, I can personally vouch for the fact that frequent, extended breaks from school would be beneficial. 

By providing students with extended breaks from schools, we are giving them the opportunity to enrich their lives outside school by visiting interesting places, trying new activities, and spending time with friends and family. 

Additionally, having more breaks gives me an opportunity to do fun activities like exploring new cities or trying new outdoor hobbies. Last summer, I was able to take a road trip with a few friends with the additional time provided. From experience, I can attest that having a longer summer break, a longer winter break, and a one-week break in the spring and fall would unduely help students in multiple ways. 

Longer breaks provide students with the opportunity to connect and spend time with family and friends",1
"I could find coconut and banana on a tropical tree. This is why I would want to go to Jamaica If I could go to any place in the world. I would want to sigh see at the top of a mountain. Also I could find stray dog that roam around the streets. I would like also just laying on the sand and enjoy the weather.

I would also go to Jamaica because there is a variety of food. I think I could find goats roaming around eating peoples plants. This place is unique compared to others and also this place has lot of nature. I would also climb the mountains to feel the fresh air. There are many activites I would like to do at a beach or mountain. I would like to find fish that have claws or fish that have fins.

The activites I would do is sight see, swim, and climb or walk to where I want to go.

If I could go any place in the world it would be Jamaica because there are many places you could go to do activities, there is a variety of food,and different types animals.

I would go to Jamica because there are many places to go to do activites like a mountain or a beach. I could find rice and beans in reasturaunts. I might find frogs that are poisonous and ones that are not. If you catch a crayfish or regular fish I would fry it. I could also find crayfish in the water and other fish. I would swim at a beach so I could feel the fresh water. I would probably find chickens or other birds that fly or run.        . Since there are creatures in the water I could look for them. If there is a variety of foods then I could change my eating style while I am there.

Lastly I would go to Jamiaca because there are different types of animals. I could find the variety of foods in reasturaunts, on tropical trees, and in a creek. I could also find snakes that have fangs or are poisonous.

This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. We are going to help the environment to keep it safe from the pollution, to make a better style life for the humans, and save resources for critical moments in the world. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. how conserve energy and resources

The energy, and the resources are the most important factors in the world, for the evolution and survival of the human. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. As you can see there are many resources what we could save, if we have adopt this plan.

In this plan, there are many benefits but also disadvantages. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier.

"some students when they do the work they can not submit it before time end because they do not have good internet.

As result, one student he live in area that they do not have good internet, so when he want to submit the work the network does not working and then he get bad score because he did not submit the work.

So, if the students take the classes in classroom they do not need internet to submit the work.

Therefore, students they do not need internet to submit the work in classroom.

To conclude, students will benefit from taking the classes in classroom to get good grade, understand the lesson and learn form lessons to help them in life time.

Therefore, classroom was benefit more than take the classes online because students will find teacher to help them and they do not need internet to turn the work. . Some students take online classes they think is good to take more classes than in classroom.

However, when they need to turn the work and they are stuck in problem they can not find teacher to help them, or the device has broken, so students they can not turn the work.

Although some people think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it is actually true that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there are no teacher for help them and some students they do not have internet at home.

When the students find a problem they will need teacher for help them to turn the work before the deadline.

However, if there are no teacher for helps them, then students will can not turn the work on time and students will get bad grade.

As result, one student is takes class online, in one day he find problem that he can not understand it and there are no teacher for help him, then he get bad grade because he can not understand the problem to turn the work on time.

So, if the students take the classes in classroom they will turn the work on time because there are teacher in classroom.

Therefore, students need teacher for solve the problem that the students was stuck on it to turn the work.

Some student they do not have internet at home or they do not have good internet to do the work.

"A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade.  ",0

We live in a world where teenagers are pressured to decide their profession long before they can have a full understanding of the variety of occupational paths available to them. 

Research has shown that when students are left to their own explorations and interests after graduating high school, they create paths more suited to their natural abilities and strengths. Examples of successful individuals who eschewed traditional norms to find success include Mark Zuckerberg, who dropped out of Harvard University after launching Facebook, and J.K Rowling, who wrote her first Harry Potter novel while unemployed as a single mother. Requiring high school students to identify their future career can lead to poor decision-making, unnecessary stress, and a lack of exploration of potential opportunities. Such success stories demonstrate the incredible possibilities that can arise when students are given the freedom to pursue a personal career journey without feeling constrained by preset requirements.

In conclusion, pressuring teenagers to determine their career path before they have had the chance to explore other options may have negative consequences that can hinder their future prospects. It is important to create a supportive environment that allows young people to openly explore different career paths and discover the one that is best suited for them.",1
"technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.. I'm going to start explaining and giving my opinion, Technology is one of the main reasons, why the world is changing and accommodating with the necessities that the person have, for example: we live in a community that if everything is easier is better, few years ago people had to walk hours or days to go some where, on this days the transport is a lot easier because the technology had increased,

you can use or have your own car or you,

can take the public transport and go everywhere with out problems and if you want to go to another country you can! because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like.

So technology have a positive effect because is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why i think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, with out saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; no body have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions.

Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for have that note, but all that had changed too,

When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happen;

years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is has be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different",0

Both Science and History have their advantages, but in the end it comes down to each individual student’s interests and goals.

"for the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better.

Graduating in three year will help the students alot, it may take alot of effort, but its a gift and they will be the ones to get something out of it, that's why the students should be able to de everything they can to be successful in their ealy graduation programe. They will have to take courses during the summers and probably in the evening, some may not be able to take elective courses, but it will help them alot in their lifes.

I think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early, because it will be very helpful for them in their lifes, it will give them the chance to eperience college or work force a year early, and they will have one more year to prepare their futrue. If they graduate one year ealy it would help they in college or after college, it would be helpful for them in their future job too.

The students will be able to experience a early college, and they will be able to take their time to get everything they need for their life after college, it will also help some of them in the job they dicide to do, they will have time to get more experience for their job.

It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the dregrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three year and enter college or the work force one year early.

After hours of researching pet daycares, I learned about the level of care they provide to our beloved animals, including not only food and water but also plenty of physical and mental stimulation in forms of indoor activities and access to outdoor space. 

Animals such as fish require a certain balance of water temperature, pH, and salinity among other variables to remain healthy, which must be taken into account when creating a home for them. Learning how to regulate the temperature for plants is essential for their growth and development. 

The living conditions for plants depend on a number of variables, including temperature, levels of soil moisture and nutrients, and light intensity",1
"For example, if they don't understand they could ask one of the student to get help of understanding. Some schools have a program that older student and the young ones that could help one another.

Honesty is a virtue that has been emphasized and celebrated for centuries. 

Ultimately, honesty is one of the most important values to uphold in both our private and professional lives. Being honest and true to oneself can open many doors and provide lasting rewards. Employers look for candidates who are trustworthy and have the courage to stand by their decisions. Employees who are honest are often more reliable and well-respected, which can lead to promotions and recognition over time. It is also easier to build relationships with colleagues when there is mutual trust between all parties. 

Professionally, honesty is highly valued in the workplace. When we make the commitment to be honest, our lives will inevitably become better and more enriching.. This means you don't have to worry about remembering a lie, or make excuses for a truth that might have been hard to say. By always choosing to be honest, you can enjoy many benefits that range from personal to professional development. On a personal level, being honest comes with the reward of having a clear conscience. In addition, people who are honest often have a better sense of self-esteem and self-worth, since they know the right thing to do regardless of the consequences",1

Sometimes we are lazy and we don't want to do nothing, but if we are doing always something we can be more stronger and helpful to the citizen.

my first important why I disagree whith Emerson's statement about individuality :

the humen, or the person, if he whant to be the greatest accomplishment i don't think he can be greatest accomplishment by hemself because he need help from shool or the teacher because you cant do that whithout help .

to be the greatest accomplishment you shoulde to study, or work whith groups not only if you work only you cant understanding you cant investigation your dream .

the work with groups that will help you to know our life that will help you to be greatest accomplishment my most important reason why i disagree whith Emerson's statement about individuality ;

To be th greatest accomplishment you need to study about what you whant to be you need to learn a lot of things about the world and every thing about the world you shoulde be the best one on the earth in conclusin , why i disagree whith Emerson's statement about individuality because he cant be the greatest a ccomplishment to be your self in aworld that is constantly .",0

"That can be done by attending and supporting protests for reform, engaging in conversations that challenge our unconscious biases, investing in Black-owned businesses, and educating ourselves on the histories and literature of different cultures. 
I have always been a firm believer that when you have a goal, no matter how large or ambitious it may seem, it is always possible to accomplish it through hard work and dedication. By taking small but consistent steps every day, I have achieved things that I thought were impossible when I first set out to accomplish them.

This same notion can also be applied to the work of combating racism. This is something I have seen through my own experiences, as well as through others around me. All these small efforts can go a long way in creating the change and progress we so badly need in our society.

By considering all of these factors, students can make an informed decision about their chosen career path.",1
"        . The student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. Students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if it's a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. Athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. They say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. The student should be in control in what they want to do if it's a cub or sport, they will have to make time to put this in their schedule and still have time to study and do homework. This is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one.

Other say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. When you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. A student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. The schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and here's why.

The students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. The school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. Students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how.

Opportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. The school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will want to take away from a club or sport so a student can have time to do the work.

The extracurricular activities should be in control of the students and their family, the school should not limit the amount of activities a student can do. They say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. The student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. Collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. Extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. Although some say extracurricular activities are to enrich educational experiences many say otherwise. There will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. The student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. Doing this can help a student reach goals and they can enjoy their time while doing it. This is why the student should be in control of the activities they do. The students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it",0
"Forcing students to take arts, music, or drama classes may lead to a lack of engagement or even resentment, and both can be harmful to the learning process. To begin, these classes often require special resources and materials which can be expensive for parents and schools alike. 
 Students should not be required to take classes in arts, music, or drama for a variety of reasons. Instead, educators should offer advice on which classes to take as a supplement to other studies, in order to build a well-rounded education.. While many people believe that such classes can help to develop creativity, this development may be more easily obtained through activities and educational opportunities outside of the classroom. Additionally, students come from different backgrounds and interests, and should have the freedom to choose the classes which best suit them. 

Ultimately, it is up to the individual student to decide how to best spend their time and energy",1
"The club encourages developing problem solving abilities, organizational skills, and increases communication skills through meeting with peers and discussing notes.

Finally, an after-school homework club offers a unique opportunity for students to socialize with their peers in a setting outside of the classroom. This allows them to develop relationships in a setting without a grade at stake, as well as having fun when working collaboratively on projects. 
The after-school homework club provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop academically and socially. It allows students to take initiative in their education, as they take part in organizing the club's activities and events, work together in small groups, and communicate with each other in order to get help and advice. 

In sum, an after-school homework club provides opportunities to build academic skills, hone leadership skills, and increase social confidence. 

Secondly, it not only helps with schoolwork but offers the chance for personal growth. It also helps to reduce student stress and promote discipline when it comes to time management. By offering a safe and structured space to work, it is an invaluable tool that could help students to achieve their full academic potential.. With experienced adults on hand, the club can also offer guidance on how to approach problems and foster a collaborative atmosphere that allows students to ask for advice and receive feedback in return. 

Three reasons to support the opening of an after-school homework club are as follows: 

Firstly, an after-school homework club provides a supportive setting for students to work in and provides an opportunity for students to receive help from one another. Additionally, the club can be a great motivator as the environment encourages students to stay on top of their work. 

These three reasons are bolstered by the fact that an after-school homework club offers a unique environment to focus exclusively in study and practice, access to more resources for help, the opportunity to reach out to peers and gain support, and get ahead on any academic goals",1
"It can also be easy for children to become overly obsessed with the technology around them, leading to difficulty focusing in school and sustained feelings of restlessness. Technology has also enabled medical professionals to quickly diagnose and treat illnesses in a more precise and time-sensitive manner. 

Technology can be a force for both good and bad, it is ultimately up to individuals to ensure that they are using technology responsibly and appreciating the advantages it brings to our lives. 

On the other hand, technology can bring many benefits to people's lives, such as improved work schedules and more efficient shopping experiences. In the medical field, technology has proven to be invaluable, with many life-saving advances in treatments and surgeries. . For one, a lack of communication due to technology can result in feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. 
Technology can be seen to have both positive and negative impacts on people",1
"Teenagers do not understand when their parents tell them no, and think a curfew is not needed because they are invincible and bad things never happen to them.

Teenagers need to learn that being more responsible, mature, and becoming a contributing member of society starts with having limits. Curfews are necessary if our society wants to continue to grow in the right direction.. I have already loss friends to violence, and it occurred late at night.

I have friends that have jobs, and they work after midnight even on school nights. Society as it is now needs to support teenage safety, and a curfew would be a great start. They have trouble staying awake in class, and their grades are not good.

A curfew would also address this situation and help them succeed in school.

Being mature at sixteen is hard for some, but it needs to happen.

Parents need to show their children part of maturing is doing the right thing.

Being mature is understanding that you do not need to be outside late at night.

Maturity helps us understand that in life we can not always do whatever we want. Midnight is more than enough time for teenagers to experience life.

There is really nothing good for teenagers out past midnight.

Teenage life is one of the most difficult times in our lives as we still are trying to constantly learn. I have friend that complain about not being able to stay out late, but as they mature they will understand that a curfew really helped keep them safe.

Going outside after midnight is very dangerous.

Teenagers must understand that with everything that has gone on the past decade with gun violence, drugs, and robberies; most of it occurred late at night.

There is a reason that most places are closed late night, and there is really nothing to do late at night.

Teenagers need to value their safety, and know that whatever they can not do before midnight does not need to done.

Curfews can help with this mindset and keep teenagers safe.

To reiterate, society as it is now needs to support teenage safety, and a curfew is crucial part in making this happen. Parents should support being more strict with their children's. Even on the weekend a midnight curfew is more than enough time to enjoy themselves.

It is very dangerous at night, and anybody that is out after midnight increases their chances of doing wrong or becoming a victim.

Teenagers are still learning how to fit into this puzzle of life, and without a curfew to guide them bad things are bound to happen. Teenagers do not understand when they are told why they can not do something or how to deal with rejection.

Teenagers need to learn that being more responsible, mature, and becoming a contributing member of society starts with having limits. Parents should support being more strict with their children's curfew. Curfews will benefit not only teenagers, but society as a whole.

Teenagers think being responsible is not a good thing, because they never want to be told what to do.

If you want graduate from high school you have to be responsible.

Going out after midnight is not being responsible",0
"Great minds all have something in common their mind set and attitude. Although money doesn't give you eternal happiness a good attitude will.

Attitude may not fix all of your problems but it sure does give your life a different route. A great attitude isn't obtained by many but it certainly isn't hard to get. Giving up is never an option especially if it deals with something they love or a dream they have. There are many keys in life there is one made for success and that's attitude. Three things that are there once you open the door is a better life style, better opportunities, and more money. If achieving a goal in life is so hard, then why did most High school drop outs become something great? Not all but the ones who did succeed in life they were determined and had a positive attitude about struggles they encountered. People who have this characteristic usually don't stress as much because they change the negative to positive.  . Employers might just move him up to something more important or give him a raise.

Money is something worked and sweated for, and for those who have to work ten times harder than others generally fix their mentality and attitude. Since he is giving 100 percent all the time it will make him stand out since he is not just another employee. If he would've change the way he thought maybe to ""if i wasn't smart enough for this job i wouldn't have gone this far."" Now he would be giving 100 percent instead of 50 percent. Great attitude takes in life and makes them better. All success in life leads back great attitude and awesome mentality. The Key to success is to have a positive attitude and mind set because the person with a positive attitude will gain a healthier life style, a better career, and money.

Positive attitude comes from a good mentality and when people have that they see life differently. Since they do not stress as much, don't let others get under their skin, and rarely give up they live healthier and happier.

Careers are a perfect example of the power of good attitude; If a doctor goes into work saying ""I'm not smart enough for this job."" Is it possible that his way of thinking limits the way he works? it may, because he will go on with his day giving 50 percent when he needs to give 100 percent. Money is all over the place it just takes the right mind set and attitude to get it. Success is said to be hard with a negative attitude, but why should attitude define the destiny of a person? Life is full of surprises but with a good attitude you can overcome just about anything. They have patience and don't get irritated so easily or in other words they are unbothered by others",0

"Second, teenagers can have more time to spend it with they are family and friends. also, teenagers can have more time to spend it with they are family and friends. because, being out at night for to late might be dangerous. For instance, adults and teenagers are busy in their daily life teenagers go to school adults go to work in the morning they don't see each other often and, they dont have enough time to spend it with each other and talk to each other so they can have more time at night to spend it with each other and talk .

First, being out at night for to late can be dangeruos. Finally, so they can be more responsible.. It is true that curfew keep teengers out of trouble. In that age teenagers make a lot of mistakes it because, they don't have a lot of experience like adults do so they must listen to adults and follow the crufew in that way they can be safe and more responisble.

For these reasons, curfew keep teengers out of trouble.

"In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age.

I see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. They do not like going to work as much. When I am older , I want to be at least a little happy with what I have my career as.

In the other sides opinion, I do see why committing to a career at a young age is pretty important too. For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now?

Many people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. . Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future.

Students still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age. But many might not go for that career in the future . Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different . It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.

When students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it ",0

Recent research shows that students who get involved in extracurricular activities like sports, music, or art can show an improved academic performance in school. 

Physical activities, such as sports, have the added benefit of increasing physical strength and endurance. Furthermore, participating in sports helps children maintain a healthy lifestyle and build up a stronger immune system.  All of these benefits can not only help students succeed now but also benefit them in the future.. The positive long-term effects of extracurricular activities include increased self-confidence, better time management skills, improved discipline, and a better understanding of how important working together as a team is. 

Parents should be interested in their children's extra-curricular activities as they provide a chance for them to grow and make a positive difference in their lives. This is because extracurricular activities give children a place to meet and bond with other children outside of the regular school environment which helps in developing a better understanding of how to interact with peers and handle social situations. This helps children learn better in class and improves their concentration. Studies have also proven that students who participate in activities after school show better social and emotional wellbeing",1
"I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first.

As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. But also is the way that you can work and get money. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.

Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.

Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. . We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.

First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future",0
"Additionally, the extra time might also offer parents more flexibility when it comes to their own work and personal obligations. 
Extending student release time can have a vast impact on a variety of aspects associated with a school. From a student well-being perspective, extra time available can give students the opportunity to engage in activities and leisure which could potentially help mitigate stress and improve academic and mental performance. Ultimately, the extent of these implications will depend on the type and magnitude of the modification in student release time.. On the other hand, increased release time could present new challenges in terms of after-school transportation, as schools and families may need to adjust their schedules towards the new reality of later release times",1
"When someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely.

When we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. Each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it.

Working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. For example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. Working with someone else can bring many benefits and opportunities to everyone, but there is many people who prefer to work by their self . But many people are looking where they can work with people from different types of cultures and listen every idea or opinions in life. For example, in USA there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. Even other students would prefer to be there.

Many people would like to be in a place where they can share and work together. Having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. having someone to work with, can make evening easier than working alone. working in a group can help to have done everything on time, and we can establish a good environment in the classroom. Two minds think better than one. Otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. Every teacher should allow or try to create a better place where students feel comfortable. Because, they are helping each other. .

"Do you want your kid to be assisted by a older student? Well look no further, this program could make your child be more smarter, prepare the young student for whats coming in the future, and a older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework.

The older student that is assisting the younger student could make him smarter. For example, the older student can teach the concepts of algebra which the younger student is taking next year. The older kid already knows the concepts of the subjects that the younger student is taking, which means he will teach him the concepts. This program can make your child be more smarter, be prepared for whats coming in the future, and a older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework. This is why the program is helpful. The young student might even study algebra with the older student. The older student can teach what he is learning to the younger student. This means that the younger student would already know the concepts of the three subjects that the older student taught him which is science, language arts, and math.

The older student can prepare the younger student for the future. The older student can teach other subjects like physical science, and civics economics which the young student could be ready for.

The final reason why this program is helpful is because the older student helps the younger student with his homework. The younger student might ask for help on his homework and the older student will help him. If the student does not understand the question then the older student would teach him.

This program is actually pretty good for your child if he does not understand and need help on a subject that he has trouble on.                      . What i mean by this is that the older student will help the student on math, language arts, and science which the older student already took",0
"Growing up, she was the first to tell me never to give up and to remember that it is ok to make mistakes. I often reflect on her words of advice; particularly when I am in the process of making a decision. From an early age, her words of wisdom and years of experience have shaped the way I look at the world and how I make decisions. With her sage advice, she taught me that mistakes give you the opportunity to grow and to learn.

One of the most vivid examples of her advice was when I started to become overwhelmed with all of the opportunities in front of me when studying for college.

She told me to just take things one step at a time and to remember that the choices I make do not have to be permanent. Her support has helped me find my own inner strength, as I have come to the realization that it is alright to make mistakes.

"While there are clear advantages to allowing cell phones, such as convenience and possible access to educational resources, there are also risks such as distractions and challenging teachers’ authority. Therefore, these pros and cons must be weighed carefully as administrators determine the best policy for their school.. On the one hand, cell phones can provide convenience, lowering the cost of communication between families and providing a connection to emergency services should the need arise. In addition, allowing students to use cell phones can be a challenge to teacher authority, as it can be difficult for teachers to ensure that students are not using their phones during class time. In addition, cell phones can provide access to educational tools, such as instructional videos and online resources that can supplement a student's studies. On the other hand, allowing students to use their phones during passing period and lunch time can be a source of distraction, as well as a challenge to teacher authority.

From a convenience perspective, cell phones allow students to stay in touch with their families more easily and cheaply than ever before. This has created a debate around the issue of allowing students to use these devices during passing periods and lunch time. This can interfere with learning, as it can take students’ attention away from their academics. 

However, allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time can lead to distractions such as playing games, texting, or social media surfing. This can provide peace of mind to both parents and students, as parents can be assured that their children are safe and that they are able to contact them quickly in the event of an emergency. 

Ultimately, a decision must be made about allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time.

Asking multiple people for advice is something that can help you find a quicker solution. There are many positive sides when asking people for advice, like having different points of views that can give you tons of ideas and information for the advice that you are looking for. . I think only taking one persons advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice, another positive thing about asking advice is you can also learn something new or meet someone new.

Asking multiple people is better than asking one person for advice, because only asking one person may not get you the advice that is best needed. You can also meet someone new and develop communicating skills.

"It is important to conserve energy both financially and ecologically — environmentally-friendly energy conservation can lead to economic and environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money on energy bills. By conserving energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint, help protect the environment, and make significant cost savings.. Teachers can encourage students to move away from traditional paper-based learning activities and use digital applications instead. 
Conserving energy is one of the most important elements of sustainability and resource conservation. There are also many ways individuals can help conserve energy in everyday life, such as turning off lights when leaving a room, washing clothes in cold water, buying products with the Energy Star label, and recycling.

Ultimately, the best approach is to embrace the idea of continuing to explore and push limits. Doing so will yield tremendous rewards, both personally and professionally. She took a risk, believed in her dreams, and ended up creating history with her tremendous success. 

Another example of taking a leap of faith outside of one’s comfort zone is drawn from my own personal experience. In order to truly lead a fulfilled life, it is necessary to be willing to take risks, be open to new experiences, and try the things that challenge us. After rising up from an impoverished childhood, Oprah created an entire media empire despite not having any previous experience in the television and film industries. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote that, ""Life is a journey, not a destination."" This simple statement succinctly captures the importance of exploring beyond our comfort zones. When I was younger, I was incredibly shy and introverted and was always nervous and afraid to try new things. As Emerson said, “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.” Exploring beyond our comfort zones will always lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our world.. However, once I made the conscious effort to step out of my comfort zone, I have achieved more confidence and have gone on to accomplish some of my biggest life goals. 

One great example of a person who stepped outside of their comfort zone and achieved amazing success is Oprah Winfrey",1
"Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. On the other hand. Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades.

One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do.

My conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. This is not help a student's learning at all. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want.

There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. People from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. In a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. The students can focus on their studies.

When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. Students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. At home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a student's work.. Learning from home won't have the distractions that a classroom has. Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. If a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won't stress about work. There are many more opportunities with public schools",0

"By consciously making decisions with an awareness of our own individual experiences, we are better able to weigh our options and make decisions that are in our best interest. For example, research has shown that a person's upbringing has an important role in shaping their understanding of the world and the behavior they accept as normal. Taking ownership of our lives and learning from the hardships life throws our way can ultimately help us become more resilient and better equipped to handle future challenges.. It is important for individuals to become aware of how their life experiences have influenced them, so they can take control of their own lives and use the hardships they have gone through to become stronger. 
The life experiences we encounter can have a profound effect on our understanding of the world and our own behavior. Additionally, external events like death, physical illness or injury, and even day-to-day decisions can cause dramatic behavioral changes",1

"However, this method may lead to disappointment and discontent if the aspirations are not achieved. 

In conclusion, it is important to determine a reasonable balance between aiming high and aiming low. On the one hand, aiming high can give people the ambition and motivation to work hard and become the best they can be. If they succeed, they will likely gain satisfaction, recognition and self-esteem. 
When aiming for success, one must decide whether to aim high or to aim low. On the other hand, aiming low may lead to a sense of comfort and complacency in reaching more attainable goals, but these successes will not be as significant as when one has taken a risk with more challenging targets. Having ambitious goals encourages us to challenge ourselves and strive for better, while aiming low enables us to be mindful of our limits in order to set achievable goals that we can be proud of.",1
"

In conclusion, while first impressions are usually hard to shake off completely, it is definitely not an impossible feat. It takes an open mind and patience to change one’s opinion and create a different perspective, but with the right attitude it is achievable.. This becomes especially true when the negative first impression is based on physical appearances, pre-existing prejudices, or any type of prior knowledge of the person/situation in question.  

On the other hand, there are also instances when first impressions are not necessarily set in stone and can be changed with deliberate effort and the willingness to look past one’s initial judgment. As humans, we are capable of recognizing our own biases and can learn to consider another’s opinion without jumping to conclusions. For example, if a person first sees another person they deem as unapproachable, unfriendly, or unkind, it may be quite difficult to convince them to give that person a second chance. 
The saying that “first impressions are almost impossible to change” is one that often rings true in many situations. While the truth of this statement largely depends on the individual’s personality, experiences, and expectations regarding the particular person or situation they are encountering, it often holds true that a person’s initial impressions of something or someone can be hard to change. With the right attitude and a readiness to learn and understand, it is possible to modify one’s first impressions and develop a more accurate evaluation of the person or situation in question",1

"From Thomas Jefferson's famous maxim that encouraged citizens to ""never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today,"" an active and industrious spirit has been fundamental to our success. From everyday people to entire nations, an idle lifestyle can often lead to stagnation, which often leads to missed opportunities and, in some cases, a complete reversal of fortune.

In order to avoid a similar fate and ensure a prosperous future, active behavior must remain at the forefront of our minds.  So let us take his words as a reminder to stay active and seize the day so that we can create a better future and leave behind a lasting legacy.. But if history has taught us anything, it's that idle behavior comes with a price. 
Throughout American history, the push for active thought and behavior has been a key factor in our nation's progress. Such a mindset will not only help us reach our individual goals more efficiently but will also benefit the country as a whole. Taking Thomas Jefferson’s words to heart, we must not be afraid to invest our time and energy into something today rather than waiting until tomorrow. Unfortunately, this has had dire consequences more than once, leading to tragic consequences and lost opportunities.

Today, technology has made it easier than ever to live an idle lifestyle. However, the flip side of this mentality has been the risk of becoming too passive and idle in our society. We can use our devices to make our lives easier and put off taking action until tomorrow, or even until next week",1

"Plus, the longer these relationships are maintained, the stronger the sense of trust will become.. Lying can lead to mistrust both in the present and in the future. Lying can be especially damaging in long-term relationships as people come to doubt the validity of what a person is saying or doing.

Honesty is the key to cultivating and maintaining strong relationships. Not only can it lead to respect in relationships, but it also fosters a greater sense of security. By speaking honestly and openly, it is easier for family and friends to understand each other and to be more connected. It can cause feelings of guilt and anxiety, making communication difficult. However, while honesty can be an advantage in relationships, it can also be a double-edged sword. In the context of family and friends, being honest can aid in creating a comfortable and trusting bond. On the one hand, speaking honestly can allow family and friends to gain a clear understanding of each other. On the other hand, it can at times lead to hurt feelings, arguments, and other consequences.

Being dishonest, or lying, can be just as damaging. As the saying goes, honesty is the best policy. 
Honesty is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship",1
"because the school doesnt think about the students family or what they got going on at that time they just want to boss the kids around and tell the students to go ot not go.. and why im saying this is because the school does not have no right to tell you you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school asignments or afterschool studying then i suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it. like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do or they can pick the ones that's going to help them the most in the future of school or in thier adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activites that they learned or did so they wont have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money and you can also get money if you help someone that doesnt know how to do that type of thing.

And thats why i think it should be the students and parents choice if the students want to or not do extracurricular activities. then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activties and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you dont have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends.

but i think the school should give the students and thier faimly diffrent choices of extracurricular activties so the students can pick 2 or 3 diffrent types of them instead of not having time for thier own life. or if you want to do great in school or in any job and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activites.

Second of all, if the parents dont think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activites and if you dont have enough time for study sessions or you homework because your to tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. To begin with, in my opinion i think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activties",0
"However, failure can be the key to education and success when properly leveraged. 
Failure is a fact of life, and even successes such as Hilary Clinton, soccer players, people in government, and other famous people have faced failure in their lives.  By learning from failure, one can gain a valuable education and the patience necessary to move forward.. When faced with a setback, the key is framing it as an opportunity to learn and grow. To do this, one must take the time to analyze the situation, identify where mistakes were made, and develop a strategy to move forward. Secondly, it is beneficial to set achievable goals and develop a plan of action to accomplish them. Setbacks should be seen as a learning experience and treated as part of the journey, rather than a sign of failure. 

Finally, once a strategy has been developed, it is important to take action. By understanding which areas might need further development, one can make an effort to seek out resources and mentors who can provide valuable insights on how to move forward and make the best of a difficult situation. Monotonous tasks, such as developing and following a daily routine, can be particularly helpful in developing healthy habits and cues to remind oneself of the progress that has been made. After all, failure does not have to be the end, but can be the beginning of a new path to personal success. 

One useful strategy for facing failure and overcoming obstacles is to become familiar with one's own strengths and weaknesses. An important part of this process is to be patient with oneself and to recognize that the process of overcoming failure is not instantaneous, but requires time and dedication",1
"Many schools and universities have varying policies surrounding the use of cell phones in learning environments, ranging from complete bans to learning scenarios that include cell phone use. Arguments for and against the use of cell phones in the classroom can be found on both sides of the discussion. Additionally, text messaging, email, and other online communication tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between students and teachers. 

Overall, the effects of cell phone use in the classroom will depend heavily on the policies and administration monitoring their use. Cellphones can be used to cheat on tests, watch videos, or send messages if not monitored properly. Additionally, too much reliance on cell phones can lead to students not learning the material in-depth. The benefits of technology must be balanced with the possible negative impacts to ensure a safe and productive learning environment. . 
Cell phones have become integral elements of modern life, so it is no surprise that their use in the classroom has been receiving much attention. 

Positively, cell phones can offer many benefits to the learning process, enabling students to access information quickly and easily. Smart phones are also able to capture photos and videos that students can use for research projects.

"Without communication, trust in team dynamics is lost, as is the opportunity for success.. Communication was also imperative to the success of the game during this period. Thanks to the combination of his natural talents and hardworking attitude, Alex and his teammates achieved success on the field.

In conclusion, both talent and hard work are essential for success in professional soccer, as evidenced by the role communication plays in the game and the example of Alex Hunter's combination of skill and dedication. Alex was a naturally talented player, possessing the skills necessary to lead his team. 
Professional soccer in the late 1800s required immense skill and hard work to achieve success. Players worked tirelessly perfecting their techniques and detail-oriented skills while simultaneously developing their endurance. Although he was gifted in the game, his drive and determination allowed him to work just as hard as his teammates. The ability to effectively communicate planned plays and strategize with teammates could make or break a team.

To demonstrate the significance of both talent and effort, I'd like to use the example of a fictional soccer player, Alex Hunter",1
"With on the job training, fresh perspectives, and alternative experience, a candidate can be just as successful as one with prior job experience.. This means that an employer may not need to worry about skills gaps that would need to be filled with a more experienced hire. There are a variety of digital certifications and classes available online that can help new hires to gain skills and knowledge that can be used towards the job at hand. 

Secondly, potential employers often look for people who have fresh perspectives that could potentially add value to their team. This type of experience can demonstrate that the candidate is enthusiastic, willing to learn, and has the communication and teamwork skills needed to succeed with the position. For a company, taking a risk and hiring a novice can be a great way to foster an innovative culture that brings value.

Finally, employers may consider a potential employee who has leadership or volunteer work experience instead of job experience. However, there are many cases in which individuals have been hired and have achieved success without any prior job experience. A potential employee may not have experience, but they can bring new insights and ideas that a more experienced hire may not have. 
There is an often-misheld belief that employees must possess experience in order to obtain a job and succeed. 

In conclusion, although a candidate may not have any job experience, this does not mean that they cannot obtain a job or succeed. There are a few key reasons why this is the case.

First of all, having on-the-job training can often be an equally valuable asset to a potential employer as experience itself",1

"Both sides bring valid points to the conversation, and when making decisions, it can be helpful to weigh both the potential advantages and disadvantages.. They point to examples such as the importance of developing trust in relationships, companies, and governments. 
Honesty is a hotly debated topic, with strong arguments on both sides. The consequences of not being honest can also be significant. On one side, many people argue that honesty is always the best policy. Honesty also shows respect for others; by being honest, we demonstrate that we recognize and value their feelings, considerations, and rights. This could include the potential for hurting others’ feelings or causing distress due to being overly blunt. People often experience feelings of guilt, deceit, and shame resulting from dishonesty, leading to a sense of internal unrest. Being excessively honest could also strain relationships, damage one’s reputation, and create an environment of mistrust.

Ultimately, the debate of whether honesty is the best policy continues. On the other side of the debate, some claim that there can be drawbacks to being too honest",1

    Being prompt is an invaluable life skill that can open doors of opportunity, increase productivity, and lead to better outcomes in many aspects of life. Taking the initiative to meet deadlines and complete projects ahead of time communicates that one is organized and responsible. Setting reminders or asking for help from family and friends can be useful in providing accountability.

On the contrary, those who are habitually late can appear unreliable and inconsiderate, leaving a lasting impression. Practicing appropriate time management and having realistic expectations can also help to keep on track. Promptness is especially important in the professional world; arriving to meetings, client calls, or events on time shows respect and implies reliability. To ensure promptness, it is important to create a plan in advance and make sure to leave plenty of time for surprises. Even if a person is merely a few minutes late, it can affect their professional reputation and interfere with their work relationships. 

Though there is great reward in being prompt, it can be a challenge to make sure one is always on time. People who are laid back with time can find themselves lagging behind, missing important events, and otherwise avoiding success.

Overall, being prompt can be highly beneficial and help to ensure positive outcomes. Taking the necessary steps to be prompt and on time will lead to improved productivity and progress in life.",1
"Some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem even if the work is not the students best effort.

I believe that is not the best choose a student's to practice this work to build self- esteem; for many reason, because some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree this is no the best way to improve in their self-esteem to practice on praising. And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Reason some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree, i think this is not the best way to improve in their self-esteem, because students they believe in praising but, this is not the option to learn in their self-esteem they need to focus in their achievements. . I think this are two different thinks, also one is believe in religion, for example: I belief in Jesus this is praise they don't need to compare, but i don't dismiss this idea,because is good idea to students believe in praising. Also students they has the last world, if they need to practice the things the some people thinking to the benefit for their self-esteem.

1. even if some people belief on praising,they think this help students to believe in praising i think students believe in this source but is not the principal option to believe in praising they need to focus in their achievements, values and skills because is one the priority and purpose to believe in their self-esteem this ideas must be to help to lean focus.

Students need to improve in their achievements, because some people are not sure if this come from, praise or achievements. Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments.

Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students don't believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future.

In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand",0

When we fail we learn from our mistakes and try again and be successful because failure is actually helping you in the pursuit of success.

On the pursuit of success we will have some hard times ahead of us, and does hard time are the mistakes we will end up making and form does mistakes comes success. Failure helps thousands of people become successful in life.

When you are trying something new, you have to happy about it, and when you fail doing that new thing you should still be happy because it is your first time doing it, and when you fail you always get a second chance to do it again, and when you fail the second time you get another chance, it will keep going until you get it at the end and giving up is not an option. Once again giving up is not an option in the book of life. And when you try new thing and you fail and you give up strait away you, are not being successful, you are just ruining your life an becoming a failure because you gave up strait away. Going to the next level is a big thing in life good things start coming your way and more people start to like you because of the challenges you went through and failing helped you become successful at the end of those challenges.

I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it can help us in life and in the future.. Going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm can help be successful in the end because you tried and tried again and it gave you more confidence to go on and try things you haven't done before",0
"When working independently, one has the opportunity to responsibly manage their own time and decide which tasks need to be completed and when. Ultimately, the decision of which approach to take on a school project depends on the skills and preferences of the individuals involved.. This allows the individual to work without being influenced by anyone else’s presence or ideas. Working in a group also provides shared accountability, allowing each member to feel supported in completing their part of the assignment. 
Working independently and working in a group both have their advantages when working on a school project. On the other hand, when working in a group, members can bounce ideas off of one another to come up with more robust solutions and develop their communication and collaboration skills",1
"Those are my reasons to do a perform community and, I will like your school to participate with us on having a clean area to live in.

Thank you. Dear Principal,

The reason why I'm writing you this letter is because, I would like your students and all your school to help us to do a perform community service.

All the schools are planning to do one in their community because the state weather its not so good in the communities, because of the contamination of the fabrics and cars, its better for the students and teachers to do a community service because that way we can have a better life without contamination and another way that helps is that we can have a better health",0
"I want to work there because i cant get things faster and i can see what there going to drop every Thursday. people make a living out of it because some thing cause millions of dollars working there can get me thing that are vary expensive for free of half the price. and one day i want to move to Generic_City or visit it for a summer vacation. My brother and i are trying to start a big supreme culashoin. And seeing if im a good worker and to see if the boss will let me stay there . Its to get experiences i want to help him with his work and i want to feel all the presser he gets so one day i try to start something ill have the experiences. I want it to be my first job. But theres a lot of people that get supreme and make a living out of it like they buy it and then make there own website and then they sell it for lots of money.

thats how Gucci started that had hard time but one day the blue up they started selling a lot of things but Gucci is very expensive. i like showing people about the history of supreme when it first came out or when did it start getting famous and i like telling stories about the things they sell. but Generic_City is the original place where it was first created.

I feel like ill be caorthuble working there because thats the thing i like doing and thats the type of stuff ill like to sell and I will like working there because my brother likes supreme and i like it to. In Generic_City and

Generic_City both have a supreme store. I think the supreme store is a good job. So thats why i want to work there. to work there for a while. So i want to show the boss that im a good worker but i want to see if that job is for me because if i go and work there for a day and the boss likes me and tells me to stay and i dont want to stay working there because the job is no for me im going to regret it. so i can learn how to work.

Why i want to work there is because supreme toys or hats or cups are vary valuable and by the older it gets the more is caused. and then i can see if i can start a store over hear. After doing all of that i want to start my own organization so i can start something like that thats why i want to work there because i can learn about the how he started supreme and what he did to make supreme famous. But i feel like its fun to start some bigness like that.

I feel like working there is going to be fun i want to see how it feels how to work there and i want to see if im a good worker. I want to work at a supreme store for a day in Generic_City or Generic_City.              . but new thing or valuable to if the people like it and if it sells out . working there can help my brother and i because i can tell my brother what are they going to drop and what they are making for the future. so i think they should let me stay. I want to help my brother to have a big supreme culechion so one day he can sell it and make lots of money i want to help my family.

my brother and i cutlet supreme. supreme is not that expensive when it drop but when you buy it and then resell it thats when the price go up.

I feel like working there in the supreme store is fun because working there you can talk to lots of people works there or go shopping. so it gets more expensive by the time lot of people go for old staff because its valuable and if you want to resell it youll make money of of it. I think working in the supreme store can sometime give use free stuff. each week they drop new supreme things like bags and cups and hats t shorts they drop new thing each Thursday and new thing they dont drop the same things because if they drop the same things each week the value of the the thing they dropped it will go down so they make share that everything the drop is new. But if i like it and the boss tells me to stay i will stay and maybe move to

Generic_City of & Generic_Citynbsp; but i want to go there for a summer so work docent distraked me from school. what makes me want to work there. And i cant see what there making whats on its way for the future. I dont know if its a good working there or if they pay good money to work there for a day or two but thats why i want to try something new some thing that i enjoy",0
"Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. Studnets might like only one class and has a talent on that particular class, they should be allowed to take that particular class and does not have to take other classes.

Instead of forcing students to take every class, it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the studnet is interested in. Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. If a student does not want to participate in any particular class because of their personal reasons, schools should not force them to take those classes.

It is not that classes like arts, music and drama are not important to students. They don't prefer to go to those schools where the students are forced to take every classes. I believe that it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the student is interested in, than to force them to take every class. If a person is not interested in something, you should not force them to like it. As it is a waste of time to both teacher and student. Elective Classes

I believe that classes like arts, music and drama should be elective to the studnets. Students prefer to go to that school where they can choose classes as they want. If students are to take every classes, it might be too much for them to handle.

"Additionally, students may also factor in the amount of time involved in the activity, as many are already juggling schoolwork with extra-curriculars. For students with tight budgets, the cost can be a deterrent, especially if the cost of supplies and equipment for the activity is high. The availability of activities is an important consideration, as is the cost associated with the activity. 
When it comes to deciding whether to pursue extracurricular activities, students consider a variety of factors.  Lastly, students might also take into account their own goals - whether or not they are passionate about the activity, whether they can gain practical experience or develop skills - when choosing which activities to pursue.",1

"Thats why I thank that having a good attitude will make people want to hang out with you.

Last but not list having a good attitude will make people respect you. Thats why I thank having a good attitude will get people to like you.

Having a good attitude can make people want to hang out with you. That why i thank having a good attitude will make people respect you.

Those were all my expels of how having a good attitude will help you. Some benefits of having a good attitude are that more people will like you another reason is that people will want to hang out with you and the last reason is that people will respect you.

Having a good attitude will get people to like you. It will also get people to like you because they will tank your a wonderful and positive person. It will help by making people like you, make people want to hang out with you, and make people respect you.. Is it true that people can often credit their successes to having a good attitude? well yes it is, I have seen people like my uncle become successful in life because of their attitude. Another reason why is because maybe you can make people happy or make their day by just saying one word. So if you want to be respected you have to respect others. It will make people respect you because you will treat people with respect and theres a saying that says treat people how you would like to be treat. It will get people to like you because you won't be mad all the time. A reason why is because you won't be boring and will have positive things to talk about. I have also seen people go from being successful to being unsuccessful",0
"Too often, people lack the courage to stand up for themselves and make their own decisions. It is important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to most decisions and that what works for one person is not necessarily the best option for another.

When making decisions, it is important to ensure that the choices being made ultimately reflect our individual values and desires. 
In life, it is important to make decisions that will best benefit yourself and your future. This can lead to feelings of regret down the line and a lack of confidence in one’s ability to make decisions independently.

Making decisions without relying on the advice of experts can be intimidating, but it also represents a chance for personal growth and increases in self-esteem. People should instead strive to make decisions that best reflect their own individual goals and values. This is an important exercise in self-awareness which will aid in making informed decisions that best reflect individual values and desires.

In conclusion, relying too heavily on expert advice when making decisions can be a dangerous thing. Seeking the advice of others, including experts, can be beneficial, but personal autonomy should be the primary factor in decision-making. People should be encouraged to question the advice they receive and weigh the potential outcomes of their decisions before deciding which action to take. Too often, people rely on the advice of experts to make decisions that may be in their best interests. This is an important life skill that can lead to increased confidence, as well as greater autonomy and satisfaction in the choices being made.",1
"And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch. I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school.

If we put policy number 2 at school it wouldn't make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time. I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time I don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. Dear Principal

The Police i think is correct is Policy 1. So I think that school are a problem while using it in class but I think that is not bad to use it during lunch time or free time.",0
"By recognizing great student work, teachers can provide a source of inspiration to the students they are teaching. 
True self-esteem comes from achievement – the knowledge that one has changed the world in some tangible way, even if only in a small corner of it. 

Praising great students in the learning environment can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage others to reach for their own goals. 

In conclusion, the source of true self-esteem is achieved through tangible accomplishments that recognize and honor a person's hard work. While lofty goals are laudable, even smaller accomplishments can be empowering and show a person the value of their contribution. Building a strong work ethic, taking on responsibility, and working towards goals can all contribute to the development of self-esteem. Praising great students can create a healthy, motivational environment that encourages others to reach for their goals. By celebrating small triumphs and successes, all can appreciate the value of their work and develop greater self-esteem.. Praising students for their accomplishments creates a positive feedback loop, creating an outlook that emphasizes effort and hard work rather than perfectionism. It can help students take pride in their work and contribute to the larger culture of achievement",1

Organizing a community service project to help improve the environment in my local area requires breaking the project into smaller, manageable steps. For example, if my goal is to plant more trees, I must determine the type of tree and how many trees will be planted and the location for the planting.

Next, I need to determine any additional resources needed for the project such as plants, soil, tools, funds, volunteers, and so on. This could involve reaching out to local businesses or organizations for donations or support, recruiting volunteers, and leveraging social media. I must also create an outreach plan for getting the help needed in order to successfully complete the project. Some possible goals could be to reduce air and water pollution, plant more trees, clean up parks and public areas, and so on. First, I must identify a specific goal for the project. Finally, I need to set up a timeline that will ensure the project is completed on time.. Once I have identified the goal for the project, I must specify how this goal can be achieved",1
"This technique I used encouraged me to think outside the box and stray away from pre-existing notions of right and wrong. Imagination has the capacity to push boundaries and open the door to new realms of knowledge and understanding. 
Immagination is a powerful tool, yet often it is overlooked in favour of knowledge. I use various techniques to tap into my imagination and let it flow freely so that I can create stories of my own design. I am constantly learning from my imagination and using its resources to explore the endless possibilities of life. To put it succinctly, Albert Einstein once said that, “imagination is more important than knowledge.” This thought has proven to be true in my life experiences. Imagination has provided me with endless opportunities to explore and expand my creativity in ways that sheer knowledge could not. When coupled with knowledge, the potential for personal growth becomes limitless.. Researching facts and understanding concepts was far easier once I was able to think critically and use my own ideas to solve problems. 

In many ways, my imagination has become an integral part of my intellectual and creative development. For this reason, I believe that Albert Einstein’s famous saying that “imagination is more important than knowledge” is an accurate statement. 

For example, instead of falling back on memorization and rote learning when studying for a test, I found it was more beneficial to use my imagination. 

Moreover, my imagination has been a great source of inspiration for my hobby of writing",1

Having a positive mindset and developing strategies for how to cope with potential failures can have a significant impact on one's response to difficult times. It is important to remember that mistakes and failures can lead to growth, and having a positive outlook is the key to navigating difficult times.. Positive self-talk can help reframe challenging situations, providing a more realistic and balanced perspective and giving individuals the encouragement and motivation needed to cope with any challenges they may face. Additionally, having a positive attitude can lead to more productive problem-solving, increased motivation and improved overall mental wellbeing",1
"She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. Doesn't mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess.

Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. Some of them have to fail because it's not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesn't matter what. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. Sometimes we have to pass throught dificults situationt to get to the sucess. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life.

We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. But she didn't give up because of that.

People have to know that doesn't matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it won't help us to get the succes that we want. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.

Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. All can be hard but never imposible. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. Not all the time going to be easy. She accomplish her dream, doesn't matter what. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. The succes is what people really want all the time, but it is not easy at all. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation ''Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are.                . At the end we can see the result. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university",0
"And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and can't concentrate.

A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and don't have worry about a curfew or going home really late. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen.

Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.. And parents should just be more protective so they don't end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school.

with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school.

Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time",0
"Use your imagination.. I think you should agree too because you can use your imagination to become a genus at you school, job or even your house o with your family. He was smart but he used his imagination too.

In conclusion, I agree with what Elbert Einstein said because he had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest people, he lived through a lot, he was really smart. He also learned a lot from being a genus but he did live through a lot and he was a human.

Also, I think that Elbert Einstein created cool inventions and gadgets from his imagination he needed a wild imagination to think and create a lot of cool things that is most likely why he said this quote. Elbert Einstein created and invented a lot of thing and to make to things he needed a strong imagination.

In addition, Elbert Einstein was really old and really smart so he lived through a lot as a human not as genus. I agree because Albert Einstein had to have a strong imagination to become really smart, Albert Einstein lived through a lot so he knows a lot, Elbert Einstein is smart.

To begin with, I think that Elbert Einstein had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest human beings to ever live. He was really smart that is why I think he said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he had to have a strong imagination to think and become really smart. Do you agree with Albert Einstein when he said ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I think that is true because if you have now imagination than how are you going to get knowledge",0
"and don't believe on what they say about you is not being honest to them self either. so be honest all the time.. alot of people like to be trusted so be honest all the time not sometimes all the time. so stop lieing to ever one you trust and be honest and tell the truth to every one. and if you are not honest people would never believe you.

People in this world lie alot and they are not honest. who are we going to trust if people are not honest .if you lie all the time people will turn their backs on you and nobody is going to help you out if you a problem. should we be honest or not? We should be honest because people that you know very well and you think that they would never lie to you thta's going to hurt you the must. and if you do what you said or promis people will believe on you and give you all of the trust that you need.

I know being honest can hurt someones feelings but insted of being sad make your wake ness in to streagth. and being honest breings good things in life you can get really great jobs and be responsible with everything .

if you are honest with everyone,evryone is going to believe you all the time. if you want to be trusted you need to start from zore. and be nice and don't get in trouble. and i'm telling you ,you will feel so much better then ever. you give all of your trust to that person and you say don't tell anyone, if that person does it anyways are you going to trust them again, I wouldn't. and if you lie to the people you love the most that's just sad because they give you so much incouregmentfor eveything.

I think that if you are not honest you shouldn't be trusted by anyone. and by being honest it can help you out by you'er parents having trust on you making sure that you don't do bad things or say bad things. some people can be mean when being honest but turn your back on them and don't talk to them but if they change give them a chance. and believe in everything on what you said. if people believe on you they're going to have your back no matter what.

"Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.

Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them.

Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.

It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.

Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Those were my .. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.

However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesn't have any and stays at home playing video games. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.

As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes",0
"If students are allow to use their phone in their classroom for educational purposes they could get distracted with the other apps on their phone. Having access to a cell phone in class could tempt the student to cheat on their class work or test. Cell phones are a big distraction for teenagers now days. Some teachers thinks that they should let their student use their cell phones for educational purposes while other don't. Not having their phone would push them to do better in the class. Also students could send each other answer through a text. All classroom should be a red zone just so students could put all their focus in school work. . Most of them can't go anywhere without their phone in their hands. Classroom should be a red zone at all time so students won't have the chance to cheat in their work.

Every student should be focus on one specific thing thing while they are in school which is to have good grades in their class. For example: Sanpchat, Instagram, Facebook, or even a text message. By being able to have access to their cell phone in class the student won't try as hard to keep their grade up. Cell phones could affect a student in their process of learning.

A cell phone can be a distraction for anybody specifically for a student. The student will have all their attention on getting their assignment done in time.

Some students know how to control them self while others can't. All of this apps could distract the student from doing what he or she is supposed to be doing in the class.

All students most do their own work at all time to show the teacher what he or has learned in class. Our cell phones could help us in many situation, but they can also distract us in many ways",0
"Even for teachers as well, teachers will be teaching students who really want to learn. Maybe art or music is not they're area ,according to newspaper ""CNN"" 's participation experiment graph, it compared to people who are interested and those who are not, and graph showed people who are not interested seems to loosing they're focus and even irritating them.

It's waste of time if they're not into it, they will eventually end up loosing interest.

There is no point of waste our precious time by doing things that we are not into it, obviously it's always privilege to take academic classes in school ,but it's not always the case. NO MORE LIMITTING!

Some people believe that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. For example, If they're applying colleges and they need some specific classes and credits ,they might want to take what they're needed other than art and music class because its simply waste of time.

It's unpopular, unnecessary, and unprofitable for some students.

Not every students are artistic person and want to take a music or art class. it will be beneficial for both of them.. we rather do something else that are more fun and more productive for us.

It is mortal for some students especially seniors.

If school is limiting and make require to take academic classes it is mortal for some students especially seniors, those who failed one or two classes and need to make up. But should students be forcibly required to take a music,a drama, or an art class?

Students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives.

Dont limit they're choice

If school start to limiting classes and require to take certain classes, this is truly ineffective for everyone.

All students have rights to pick what they're interested in, and what they need. If school make art and music and other academic classes as a elective, it will be more effective for everyone, because every students will have choice to pick what they really want or need. But because of school is limiting and make require to take academic class they couldnt graduate on time.

I strongly believe that students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives",0
"You know he is wrong.

Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you don't understand the information or don't have enough to back it up. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them.

If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure it's correct and the best. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. For example, when you're working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better. He couldn't give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test.

You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. More is better than one. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. This method can also help you with a project. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something that's completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didn't have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing it's more likely to be true than the one that doesn't. . You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. Maybe you just don't understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and that's what helped survive for so long. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting.

So, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person.

You should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem",0

"Some people prefer to rely on their own judgment and make these decisions independently, while others reach out to experts and authorities for guidance. 

Ultimately, it's important to consider both of these paths when determining the best strategy for making important life decisions. On the other hand, relying on one’s own judgment can lead to tunnel vision, meaning one could miss crucial information for making the best decision.

Those who seek advice from experts and authorities may have access to more information than those taking the independent route. On the other hand, relying on external sources can lead to a sense of lost autonomy and inability to make decisions on one’s own, and should also be weighed carefully. Knowing they've researched the issue from multiple angles and viewpoints can lead to a more informed decision with greater confidence. Both paths can have their merits and drawbacks.

Those who rely on their own independent decisions can benefit from their autonomy and sense of control. It can feel empowering to make decisions without being influenced by others, and ownership over one’s choices can boost motivation and increase satisfaction with the results. 
Making important life decisions can be a difficult task for many people. The right choice for an individual could be a balance of relying on one’s own judgment as well as seeking advice from outside sources.",1
"In another words, you have to keep yourself working all the time. Let yourself to be accomplishment in anything and you will be successful for ever.

When you keep yourself busy, you will never get board in your life. Why should you accomplish anything in your live? In another words, why should you finish anything in your live? You need to accomplishment to get your purpose. I know that some people will degree with me, but that's okay because everyone have different opinions, and my opinion was if you didn't work hard you will not get what you want. For example, In our school you have to do your work so you can success. If you don't want to get board, make your self create anything, keep your brain thinking in everything, play sports, believe in your self that you can accomplish anything in the world. Always work hard and keep yourself busy so you couldn't get boring. You will be proud of yourself too that you accomplished something in your life. Always do your work and finished so you can success. Do not get lazy anytime because if you got idle you will not be an accomplish person in live.

Everyone will be proud of you when you accomplish something. Always accomplish your work and get it done so you can be a successful person.        . Always do anything to until you accomplished and do not leave it until you finished. "" Don't work hard but work smart"". For example, I go play soccer so I wouldn't get board in my life. when you let yourself finish the work you will be successful. Keep yourself working out, study, driving, eating, so you don't get board of your life. For example, I worked hard last year in World history and Geography and I passed the SOL, my dad and my mom both of them were proud of me and the whole family were proud of me, so you have to being working all the time.

In my opinion people accomplish when they always doing something . Always work hard so you can get a good grade and you will be proud of yourself. Let yourself work hard, so you can accomplish you work and success in your life. When you success in anything you feel comfortable. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that, we have to accomplish in our life because when we will accomplish in our life we will get our goal, however, people might disagree with me, and they think that inactivity serve a purpose and that's not true.

It's a great thing to be successful in your live. The best thing in life that you done work and proud of your work. Being active all the time is healthy. When you done something in your life you will be successful, not boring, and proud of yourself",0
"The park was surrounded by thick forests, tall rolling hills, and sparkling streams. 

When I stepped into the Community Park, I was overwhelmed by how much there was to take in. The National Park was huge, and it was filled with remarkable sights such as towering waterfalls, snow-peaked mountains, and crystal-clear lakes. Overall, I was in awe of the park and enjoyed every minute of my exploration. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced before and I felt like I had stepped into a dream. Every experience was unique and special in its own way, and all of them have left me with a deep appreciation for nature and the great outdoors.. 

My last stop was the National Park. I was in awe of the beauty of the park and found it to be a great place for relaxing. The park was also filled with well-maintained walking trails, playgrounds for children, and even a few ponds for wildlife. I visited a Community Park in the city I lived in, a State Park in the countryside nearby, and a National Park in a remote region. It was a refreshing and calming experience, and I was mesmerized by the breathtaking views of the park. 
My first experience of visiting a park was an incredible journey through a variety of natural and man-made features. There were wildlife trails, wooden bridges, and plenty of picnic spots to explore. I was surprised by how huge the park was - extending as far as the eye could see. There was lush grass, an abundance of colourful flowers, and a wide range of trees and shrubs around the area. 

The State Park I visited was a more remote location, yet it was full of life and buzzing with activity. 

I was humbled at the beauty and magnificence of the parks I visited",1
"When you speak to just one person, there is a limit to how much they can help you since they only know what you tell them. 
Talking to multiple people about a difficult situation is often the best course of action. Doing so can provide you with a range of perspectives, create a support system, and give you more insight to the problem. Each person can offer a unique style of comfort or advice based on their personal experiences that can be beneficial to your situation. Ultimately, this can help ease the burdens that come with a difficult situation while allowing you to better address it.. 

Speaking to multiple people also allows you to create a support system that you may not get from talking to a single person. Additionally, having a conversation with more than one person can provide you with a diverse range of perspectives on the situation. This can help bring to light possible solutions which you may have never considered on your own, as well as reinforce the idea that you are not alone in tackling the issue.

Overall, it is better to talk to multiple people when dealing with a difficult situation. Through hearing different viewpoints, you may gain insight that can help you more effectively address the issue",1
"
When it comes to deciding on a college course or career path, the process can seem daunting. Don't be afraid to ask questions! Talking to students who have already made decisions on college courses or career paths can be a great way to learn from their experiences. Creating a timeline is also a helpful way to plan out your next steps and identify potential career options that are best for you. It is also important to investigate the resources available to students to help them during this process. That's why it is important to research the differences between university and college courses for different career fields and make a list of college courses available for various career fields. With the right resources and a clear plan, you will be well prepared to pursue your college course or career path.",1
"I""ll like to go to Spain just to play soccer with Messi,or any Professional Soccer player. I also want to feel how it felt to live like they did.

Imagen being were somebody lived at it would be really cool you can take pictures, maybe meet there friends, or uncles, maybe there could visit were they use to live at and give you a hug, or something. If i went to Spain the ""first"" thing i""ll visit is this one places were a soccer player grew up at. But the reason i 'll want to visit Spain is if i do good in soccer i can have a chance to become professional and have alot of money and help my parents. I feel like Spain would make a better soceer player i""ll have better training,food,house and you''ll meet new people,friends, and most likely to speak another lanuage. Spain has every nice weather and if i visted Spain I would go to the beach, and go see soccer teams.

I want to go to spain to see Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar or get my shoes or shirt signed by one of them. If i went to Spain i would love to train with a professional soccer club.

Spain would give u a chance to become a good soccer player that all i want .Mostly everyone became rich at Spain. The reason i would visit it is becasue i wanted to see how he grew up like and how it was like. Also because theres nice places you can visit like beaches , soccer stadiums, soccer team, professioanl soccer players mostly everything fun at Spain. where is one place i would visit ? I would like to visit spain! because i heard that spain has ""good soccer teams"". . I imagen me,and my parents going to watch a soccer game together, going to th beaches",0
"After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.

Last, people can feel more positive. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.

Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. Also people can feel more positive.

First, people can do better things. People can have a better future. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.

In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.. Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things",0
"techonolgy is evolving such as humans are evolving too. Today you can look everything up on the internet.

Technology might be a good thing and make life easier but it can alsow be used as a bad thing. in conclusion, I belive the limination of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives.. Technology has also made the world a safer place. Now days everything you need is only a click of a button away. however, today we have camers protecting our homes, stores have cameras to catch shoplifters. this makes life easier and better. Technology plays a big rol in education. before technology it was almost impossible to stop someone from breaking into your home or catching someone stealing. Other people use technology for stalking, or tracking someone.. on the other hand, technology can alsow be used as a bad thing. Technology can also be used for human traficking. I belive the elimination of human contact due to technology is a positive thing. you dont have to go to a library to buy a book to learn something. and for selling drugs. it could be used as a source of bullying. Now days thanks to technology you can talk to someone on the other side of the world and not have that time gap to wait for there response. Hackers can steal credit card information, your personl information, and other personal things. Technology has given us the privilage to be able to play a game with many people even though we are all far away. When tchnology was not as developed, you had to write a letter, mail it , and wait weeks for a response. On these websites human parts are sold for a big amounnt of money. The end of the day, i belive technology can be a very helpful tool for humans but it all depends on how one uses it. Many people use technology for hacking. Students have better education because of technology. there are many dar webs on the internet, also known as the 'BLACK MARKET'. we now have all types of camers for different things",0
"Graduating early also allows for increased college course work in the remaining time, giving students the opportunity to impress college admissions offices. 
For students considering graduating high school in less than the traditional four year time frame, there are several advantages and disadvantages of that choice to consider. Graduating early can be beneficial depending on the individual's goals and needs. The most significant advantage is cost savings; students can save up to half a year's tuition by graduating in three years compared to four. Ultimately, the decision is a personal one and should be taken into consideration with care.. It may be easier to get ahead in college preparedness through a three year plan, while maintaining the full high school experience and taking all the available classes may be the best fit for others. When it comes to college preparedness, this is an important factor to consider. Additionally, graduating in three years may leave students feeling as though they are missing out on a major part of their high school experience in the form of sports teams, clubs, and other activities.

In my opinion, students should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early before making the decision to do so. 

On the other hand, although graduating early will help save money, students who choose this route may not have had the opportunity to take as many classes as those who completed the traditional four years",1
"For example, I know a lot of people that that do classes in the morning and at night time to catch all the work for the classes they hard. This helps all the opportunity for them to understand the learning. The classes you do to understand all the things that happen in each course to help out all. My prompt say that district school offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Doing everything done with work at school can get ready for everything to be done.

Do students do online classes and night school right now? If so, how do students get it done with all the activity and what programs they do to make it done. Early gradutes, yes, there's alot of them in the country to just get there education done with everything. The more work you get done during summer it counts your GPA scores. Having good grades and always in school that's one of the records to make college look at you and be like I want her to know to be in my college.

I will say that offer programs from different school you can get accept with all this around you because this can help you out with all the career you do in high school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                . That's why students graduate early. For me being a high school students all the elective classes I do helps me with the course I'm taking in college and doin online classes was the best way to get it done.

Programs you make in school and trying to be in it will help you with all the work you have. Graduating three years instead of four years you can get everything done. Do students do online classes and night school right now? Tutoring and and night classes and can help with everything you need in college.

Students that graduate early helps you to get ready for college. Some school offer programs for students to help them with there grading and work they make during the past school year. Colleges do look at your scores and work you do with all the information you do in school all the records and everything. Some students wanna do online class and night school to help them graduate and get there GPA for there classes for college. I remember all the year that I did all my best for high school I've done after school tutoring and morning tutoring to just get everything done so I can just graduate and help my family. Being orgizinize with all the work you do in school can help you with all the work you will do in college this is you being independent for everything you do in high school because teacher's helping you out. This oppoturniy graduating early helps me get ready for school.

Classes in school is hard because they helping you out to get ready for college, because when you enter college its very different than in high school because all the oppotunity you can make for your self",0

Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break",0
"If that's the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles it's unnecessary it could have been for something better. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatos with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinich. Sometimes the studentst doesn't make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so heathly choices. For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza.

It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. Even until this day they still don't change to a heathly choice. So it's okay don't waste on changing something when you knew it could of been done from the start. It wouldn't even matter if the school lunch changes to healthy food. Students has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasn't any difference. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it's not worst thing in the world. To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before it's not best thing in the world. Some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. Anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do.

In reality, it really doesn't matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still won't bring their own food how logical is that. We do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesn't even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. . Just bring your own food from home and you won't have worry about the school menu",0
"It is also important to acknowledge the potential obstacles of deciding a career at a young age. 
In our increasingly digital world, a career in technology has become increasingly attractive. In short, evaluating the possibilities and pathways that an individual can take in pursuing a career in technology is a beneficial endeavor.. There are several high school programs available to assist students with making informed decisions about their future and seeking out the career that globally best suits them. As many young Americans make decisions about their futures, it is critical to analyze personal interests and identify potential career paths in technology that best match those interests. Furthermore, focusing more on this issue may lead to even greater innovations that can shape our future. With job prospects continuing to grow, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of entering the field, as well as the unique pathways available to those looking to enter the technology industry. Nevertheless, it is beneficial to take a proactive and intentional approach to planning a career early, as it can have far-reaching implications for the future of the United States",1

Aesop said, No act of kindness,""no matter how small is ever wasted"" I think that what there trying to say is that no matter how mad you are or sad you can still find happiness or hope even if you lost someone in a family member it is ad but also just be a little happy that he is in a better place that he dose not have through any pain or suffering.

Aesop said, No act of kindness,""no matter how small is ever wasted"". Maybe you can be wrong but learn from your mistakes and try again.

Aesop said, No act of kindness,""no matter how small is ever wasted"". I think he is also trying to say is that dont let anyone drag you down do what you think is right and dont let anyone tell you that your wrong try to prove them wrong because you can do anything",0
"By exploring different industries, students can be exposed to the world-wide or regional problems that are being faced, and learn how they can apply their knowledge to create solutions. It also helps to encourage collaboration between a student and the local businesses, allowing them to interact with their potential colleagues in the future.

Furthermore, having local companies and organizations can give students the opportunity to sharpen their problem-solving skills. By challenging students to think critically and work within certain constraints, it helps to foster a problem-solving attitude which can be carried forward into their career.

In conclusion, having access to local companies and organizations is invaluable for every student. It can help to set their career path, give them the opportunity to explore the different professions available, and provide them with important problem-solving skills. Having the access to local companies and organizations allows students to engage with the curriculum in a meaningful way, create meaningful connections with teachers, and learn important problem solving skills. It can provide new insights and perspectives on their chosen field, and can give them an idea of what is expected from them once they enter the job market. It is clear that having these resources is essential in the development of every student’s career path.

Introducing students to local companies and organizations offers a real-world, hands-on experience for them to explore various professions. 
In today’s world, where early career development is essential to success, schools are being tasked to provide a way to help their students explore the different career options out there. It is essential that schools think carefully about how they can provide their students with access to this invaluable resource.",1
"It could also mean that they have less time with their children in the evenings, further limiting the amount of parental involvement in their child's education.

Ultimately, adding an additional 30 minutes to the school day could have a wide range of effects for students, teachers, and parents. 

The idea of adding an additional 30 minutes to the school day has a few obvious drawbacks. This could have a negative impact on after-school activities such as sports, music, clubs, and jobs, which could further limit opportunities for hands-on learning and socialization. 

From the perspective of teachers, the increased hours could create additional challenges when it comes to maintaining lesson plans, grading assignments, and providing individual attention. It is important to consider each individual perspective before making a decision on this issue, especially since it could have lasting implications for everyday life and scheduling.. On the other hand, it could also put a strain on students who already lead extremely busy lives and may not have the energy to stay in school longer each day. In addition, it could also create a scheduling conflict for teachers who work outside of the school environment.

For parents, an extra 30 minutes in the school day could significantly increase the cost of their child's education and may even disrupt the family's daily schedule. For students, it means that they would have to arrive to school earlier and stay later, effectively reducing the amount of time spent outside of school",1
"

Overall, having a good attitude can certainly help lead one to a life of success and fulfillment. This can lead to increased motivation and productivity, leading to more success. It is important to realize the power our attitudes have on our lives, and make sure to cultivate a positive outlook.. 
Having a good attitude can bring so many positive effects into one’s life. With an optimistic outlook, people are less likely to stress over the little things and experience lower levels of anxiety and depression. Lastly, having a good attitude can also lead to improved physical health. A person with a good attitude can make others feel comfortable around them while also communicating their own desires and needs. Moreover, having a positive attitude helps to build relationships with others. Here are three examples that demonstrate how having a good attitude can lead to success: 

First, with an optimistic outlook, one can stay focused on their goals by overcoming obstacles and setbacks. It can open up opportunities, cultivate strong relationships, and lead to overall success",1
"From the smartphone to self-driving cars, technology has rapidly developed and expanded our capabilities and spatial reach. As technology continues to evolve and progress, it is imperative to consider the consequences of its use, and to ensure it is used responsibly and in the right context.. 

Technology has also enabled people to be more efficient in their tasks and activities. Technology allows us to stay connected with friends and family, no matter how far they are away. It is also opening up opportunities to learn new skills in real-time that would have otherwise required formal education. However, when used in excess and with little self-control it can have a negative influence on our lives. Technology can provide rapid access to resources, information, and the latest news in an instant.

However, there are some potential negative impacts of technology that should be taken into consideration. Online shopping has allowed people to purchase virtually anything all from the comfort of their home. 

Overall, technology and science have been responsible for a number of beneficial advances in our society. 
Technological innovations have completely transformed the way that people work, communicate, and shop. Automation has made it possible to do mundane tasks in a fraction of the time as before. Information overload can lead to information fatigue, and lack of physical exercise as a result of device usage is known to have hazardous effects on our health. Excessive usage can lead to addiction, where users are unable to switch off or take necessary breaks",1
"Success consists of going from failure to failure until you get what you're being fighting for, without losing your enthusiasm. But, let me tell you something that you already know, the world isn't a rainbow it's a very mean and nasty place and it doesn't matter how rude you are, it would put you into your knees and keep it permanently if you let it. However i realized that the time period it's not the same to the one that we're living on. In addition to this, you have to be able to hold out the criticisms of others, if you are not capable your enthusiasm will get shrink and all the effort would be vainly.. Not you, not me, even no one hits that hard like life does. But, it does't care how it hits, the only thing that really cares is about how much you can take, how much you can get hit and keep moving forward. Eventhough failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. Company Association, Churches, and Governments are not alike as before, because now if you are trying to achieve something and for some reason you failed, people will start judge on your acts that you're not capable to become your dreams reals. We all passed through that situation , you feel like you're not lace in, in the directions that your boss or supervisor gave it to you to do and thanks to that some employees start laugh at you, about your failure and no one is loyal to come up to you and teaches you how to do it they stand by and wait until they see that you made it wrong then they try to help you. That's how winner is done.

In summary all the proofs plays an important factor in how to be successful in life, sometimes is that shove that you needed to get higher. In my opinion, i completely agree with this association church statement. I would like to share one specific example that fail is the promotion that brings you to success.

I would like to lasso the example of your first day on your new job. If you know what you worth, then go out and get what you worth, but you must have to be able to hold out hits and not to came and blame others and say; I can't be the person that i want to be, because of him or her, or anybody",0
"The more you explore the more you learn about life and where it will take you.. Explore beyond what you have mastered and there will alway be a suprise , a new talent and a new growth in life. Some enviroment make you satify where you at.

Being happy with where you at is not a bad thing but the more you explored the more you grow in life. You will never discovered your worth/talent with out trying. He is also right because where Iam from lot of people are satify where they in life life.

I believe that the more you explore the more you grow. I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because some people are comfortable where they are. My mom alway tell me never be happy where you at step out of your comfort zone and explored.

So you will know who you truly are. like Neil Armstrong Said "" a gaint leap for man kind"" some people need to take that gaint leap in their life. The more you explore the farther you go in life. And if

Barack Obama was satify with his education/knowledge he would never had became a Senator or the first Black

African American president of America and he was never going to be able to share is idea with America .So with out going beyond what you have mastered you will never know who you are and what you are cable of. For example If Bill Gate was satify what he master with out exploring he would had never become a billionaire and he would never discovered the microsoft. Without explore you will never know what you are cable of and you will never grow in life. Some people in college are comfortable having there master degree but scared to get their doctorate degree because they feel that having their masters degree is the stopping point of their learning skills and they are not smart enough to get their doctorare degree. Always pray to advanced to a new level not the level you have master. Some people have that mind set that if they explore they will never make it. Never be happy with who you are alway fight for a better future on a better life. It is alway good to go beyond your comfort zone and explore new thing. For example if your boss is leave and they are looking for a new replacement for his/her position and you have knowledge/idea about the job, but you decided embrace where you are because you are scared to take a step in life. It good to be satify where you are sometime, But when emergency come to need to explore to see who you truly are. And you also have the mind set that they will turn you down",0
"Other activities that can be enjoyed at the park include biking, jogging, walking, and swimming. Kids can play at the playground while adults relax and soak up some fresh air. It's no wonder visits to parks are so popular!. Some parks also offer gardens with statues and paths, perfect for taking a leisurely stroll. Spending time outdoors is a great way to reconnect with nature and get away from daily life. 
Going to the park is an enjoyable way to spend the day for all ages. Even if you don't have a lot of money, it's easy to spend an entire day without spending a dime. Parks offer a variety of activities that can be fun for the whole family. The possibilities are endless with a trip to the park! One of the best things about going to a park is that it's free. Taking a picnic and enjoying a nice lunch outdoors is a great way to take advantage of a sunny day",1
"With certain things it takes one of another to be with you through it to help you, Because it would depend on what you need to have done. There is people that i know that always worked hard for what they wanted in life and got what they needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           . I've helped lots of people get through on what they needed and sometimes its more of what has to be done.

People always need to help themselves because it would make them better in their life in my opinion. Its good to see people doing well because of the achievements they have decided to complete. The small things in life could be just done on its own without you or anyone having to do something about it.

So overall many achievements would be done if you are always working hard for it and could be better if you do more than what you're suppose to do. I have completed quite a few goals in my life because it was all i would put my focus to. I believe that many accomplishments could be done if you put your focus to it. Sometimes it may be finished on its own without anyone doing nothing about it. Such good things could happen to anyone. lots of amazing opportunities like you could get a good job, A new car, House or just anything that you would want in general. It's great to help yourself in life because you don't know how good it would turn out in the end",0
"but in some situation we can not do what we want? for example; I want to be a doctor and my family support me for that, but the problem is that I am trying to to learn and search something about human life but I can not, because it is hard for me. if I try my best and I study a lot. whatever we want we can do it but we need someone to support us in the any type of situation if it is bad or good. by asking someone about our problame maybe we solve it. so we should be do the thing what we want to do.. if we scare from the problem then we will not be able to do something what we want it before and we can reach it in the future. everything is possible.

for making a good life in this world is not that mach easy that we thing. if it is bad thing then he/she can tell me that it is bad and you can not do that stuff then I will never do that. by asking someone who have experience in the thing that we do not have. If we want to do something for ourselve so we need to finish high school and university. world is to big. If it is good thing then he/she can tell me and support me for doing that good stuff.

Everthing is possible in this world if we try and we should search about the thing that we do not know about it. take digree after all that I will take a good job and then I make a good career for myself and tehn I will be have a great life in nthe future.

sometime it is possible to do the thing what we want. I am agree, but sometime it is not possible to make something that we want. trying is best to have great life. i have a lot of goal to reach for those goals but I should try because it is hard for me. Yeah, he was right to be ourselve in world that is constantly trying to make us something else is the greatest accomplishment. We need to face to face every problems. There is a lot of thing that we want but we can not to have it. then I will be a good doctor.

If we do something for ourselve it will be good because we do the thing what we want it. It will be great to doing something good but we should discase with someone who is so close to us. Only in one condition I can reach for my goal. by searching I can change my life. I will try to make a good life for myself",0
"This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind",0
"If we don't show them what they need to do or like to do , they gonna lost outside the world . Are the student need to commit to a career at a young age ? Is it a good idea ? The answer is yes. Their course of study in high school will help them to choose what career they think they suppose to do. That's all of my opinion. They don't know what career they need to follow and they are not going to have a good job. So that we should teach them about career and guide they to the right way . I hope we don't make any mistake because everyone deserve a happy life. Today,we talk about the career for student at a young age. We gonna ruin their life indirectly. They have to focus to what career they choose and they gonna fathom out that career .Example ,when a student want to be a doctor when he grow up that's why he have to focus to learn well biology and all about the doctor's job. We love our student that's why we should support they to have a better life in the future. Thank you all.. They need to know what they want to do when they grow up",0
"It can be beneficial in terms of saving money on transportation and utilities, improving academic results, and allowing teachers and staff to gain additional professional development opportunities while school is not in session. Research and further discussion are needed in order to determine whether or not extending the school day two hours is a feasible idea for students.. 

Extending the school day two hours for students to gain additional academic instruction is an idea that is gaining traction. While this could be beneficial as it would provide additional instruction time, it would also mean that students would have to attend longer school days and would require more funding in order to staff the additional teaching hours. However, there are also some disadvantages to consider, such as added stress on teachers, students having to attend longer school days on the four days when school is in session, and limiting extracurricular activities due to the shortened school week. 
The shift to a four-day school week is becoming more and more common among schools across the country",1
"A student from a different country may not speak English. Students should not attend classes from home. Some parents think it is a good idea for students to stay at home for education. If a student is blind, parents would have to hire or contact someone to help that blind student at home for some help. Parents have to pay bills but what if the student needs the money for the classes.

Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home or by video conferencing. So, students will not be able to do any homework.

The second reason is students can struggle with homework. Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But wasting money on classes or books is not a good idea. What if the students have siblings, they might not have the time to do there work on time. Parents might have not have the money for the classes or for the books. Students should never attend distance learning for there education.. Students at home may not have any connection. Here are the three reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

The first reason is students are just wasting time at home doing work, but they are really just playing video games or watching T.V. Also Most of the students that are home schooled can easily get distracted from Cellular devices too. Most states have classes for free books or classes, but some other states might not. Parents may think it is a good idea for students to stay home for education at home. But what if students are blind and can not do any work at home. Students can focus on doing there homework or class work. That also can be a struggle for a parent or gaurdian because they might not be able to afford classes at home.

The third reason is wasting money on books or classes",0

Working in a group has numerous advantages, both socially and academically. The social aspect of collaborating in group work can also lead to the creation of lasting friendships. Moreover, working in a group can often help to ensure better results and a higher grade in an assignment or course, with everyone sharing the responsibility and relying on each other’s talents to reach a common goal.  In conclusion, the benefits of group work are many—from both a professional and a social standpoint. Working in a group also encourages team-building and helps to develop your communication skills, including the ability to actively listen and express your opinion in a respectful way. By working together in a supportive environment, there are many opportunities for meaningful conversations and shared experiences to be had—all of which can lead to lasting relationships. Doing collaborative work also means that more minds are working together to generate innovative ideas and finding creative solutions. From developing your creativity and communication skills to the potential to make new friends—group work has the potential to be highly rewarding.. With group work, you have the opportunity to meet new people, broaden your horizons and gain knowledge from others who may have different expertise than you",1
"Furthermore, the older student's presence in helping with service hours can give younger students a sense of purpose. 

Recent research has shown that older students in school can have a positive influence on younger students. All in all, having older students provide guidance and leadership to younger students in a school setting can have a number of positive effects.. This allows the younger students to relate to the situations better, trust the advice given and be more willing to try the tasks themselves. Additionally, there has been evidence that older students can act as mentors for younger students in areas where the older students have struggled themselves. For example, by providing guidance and advice, the older student can help lead a younger student through difficult subject matter or give them encouragement and direction when it comes to their academic work. With the sense of responsibility they get from helping, young students may become more invested in their school and academic work",1
"With the help of smartphones and other devices, people can access a plethora of information, meaning they have access to a host of tools and knowledge at the touch of a button. This makes tasks that would have otherwise been difficult or impossible not long ago significantly easier.

In conclusion, it is clear that technology can provide a substantial positive impact on people's lives. While the limitation of physical contact between people may be considered a drawback of technology, it is not the only possible outcome. 
In the modern world, technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives. For example, the introduction of automated machines has drastically reduced the amount of time needed to manufacture products. By reducing the amount of time required to do certain tasks and providing greater autonomy and convenience, technology has the potential to make life easier and simpler for everyone.. 

One distinct advantage to technology is that it reduces the amount of time needed to complete mundane tasks. Similarly, online banking services help people manage their finances faster through the convenience of automation. There are undeniable benefits to technological advancement, particularly in terms of reducing the amount of time needed to complete daily tasks and increasing our autonomy and convenience. 

Not only does technology reduce the time spent on tasks, it also provides greater autonomy and convenience to people's lives",1
"For example, when walking down the street, hold the door for the person behind you or say ‘good morning’ with a smile. Such simple gestures can go a long way in helping to strengthen a bond between two individuals, or even within a whole community.

No matter how small, paying it forward can brighten someone’s day. By remembering to take even the smallest opportunities to offer kindness and compassion, we can create a happier, more connected society.. One person’s positive reaction to a small act of kindness can help to spread joy to other people in their lives, and even around the world.

Therefore, it is clear that small acts of kindness can have a big impact on others. Showing appreciation for someone’s hard work or providing words of encouragement can leave them feeling good. A single smile, a pat on the back and a few kind words can have a big impact on the lives of those around us. 
In our increasingly impersonal world, the power of small acts of kindness can often be forgotten. From family members and friends to colleagues and complete strangers, we can make a difference in the lives of others through small acts of kindness.

Small acts of kindness can help to reinforce positive connections between people",1
"Finally, the government should provide incentives for students who choose to do community service beyond the required minimum, such as scholarship and volunteer awards.  

A potential solution to this issue would be to allow students to choose the type and amount of community service they take part in. By allowing students to customize their service, they can optimize their time to ensure both their academic and personal needs are met. Additionally, this solution would empower students to serve their community in a way that suits their interests and passions. However, community service can also teach valuable life lessons such as compassion, empathy, collaboration, and communication, which can have a positive effect on academic performance. 
After reviewing several studies on the pros and cons of requiring students to do community service, it appears that the primary concern is the potential impact on academic performance. By formulating this solution, students, community, and government can all benefit.. The students may be so focused on completing the service requirements that they neglect to focus enough time and energy on their studies",1
"Ultimately, this expanded school time could give students the edge they need to be more successful in their educational and professional endeavors.. Moreover, this additional school time could enable better preparation for tests and exams, giving students more confidence and greater assurance when setting out to ace their courses. Not only will it lead to improved educational outcomes, but it also provides access to greater job opportunities and improved test prep capabilities. Furthermore, more school time could lead to greater exposure to a variety of skills and subject areas that could be helpful in future jobs. By investing in more school time, students are better able to understand complex ideas, problem solve and cultivate creative thinking. 
Gaining an extra half an hour of school each day could be incredibly beneficial for students",1
"For example, if an individual can focus on learning each failure, then develop a method or strategy to attain success, he/she can conquer any challenge that they might encounter. 

It is essential to never give up and stay enthusiastic despite whatever struggles may occur. These qualities can help anyone achieve anything, even those individuals who may have felt that their ultimate goals and dreams were impossible. His example shows that success is possible, and that no matter how many times failure occurs, success can still be accomplished by channeling enthusiasm and never giving up.. Take the famous basketball player Michael Jordan for example. His skill techniques, knowledge of the game, and his hard work and dedication were the factors that enabled him to achieve success. 
Many successful individuals have triumphed despite innumerable failures. As long as a person stays focused and focused on their own enthusiasm, they will continue to try and have an optimistic outcome.

Michael Jordan’s story is a great demonstration of how success can still be achieved despite failure. Despite being cut from his high school basketball team, he remained enthusiastic and kept practicing until he moved forward and eventually became one of the best in the world. His determination and enthusiasm allowed him to change non-believers into believers and to achieve success",1
"
Having a good attitude in life is strongly associated to success and resilience when facing challenging situations. It gives us the courage to face difficult situations and helps us to channel our energy into productive tasks. 

Despite these advantages, there is a debate about whether having a positive attitude is necessary for success. Studies have shown that having a positive outlook on life can help us overcome adversity, and can ultimately lead to success. Positive thinking makes it easier to view a problem as a challenge, instead of an obstacle. Nonetheless, having a positive attitude in life greatly increases the chances of achieving both short-term goals and long-term objectives. 

In summary, having a good attitude is an important factor for becoming successful and achieving your goals. There is evidence that hard work, resilience, and talent are all equally important to attaining success. Moreover, research has shown that having a positive attitude can make it easier to focus on tasks and circumvent negative emotions. With a positive attitude we can reach our potential and achieve our ambitions.. It increases our capabilities to see opportunity, rather than danger, in the face of failure",1
"Studies have shown that interactions with others can lead to improved social, mental, and physical health, while activities such as playing catch, fishing, or flying a kite can reduce stress levels and lead to positive emotions. By taking the time to get out into nature with friends and engage in activities, you can reduce stress and improve your overall wellbeing.. Research suggests that spending time in nature and engaging in outdoor activities can lead to decreased stress levels, improved mood, and feelings of rejuvenation and calm. 
Playing outside can be great for your wellbeing - both physical and mental. In particular, spending time in nature with friends can be especially beneficial",1

EX: painting the sidewalk cleaning the beaches cleaning the street school helping people that really need are help like paralytic, oldest, veterans persons.",0
"With two additional hours of school, student fatigue and stress build up more quickly than before. Furthermore, after-school activities and extracurriculars would be more difficult to manage with a four-day school week.

Finally, it’s important to consider the practical side of the four-day school week. 
The idea of a four-day school week has been gaining traction among many school districts recently; the idea is that by condensing the school week into four days and increasing the amount of time spent at school during those days, the amount of time each student has to complete their schoolwork is increased. However, there can be major disadvantages associated with this schedule.

The main issue with the four-day school week is the length of the school day. This can detract from the quality of student learning in the long run. This presents a problem for lower income and tax-dependent schools.

A four-day school week with two additional hours of school can have many disadvantages that must be taken into consideration. While there is potential for more in-depth learning, some students may not be able to keep up with the extended school day. A longer school day also has the potential to affect our students’ health; some have argued that these additional two hours of school could lead to mental and physical exhaustion, headaches, and difficulty sleeping.

In addition, this schedule does not allow for flexibility in learning; some students may have difficulty handling different areas of the curriculum. While it may be beneficial in certain cases, there are potential problems that must be considered before implementing such a system.. Bus routes need to be adjusted, and many school staff such as custodians and cafeteria workers may not have jobs available every day due to the school closures on Fridays",1

"By developing a plan that takes into account both medical conditions and psychological needs, pediatric doctors can ensure the best possible care for their young patients.. To provide the best care, it is important to create a friendly environment for children in which they feel comfortable and secure. This can be accomplished through activities like patient education, preventive health measures, and providing a comforting atmosphere during appointments. These include medical school, a specialized residency, licensing, and ongoing continuing medical education. It is essential to have a genuine commitment to the well-being of children and their families, to ensure quality medical care. Working with children can be immensely rewarding; however, it can also bring about unique challenges. 
Aspiring pediatric doctors must complete a variety of educational and professional requirements",1
"Even having a daily basis of clients/ customers, even if its 5-10 people a day. A lot of people use their interests to get them out of bad situations, which brings me to my final paragraph.

Following your dreams and being true to yourself can take you a long way. Such as trends, for a couple of weeks, months or years. A majority of people in the world have made themselves who they wanted to be. Every persons interests can influence them more than any person or friend. Like different genres of, movies, music, or video games, even clothing. But as you get older, and the trend is over, most people regret spending a lot of money on things they didnt need. Although, I believe sometimes being around many different influences, such as religions, trends, and different cultures. If it wasnt for peoples interests, and wanting to be themselves whether they were accepted or not. We all choose our own traits.

Certainly, many different things can influence us. People like teens or young adults might feel terrible because their friends could be having those things and they cant afford it, and when they get some money they might go and spend it on expensive things to fit in. Many different things could be could be trending. After the trends die out and everybody moves on to the next set of trends. Others may think of starting a business with things they have a passion for and enjoy. I believe everybody chooses who we want to be at some point, it may take time but in the end, everybody finds themselves.. Many people who cant afford things of such nature such as the latest cars, jewelry, and brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Moncler, or anything of type nature that is trending. At some point if that person stays consistent and humble, something big may happen for them and their business can just become huge, and they could keep on growing and having people who also share the same interests could come in on a regular basis. Most famous people wouldnt be where they are today. Although when people think of chasing their dreams, they picture being rich, famous, and living in a mansion. In the moment when those things are popular it might feel amazing to own those particular things. People will start maturing and decide to wear, listen to, and do their own things, instead of being just like everybody else.

Most people, if not everyone would prefer doing things they like rather than doing things they dont like because their friends want to do it",0
"Being kind helps promote our mental and emotional well-being as it enables us to be more resilient and helps combat stress.

In a world where negative news stories are pervasive, making an effort to show kindness can help change the course of our day for ourselves and those around us. Giving of ourselves, in whatever capacity, pays off in the end; simply taking a moment to be kind to someone means we can be part of something greater. It is a simple yet powerful act that can have profound impacts. 
Showing kindness is an integral part of being a good person, and one that brings many benefits to both the giver and the receiver. Moreover, kind acts often lead to genuine relationships, further prospering the atmosphere around us. We can feel a sense of purpose, and of being part of something larger than ourselves, when we give of ourselves voluntarily. Therefore, the importance of showing kindness should not be underestimated.. When we give of our time, resources, or simply a kind word, we lift the spirits of those around us and bring joy to their day. Kindness can be shown in many forms; small kindnesses, like holding the door open for someone, smiling at a passerby on the sidewalk, and helping a neighbor with a task, can make an immense difference.

Kindness is self-serving too—it can brighten our own mood, create feelings of satisfaction and even boost our mood",1
"For example, student meets new person who does not look healthy body and the student guess the boy cannot play any sports by seeing his body, but people says that he is the best player on the team. For example, there is a man who is really big and angry face. The first impressions are almost impossible to change because when people meet new person, their personal information is only what is she or he looks like, so it is hard to change their first impressions, and people do not often change the first impressions.

Firstly, they find the first impressions and guess the person who is she or he because that is what human does every single time when people meet new person. For example, a student who is being mean to some friends. But some day, the student realize that it is not good to being mean to friends, so he shows the difference which is being nice to friends and helping people instead of being a mean person. Even if the student watch his game and he plays really good, it is difficult to change the first impressions because he still does not look like athletic person and the student knows how unhealthy he is.

Secondly, people do not often change the first impressions because it is individual opinion so they want to keep it in their mind. Sometime, people can change their first impression which makes the person feel better so the student can talk to easily.

In addition, it could be possible to change the first impression by showing difference between now and before. Everyone afraid of talking to him, but a student tries to talk to him and the student find out he is a nice person to talk. Although, the friends change the first impression of the person which makes both of them happier and be able to make better friendship.

In spite of these issues, it is still almost impossible to change the first impressions. Some day, he talks to his friends and find out he loves talking with people. But his first impressions are shy and not talking with anyone so people cannot talk to him because they are not able to change his first impressions.

However, some people could change the first impression as long as making a good relationship with a person who talks to. For example, there is a man who is very shy and show people that he does not want to talk to anyone, so people decide that not to talk to him. So everyone should not focus on the first impressions too much.",0
Sometimes its even better to ask someone for in advice that has had in experienced of something that you might not be experienced with like going through something rough people will understand you because the have also been like that or you just feel worry about something or because you are curious or interested about something and you want to know or want to try something new for the first time. Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone? Opinions can help people by seeing the persons point of view and understand the persons view. . Sometimes people need in advise to help them make a better choice sometimes people need advice to help to let them know in what they need to work on or improve on next time. When making a decision you need to think about will my decision effect others or myself? or does it benefits them or me? sometimes people need advise then they are making a decision because sometime when making decision it can be challenging. Sometime people want advice when they need help because they can't make the right decision or probably because they are going through something rough in there life. Sometimes its better to ask multiple people for in advice because everyone thinks differently and you will probably get more different advise from people because the more people you ask for in advise then you will get more advise from people. What does advice help people for advice can helps in many ways like to not give up in things people try not giving up so they use advice sometime people just need a motivation in advice that can also be inspirational to some people advice can be very inspirational and that can help them be success in the future sometimes people need advice to help them get motivated advise can be used in many ways sometimes you will probably not get the advice that you want from people but Seeking multiple opinion that can help them answer their question multiple opinion can help someone see the other person point of view and understand easily and know in what they need to improve on next time,0
"Although high school students may not have all the necessary skills and experience needed to make such a commitment, they should be given the support and resources they need in order to make an informed decision that could be beneficial for the rest of their lives.. 

However, it is understandable that some people believe high school students are not prepared to make such a life-changing commitment. Early commitment allows students to gain valuable experience and knowledge, as well as build relationships that can be beneficial throughout their professional career. They may not possess the mature perspective and analytical thinking needed to make smart decisions, and then be held to it. Additionally, they may not have enough experience to truly appreciate the full scope of the career they are committing to.

In conclusion, for some high school students, committing to a career at a young age can be an advantageous decision. Additionally, those who start a career before graduating from high school are more likely to have successful job prospects after leaving the educational system. It gives students an opportunity to gain valuable experience, build relationships, and allows them to establish themselves in the professional world before graduation. Research has shown that early career commitment boosts students' confidence levels, allowing them to take more initiative in their studies and working to reach a higher level of academic achievement. 
Making a career decision before finishing high school can be intimidating to many young adults, but starting early can also have significant benefits",1
"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you don't want to end up one day behind bars.

Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. For example, when you're angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasn't right. Meaning that, it's most likely for you to have a positive mind. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life.

Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. It can help you in many ways. Sometimes it's better to make the right choices because it releases our stress.

Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someone's help.                                 . People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life.

Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. I was so mad that I wasn't thinking right. That's the time to express your feeling to someone else. I remember when I decided to break my friend's trophies. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but it's the complete opposite. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done",0
"
Graduating early can be a very beneficial way to further a student's education or career, but there are some potential risks that should be considered. On the positive side, graduating early can allow a student to jump ahead in their college or job career. They may lack the polish and be behind in certain skills needed for the next journey. However, potential risks and drawbacks must be weighed against the potential advantages to make an informed decision.. It may enable them to start their career earlier, or even give them the opportunity to pursue further education or specialized courses.

The drawbacks, however, can be significant. They would also miss out on the networking, connections, and experiences that would help them further their education or career.

In conclusion, graduating early can be a great way to benefit a student's education and career prospects. Early graduates may not be as prepared as their peers for the next step in their career or education",1
"Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

It's obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others",0

Higher GPA requirements provide an incentive to remain academically focused, while ensuring only students that are doing well in school are participating in extracurriculars. 
After researching how other school districts handle the Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements for extracurriculars, it is clear that district policies vary significantly. Keeping such a balance is important to ensure that students have the best educational experiences, and are able to make the most of their learning opportunities.. There are benefits to each approach. 

Weighing these pros and cons, it seems that the school should strive to keep its current GPA policy not too high or too low. Doing so allows the school to maximize the benefit of extracurriculars while still encouraging students to remain academically successful. At the same time, too low of a requirement can be counterproductive, as students may end up focusing more on extracurriculars than academics. Some districts set low GPA requirements in order to open extracurriculars to larger numbers of students. 

Lower GPA requirements open extracurriculars to more students, enabling them to benefit from the positive activities and social interactions these activities provide. Other districts set higher GPA requirements in order to ensure that students remain academically successful. However, setting such high requirements can limit the number of students who are able to participate and deny them the opportunity to benefit from extracurriculars",1
"I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for example

They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers

They can teach how to welcome people

It also helps them to have a great future

The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future and they can also help their families and other families. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example

United Kingdom

Norway

Sweden

Denmark

Canada

And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It can also be a great hobbies for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example

Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor

Help an old person cross the road

Teach kids how to write neatly

This kind of program could help the environment so much.  ",0
"However, the ability to work productively with a group of individuals can result in more meaningful outcomes than attempting to go solo. Additionally, dividing tasks amongst members can help to reduce the stress associated with the project.

Although working together can come with its own set of challenges, such as managing interpersonal conflicts and ensuring that everyone's voices are heard, the benefits of collaboration far outweigh the challenges. Having a variety of perspectives can provide a well-rounded outlook and can help to motivate and inform one another.

Group work can increase the efficiency of a project. 
A common misconception is that one can achieve more on their own than they can in a group setting. By pooling together different experiences, knowledge and skills, a team has the potential to capitalize on strengths that a single person may not possess. 

Working collectively enables us to learn from each other, identify new ideas and gain different perspectives. By working together, we can reach new heights and accomplish far more than any one of us could have achieved on our own.. It creates the potential to engage and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, who can bring valuable experience and reasoned insights. Working together allows for the division of labor, which can help reduce the workload and produce better quality results in a shorter period of time",1
"Generic_Name's girlfriend or friend would always takeover Generic_Name. We are not perfect, but we could try or at least act like we can be. You cannot go back in time, but you can move on and make a change in your life. You made a mistake? You all shall learn from it. It was a Thursday and Me and my friend Generic_Name were on our way to work, I was driving when all of the sudden he starts screaming like if he was having some sort of a seizure. Years passed, I noticed that he has changed. People can change,and we all make mistakes. Do you believe failure could lead up to a better person? Shortly, I am going to discuss as to why making mistakes is necessary for a person to become a better human being. That leads up to a person who is selfish, mean, and has a cold heart. Making right decisions should help you become a better human being for its future community, country, and even the world.

I personally strongly agree with Churchill's statement. When a person makes mistake he's/she's is more likely to learn from its mistake. He is not the sweet boy with the good heart anymore. Till the day came, sooner than what we expected. However, not all person learn from their mistakes in the first time, some take longer than others. He now knows when to say NO and when to say YES. In conclusion, a better person makes a better future for its world. "" NO how could you do this to me"" he said. Therefore, you should always look back at what you did wrong and always fix your mistakes. The day that he will never forget. However, that does not mean you cannot change it or fix the mistake you did.

Mistakes are mistakes. He tells me that he was on snap chat just chatting and looking at snaps when all of the sudden he sees his ""girlfriend' kissing another man. ""What happened?"" I asked. However, little do they know they're hurting people because they decide whats good for them and whats not good for them. Thats how good my friend's heart was. People make mistakes all of the time in their lives. Fix it. She would tell him what to do and how to do it, she was the man in the relationship. I tell him to relax and to let it go that she was not worth his time. Love everyone because you only live once in this life.. He now learned from the mistake he did, which was to let his girlfriend controlled him. However, we shall learn for the better.

In Conclusion, I would like to give an advice to all people to never give up. Make of yourself a better self being and be and example for all others. Mistakes are a problem, and problems can always be fixed.

Once upon a time my friend Generic_Name had a girlfriend, Generic_Name. He was a good kid with a good heart, therefore, that led to people takeover him easily. She knew she could trust Generic_Name because Generic_Name loved her like he never loved anyone else. Learn from what you did wrong an improve yourself. A person should not always be right, some people think that by doing what pleases them they are doing good. He calms down, breaks up with her and moves on",0
"later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun.. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. either he will get a get a good job or he'll stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. you can do good or bad. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. within you knowledge comes you imagination. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money.

young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. sometime even when you are reading a book. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend",0
"On the other hand, individual work can foster autonomy, a higher degree of creativity, and focus on specific tasks. 
Working in groups or working alone both have their distinct advantages and disadvantages. Experiences can change an individual's perspective on which approach yields better results. Ultimately, the decision of which approach to take depends heavily on the individual. A person who was successful in completing a project on their own might find more solace in individual work, while a person who was part of a successful team project may favor the benefits of working in a group environment.. On one hand, working in groups can provide support, collaboration, and the potential for great ideas to come out of open discussion",1
"Maybe

This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime

Many student don't like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I don't think so because we have help of all teachers. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience.

In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more. In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they don't pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life.

Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you.

For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. Study is more important, the place is not important beacuse when the person want to be someone like a professional in the future they need study much.",0
"Although some say that is not a good idea that students commit to a career at the young age because when they get to school and they when to a class and sit they will file very tire and will say that is why I did not whants to gets the career because I ready no that will afeck my class and I am not sleeping nothing at the nigh, actually is a good idea for students to commit a career at the young age because they can see that when they get they career they are going to see that the life is very hard and they can try to fix it by working and helping there family wit other things , and they can buy what ever they wants if they shoes a good career that is helping them and it will continue helping there future.

However does that believe that is not a good idea that students commit at the young age one reason is that they will file tire , because when they want to pay atention to math class and they see that the teacher is talking to much they are going to say no I want to sleep to to be in this class borring,second when they are in the corridor study for a quiz and they will be talking about the career and when they are going to take the quiz they will know nothing because they did not study .

Does who believe that is a good idea for students to commit a career at the young age give one reason ,one reason is that tey can see can the life is very hard and they will have to do there own thing ,second is that they can buy a car so because if they shoes a good career they are going to resif a lot of money so can have a car and help there family with other thing at home .

Finally that career it have to be good some you are not going to be looking for another commit career because you try hard and ask you family and teacher to help you to fun a good one, second if you like that career you most talk wit you mom or dad that you are happy with that and tell you teacher that help you to found that career and tell her can you will talk to other students to come and talk to the teacher so she can help them .

Inconclution people shoud agree that students can commit a career because it will help other students that are in High School and wants to be someone in the future they vere found what career do they want to work or study for ,second they will feel for good if they get the thing by there own ,thrid if they are traying to make something in their country their very try to talk to someone a friend or other person that can help them ,finally they can get more oportunity if they study hard and them founf they career that they wants .",0
"You need to practice regularly in order to ensure that you can play the instrument comfortably and develop both musical and technical skills such as knowing fingering positions, posture, and having an overall command of the instrument’s sound.  

I eagerly signed up for violin lessons. As I conducted research into the instrument's history, I developed an even greater appreciation for its extraordinary heritage and the history of its renowned composers. 
Growing up, I was entranced by the beautiful sound of the violin—a classical instrument which has been in existence since the 16th century in Europe. Neglecting practice can lead to slipping technical ability, as well as a loss of confidence and motivation. However, I soon realized that learning to play the violin is an incredibly taxing process that requires immense dedication, time, and focus to become proficient. I was enchanted by the complexity and range of emotion that the instrument could convey when played skillfully. Today, I am able to take immense joy in playing the violin, something that I never imagined I would be doing.. Through this experience, my attitude and perspective on the violin shifted from a source of struggle to a place of peace and comfort. 

My first experiences taking violin lessons were humbling. Despite the initial difficulty, I saw firsthand the sheer joy of mastering a new piece and was inspired by those around me to push my limits and strive to get to the point of being able to perform confidently.

At the same time, I realized the detrimental consequences of not practicing regularly. I was surrounded by much more experienced and knowledgeable musicians, yet the teacher was patient with me and helped me gradually become more comfortable and confident with the instrument",1
"Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. Working in a group can be helpful. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince I'd rather work alone. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time.

Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. But thats a whole different story. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldn't have been blamed for.

So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good",0

Schools should offer an after school homework club in order to support students and their academic success. 

First, an after school homework club would give students more access to the resources they need to complete their assignments. It would be a great place for students in need of tutoring or help with their homework to find the assistance they need. It would be a space for them to talk to their peers over a common interest or goal -homework- instead of a distraction like social media. In addition, it would allow teachers to observe student progress in a less formal setting, and provide better feedback on students enrollment and test taking performance. The club would provide a place for students to complete their homework with the help of their peers and staff. This would allow them to move past any challenging subjects and have the ability to learn more effectively.

Second, the club would provide more contact time with teachers that can provide above and beyond instruction. This would be beneficial in allowing students to find support from their friends and allow them to gain confidence and self-esteem.

Overall, an after school homework club would give more access to the resources needed, a chance for more contact with teachers, and provide a community support system. There are three points to consider when advocating for an after school homework club: access to the resources needed, more contact time with teachers, and providing a community support system. This open environment would allow students to get the one-on-one help they need to understand course material. These reasons make it essential that schools must offer an after school homework club to ensure the success of their students.. 

Finally, the club would provide a community support system for students",1
"Positive thinking is the practice of choosing to focus on the good rather than the bad in any situation and thereby engage with life more positively and productively.

When we choose to focus on the good in a situation, our stress and anxiety levels tend to decrease. Positive thinking can help us look at problems from a different perspective and push us to pursue solutions. Positive thinking has been proven time and time again to be a key component of achieving both short-term and long-term successes, from more mundane everyday accomplishments to reaching our biggest dreams. This can also increase our emotional intelligence, which in turn can lead to better communication and relationships with those around us.

Furthermore, positive thinking can bolster our self-confidence and encourage us to pursue opportunities for growth and advancement. Knowing that we can take on challenges, that we can push our limits and still come out on top, is a powerfuliumph of positivityhedge courage in our own capabilities and can be hugely motivational. 
It is often said that attitude is everything, and this is especially true when it comes to success in life. Striving for success is so much easier when we’re not constantly putting ourselves down and expecting failure.

Ultimately, choosing to maintain a positive attitude is one of the most important steps we can take towards a successful life. This can have a profound impact on our mental health and the ability to cope with challenging situations. To embrace the positivity potential within ourselves and our experiences is to open ourselves up to the possibility of a life full of growth and accomplishment.",1
"If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.

Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.

At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. Students and teachers have important roles in their life. They will know what kind of project to create. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. If they need it because they can loose their job.

Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone",0
"This will also effect their grades. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. That is why having f our-day work week is a bad idea. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it.

"if you don't be honest life will make you feel stressful by hiding all these things your hiding from people so you do not wanna hide anything from the people u love or care for.

In conclusion, no one questioned the honesty of the judge's statement. . instead those people out there hating you and talking behind your back almost everyday. Also, people will say bad names to you like your all lies, your not trustworthy, and your dishonest so if you don't want anyone in this world to call you these names be honest at all times.

Then, being careful and saying sorry to the things u told people that was a lie instead of being dishonest changing that honesty i say that people start thinking your real and wanna be friends with you. For example, Generic_Name dating her best friend boyfriend secretly. you could break there hearts by not telling them somethings if the situations important that they most know. so that why i believe honesty is the best policy sometimes even if u might hurt a person feelings.

First, not stealing, cheating because people will not have respect and lose trust for you. In my opinion i agree honesty is the best policy sometimes, however, honesty might hurt a person's feelings because the quality of being truthfulness is the key through out life. sometimes you could end up in bad situations and problems. so if u do these things it could change you as what type person your now then back then and it will change how people act towards you or behind your back most of the times.

Next, not hiding anything frank from people. For that reason to support my answer your being trustworthy is better than done or obtained without lying to that person. like you don't wanna hide anything from the people you love or care for you always wanna be honest with them no matter what. so these are my main reasons to support why i agree with this old proverb says honesty is the best policy. hurting them more when you lie to them then be hundred percent honest with that person. so i feel like if you do these things i least own up to your problems by being honest by saying you did this or this happened",0
"for example who has the cotrol in the hosptal? the doctors or who has the control on companys? the ceos. They think failure is the end of the carrer. The reson why they have the control is they are more succesful, or more educated, or they are powerful. I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because, the more the try the more experiance they will get, they will get more power, they can cortrol people, and they will get freedom and respect.

Most of people are scared of losing or failing. . Another exapmle if someone has a company he will have the most cotrol because he'll be the most powerful person in the company.

The last thing you will get is the freedom and respect. For example Bill Gates is a powerful man in business do you think he will be in debt? the answer is no it will never happend because if he lost everything he made other people will help him to success again and everybody want to work with him.

Then, you have to have a control because you don't want other people to tell you what to do. Also i tried Bitcoins and because i joined late i lose $7,000. As a business man what i mean by freedom is you can go where ever you want when ever you want, and what i mean by getting recpect from people are two ways the first one is when you are more educated than them and when you make more money than them.

At the end success is like the marathone, you don't want to be the first preson who get it but you want to enjoy it. For example most people when they fail in business they give up, or some people don't try things because they are scared of the unknown.

One of my mintor alwasy telling me the more you try the more experiance you will get. But i never said i'll quit, what i did is i got a mintor his name is Generic_Name, he is doing real estate and i leanred a lot of things from him and one of my friends is good on bitcoins so i asked him to teach me and he became my mintor.

After you get the experiance you will get power and what i mean by that is it will be hard to fail. For example i tried many types of business and i failed on some of them like i tried to do real estate i brought a house and i lost $50,000 because i didn't know how much the house worth",0
"This can be especially useful when working in a team, and can help create an environment where everyone can learn and grow. 
Setting a good example for others is a powerful way to influence their behavior. Moreover, setting an example has the potential to have a ripple effect; if we take the time to lead by example, we can encourage others to lead by example as well, creating a sense of shared responsibility and a stronger sense of community.. When we take responsibility for our own actions, demonstrate honesty, and show respect for those around us, those qualities can begin to proliferate among our peers",1

"Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           . The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them. I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. In conclusion i think it's a good idea that the school can give the benefit for student's to take online classes so they can get the help they need. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. For example if a parent see's his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time",0

Sometimes in life it is easy to get carried away with the idea of being someone else. Conversely, when one is dishonest or attempts to be someone else, those relationships suffer and trust is often lost. In a world that is constantly trying to define and make someone into something they are not, it is essential to stay true to oneself and develop self-acceptance, which can lead to a more rewarding and fulfilling life.. On the other hand, being true to one's self and staying in touch with one's own goals and values offers long term benefits, potentially even leading to true and authentic friendships. 

When one is honest throughout their journey, relationships with others tend to thrive and love is shared in a meaningful way. However, taking this approach can be detrimental in the long run and can lead to unsuccessful accomplishments. We may look to others for inspiration, and it can be tempting to emulate them in an effort to be accepted by others or have a false sense of accomplishment",1

"Furthermore, it tends to be easier to focus and work more diligently while at home, as there are fewer distractions. Ultimately, the decision of whether to work from home or in school depends on the context and individual needs of the student.. On the other hand, school provides more structure and face-to-face guidance, which can be beneficial for certain types of learning such as verbal debates and group interactions. Working from home may be easier in terms of accessibility to resources, as students can easily access the internet to find the information they need.

Working with a group can offer a number of benefits. Additionally, working alone can often provide a greater sense of autonomy and creativity.. Working as part of a team can also lead to better communication and collaboration skills. 

On the other hand, there are also advantages to working alone. Without the need to coordinate schedules or consider the needs of others, you have the freedom to organize and structure time in whatever way you feel is most productive for you. Sharing the workload can make for a more efficient use of time and resources, as well as providing multiple perspectives and increasing creativity.

Working in a group has many distinct advantages over working alone. Additionally, being in a group provides valuable perspective as we can gain insight from hearing different ideas and opinions from our coworkers.

Moreover, working in a group is often more enriching than working alone as it can be an opportunity to meet and engage with new people from different backgrounds. Working collaboratively with others teaches us how to communicate effectively, become better listeners, and understand different approaches to problem-solving. We can learn about different cultures, beliefs, and even different methods of problem-solving that would be otherwise unknown to us.

Some people can change to not speak with no one because is not use self speak with someone you don't need to do. How to meet some people in many way in online or outside and to not speaking to another person like going out you cant speaking with a person in the shop, library, and going to play something to do outside. If you like to meet someone who you don't know speaking to the person, and before to to the person look at him or her, and be nice the him or her.

One of the biggest obstacles to asking for or giving opinions is fear. It can be nerve-wracking to approach people and open up to criticism, but taking a measured and prepared approach can help ease some of those worries. By listening to varying perspectives, we can open ourselves up to new ideas and ways of thinking, ultimately leading to improved outcomes. We can also become better communicators, better listeners, and better people overall.. 
Asking for and receiving opinions from others can be a difficult endeavor, but when done with the right mindset, it can provide invaluable insight and significant benefits for finding solutions to problems or making important decisions. It involves being able to identify valuable feedback and sift through information to draw meaningful conclusions. Start by thinking through what you want to say beforehand and practice conveying your thoughts in an organized and concise manner. By taking the time to ask for and receive opinions, we can gain a better understanding of the situation at hand and come to a more informed decision. Once this is achieved, it will be easier to come to an informed decision based on a variety of sources. This will help ensure that your opinion is thoughtful and well-received. 

Having the ability to effectively communicate is an important skill, and it goes beyond simply asking for and receiving opinions. 

The process of gathering opinions and feedback from others can be a tricky one, but the rewards are great and the benefits can be seen in many areas of life",1
"The idea alone of someone truly believing that you can be successful with a positive attitude is a joke,if anything the person believing a positive attitude is what makes them successful isn't in on the joke they are the joke.

Similar to a positive attitude a negative is never a guarantee to a successful life at least with a negative attitude you won't see the world in rose colored glasses if anything you see it for the harsh reality it truly is rather then doing pointless things to make life just a little bit more worth your time rather then forcing a positive attitude just to take in the world easier. Its a bittersweet reality on those who constantly maintain a positive attitude those kind of people are taken advantage of their kindness and will often be misunderstood with the people around them. In my eyes its just some facade we all have the ability to put up but some choice to live in la la land while others live in the real world dealers choice really.

Our attitudes is just one thing that can change the course of our lives the real way we make it in life is how we do so with our decisions towards that successful life that everyone desires. The real way to live is to have an iron will that shows that you are not someone to be messed with but, someone who is respected and can hold their own with making heavy decisions rather then keeping it all happy go lucky.

The debate about whether or not a positive attitude or a negative attitude can make you successful in life is kinda of like those other world debates about what happens when we die, is there life other then humankind, is there really a god. A positive attitude is what we expect in everything and everyone whether it be from;a customer service employee,teachers speaking to sporadic students,and or a bus driver driving a bus full of disrespectful kids. Its all based on interpretations or our upbringings into this beautiful disgusting world that is life you can be born with a sliver spoon in the mouth with a negative or born in a war torn country with a positive attitude its not about how we should make a successful life with attitudes its about how we make of it.. The saying that nice guys finish last is one heck of an understatement in the least, you could be the most positive person on the planet and still have shortcomings when it comes to a successful life .

A positive attitude is just what it is, it doesn't guarantee anything sure it might be helpful when getting the things you want in life but it can only go so far in within its own limitations whether it be giving and employer a positive attitude during a job interview of a job you've always wanted while ignoring how severely under qualified you are in the field. The lessons they burn in your head as a kid is that a positive attitude can take you places beyond your wildest dreams and those who have a negative attitude will have a unfortunate future brought upon themselves, in all honesty through my words I don't believe a positive attitude can lead to a successful life its our decisions in the making that do decide it instead",0
"On one hand, technology has done wonders to bridge the gap between different cultures and facilitate cross-border economic transactions, yet technology can also create limitations in human contact. 

When it comes to mental health, technology limits on human contact can have both a negative and positive influence. 
Advancements in technology have revolutionized the way that societies interact and can be considered a double-edged sword. Alongside this, technological advancements are also altering economic transactions, as an increasing number of businesses are turning to online platforms to better communicate with their customers. Consequently, it is necessary to evaluate the positive and negative effects of such restrictions on physical and mental health, social relationships, and economics. 

In terms of physical health, technology-induced limits to human contact may lead to a decrease in physical exercise and, consequently, in overall fitness. Conversely, virtual connections may promote healthier relationships since users can virtually communicate with peers, thus reducing physical danger associated with face-to-face interactions. 

Lastly, social relationships are affected in both positive and negative ways by technological restrictions on human contact. On one hand, too much reliance on technology can result in feelings of isolation and loneliness, yet virtual conversations may also provide an emotional outlet and promote engagement with others. For instance, virtual communication can facilitate social support, yet can also replace many meaningful interactions that would typically occur in-person, thereby diminishing human connection. 

In conclusion, technological limitations on human contact may have both positive and negative effects on physical and mental health, social relationships, and economic effects. Consequently, careful consideration and evaluation must be taken in order to maximize the benefits of technology while curtailing any potential detrimental effects.",1
"Asking advice from an informed and experienced individual is key, however, it is also important to keep in mind that every individual has their own perspectives, biases, and interests that can influence their opinion. 
Seeking out multiple opinions when making a choice can be extremely beneficial. Additionally, it can be beneficial to talk to multiple people, as different people have different points of view which can give you a more comprehensive outlook. By obtaining opinions from a variety of people, we can have a more complete understanding of the pros and cons of any given decision. 

In conclusion, seeking out multiple opinions can be extremely beneficial, especially for major decisions. They may also have their own preconceived biases and interests that could influence their opinion.

So how do we find someone with reliable advice? It can be useful to look for individuals who have walked the same path as you or have expertise in the domain you are seeking advice from. For example, when it comes to making a major life decision, such as where to go to college or what career path to pursue, having several perspectives can help an individual make the best informed decision for themselves. On the other hand, depending on the advice of only one person may not be as helpful because they may not be aware of all the facts and implications involved. Furthermore, it is essential to use your own judgement when making the final decision.. Finally, it is also important to use your own judgement when it comes to weighing the different opinions as each individual’s values, experiences, and goals are unique to them and you may not agree with every opinion. This ensures that the advice you get is based on first-hand experience and knowledge",1
"I have persevered through the times of struggle and silence the voices of doubt that try to get in the way. Life can be hard, and there will always be setbacks. Every obstacle I faced was an opportunity to show resilience and learn from any mistakes. It is something that I strive to remind myself of every day, regardless of the situation. Ever since I was young, I was encouraged to imagine and follow through on my goals, no matter how difficult or improbable they seemed. I have always been driven by the belief that if I work hard, then I can achieve whatever I set my mind to.

My biggest motivation has been my family. But if I maintain my focus and continue to stay on course, I know I can fulfill my goals and achieve success.. The unfaltering support and unconditional love they have shown me have been fundamental in my journey to realize my dreams.

I have made numerous sacrifices to work towards my goals. 
My life has always been dictated by my dreams and ambitions. I have chosen to take risks, challenging convention and pushing the boundaries for myself. I have refused to give up despite any opposition, and I see this as a personal strength that I will carry with me on my path to greatness.

The importance of persevering and not giving up on my dreams is something I value deeply. They have taught me that no matter what obstacles I may face, I can always pick myself up and keep going",1

Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related.

However noeveryone agree. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons.

Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. Thomas Jefferson said. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen.

In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides",0
"Without imagination we cant think and when we cant think we cant learn or solve every day problems. Thats why I think imagination is more important than knowledge.

We all know knowledge is very important but with out imagination we cant think or read because imagination is the key to knowledge. Do you think imagination is more important than knowledge? Well have you ever wonder how the first computer was made or how the first lightbulb was made? It all started with a imagination, if the person who made a lightbulb never had a imagination of building a lightbulb we will be using candles for a source of light. Lets say imagination was never a thing we wont know how to read or count to 10 because imagination is the key to knowlege Without imagination we will be having a lot of problems like how to comunicate, read, think, or even count to 10 thats why imagination is important.

With out imagination we as people cant make new things like books, art, or even better things thats why imagination is very important in may ways. The reason we have cars books and computers is not because knowledge but because of imagination. Thats why Imagination is the key to knowledge.

Imagination is very important, why you may ask, well with out imagination we cant think of new ways to solve problems or read. Imagination is the key to making new things like cars, phones, computers, books, with out imagination we wont have things like cars, or phones. Anything is possible if you can believe and think. It takes alot of thinking to make new and helpful things. Knowledge did not just exist like that is was made how? By imagination thats why why learn and do things.

Imagination is why we as people are advancing and getting smarter every day. How a about google, snapchat or even, books it all started with a imagination",0
"For this reason, it is important to obtain wisdom and experience from a parent or guardian.

For the younger generation, the guidance of a parent or guardian can help them make wise decisions, especially during times of adversity. While a young person might be more independent, those with parents or guardians to help guide them on their journey will have a much greater chance of success and fulfillment in life.. Throughout our lives, as we experience the highs and lows of life, wisdom and experience from those who have gone before us can be invaluable. With practical wisdom and life experience, these mentors can help advise through difficult decisions—from the small but significant ones in teenage life such as career choices, to the bigger life decisions such as sorting out relationships and financial management.

Finally, as children become adults, having someone with experience to act as a sounding board to discuss career opportunities, sports, social situations, and relationships, can be key to making wise choices. A parent or guardian who is wise and experienced can help a young adult tap into their strengths and teach them how to find and develop wisdom.

To sum up, wisdom and experience from a parent or guardian can be invaluable. 
The world is a complex place and, oftentimes, there is no better guide through life than a loving parent or guardian",1
"This would allow me to gain an insider's perspective on the world of theater and discover what opportunities I may have as an actress.

From the actors to the directors to the set designers, I would be able to gain insight into the rigorous process involved in putting on a show. Although I have seen some incredible performances in the movies and on television, there is nothing like experiencing a live performance in person.

The Art and Performance Center provides a unique experience with its combination of lectures, workshops, and performances. I could also take part in a variety of workshop and master classes taught by well-known performers and directors.

"It is important to remember that success is not a destination, but a journey. 

Other successful people, such as NBA star Dwyane Wade, have proven that a positive attitude is necessary for true success. Therefore, attitude should always be considered an essential part of the success equation, and people should strive to remain positive in all situations.. For example, Marianne Williamson, a renowned author and teacher, believes that the most crucial ingredient for success is a positive attitude. 
Attitude is a powerful indicator of success. She asserts that attaining a successful life is more about attitude than aptitude, and encourages people to live every moment with positivity and gratitude. Among the greatest talents, a positive attitude is essential for great successes.

A positive attitude can help individuals become successful by teaching them to focus on their goals, leading them to find creative solutions to problems, and helping them stay motivated. As a player for the Miami Heat, Wade refused to give in to adversity and continually sought to remain positive in order to lead the team to victory. Many successful people adopt a positive attitude to maximize their opportunities and reach their goals. With the right attitude, success can be achieved despite the obstacles",1
"Such behaviors can have a ripple effect in both peer groups and wider environments, inspiring a movement and creating meaningful change.. 
Recent studies have shed light on the significant influence of role models on individuals. Her courageous stand serves as an inspiring lesson of how one individual can make a difference, no matter the odds. 

One noteworthy example of a positive role model was Rosa Parks, the civil rights activist whose decision to remain seated on a segregated bus back in 1955 sparked a national movement that drew the attention of the whole world. In particular, teenagers are likely to take cues from those admired figures, which can affect their behavior and the environment around them. Famous and influential public figures have always existed, and with the rise of social media, their impact has become even more tangible. 

By setting a positive example, leaders and role models can encourage people to also act with integrity, respect, inclusion and kindness",1
"Having to use phones in your own free time is not a bad idea, but need to remember to turned off their phones in class.

From: STUDENT_NAME

2/28/11. Principal,

I think the best and awesome policy is policy number 1 , because the students need their cell phones to call their family members to pick them up. Dear. I see a lot of students use there phones in class, but maybe if you give them other free times to use it they may not use it during class periods",0
"Even in my life or my phat way so many dificult, but I velieved in my faiht there is nothing impossible.

But i have to work hard to get them ,because nothing come easy ,everything have price first then came be true, But I can't lose nothing to try ,try and try becouse wiil be successful In the future.

Even if I see now only in my dream and, dream in my future it's already mastered.

The people never grow because they fear to try, to do some bighest or highest is the most enemig byself .I can't grow more toll,but I tread believed in my self and first God, will be grow me in wisdom that is my best part I can't do by mayself,the first thing to is to have good health, and my family to.

So I agree to do something beyon what I already Mastered.. In my opinion.

I agree with Emerson to be right when he wrote everyone can do eny things, but not every one wants to work hard to do.

Example.

In my personan I think to have my own helicopter in the future.

In this word evething goods is posible something more than more beyonnd whtaever my effort my or how many i give to soporting them",0
"However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it. Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm.

I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes it's way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done.

I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn't know what kind of video game to make i didn't have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn't know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily.

some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try.

"Early grads need to stay focused and be willing to take more courses in any given semester to compensate for the lack of time. They may also need to be flexible in their approach to the different classes they take, and take online or other external classes to fully fill out the requirements.

The advantages of graduating early are manifold. Furthermore, since many college credits can be earned at the high school level, early grads may be able to take on full-time college courses during their first year of college. The payoff of being able to enter college or the job market more quickly is likely to outweigh the effort required to achieve this goal, leading to a more successful future.. By putting in the effort to bypass traditional high school curriculums, students are able to enter college or the work force at an earlier age, thereby giving them a head start over those who are the same age but stuck in high school for the standard four years.

In terms of the effort required to achieve this goal, the most important is to be organized and dedicated. This means they are more likely to secure a well-paying job and also have the opportunity to advance more quickly in their career. Firstly, students are able to enter college or the job market one year early. This could potentially save them a significant amount of money since they would not have to spend the full four years of college tuition.

Thus, it is clear that graduating high school in three years and entering college or the work force one year early can be a beneficial decision for motivated and organized students. 
Graduating high school in three years and entering college or the work force one year early is an increasingly popular option amongst students",1
"In a high-pressure academic environment, staying in touch with family and friends can be a key factor in the success and wellbeing of a student. Additionally, with the addition of cloud storage, cell phones can be an efficient way for students to easily organize and store notes, assignments, and other documents.

Aside from educational uses, cell phones can provide an important source of connection and support. From calculator apps for complex equations to interactive dictionaries for foreign language studies, cell phones have a wide variety of useful functions for bolstering a student’s educational pursuits. Furthermore, with the growing prevalence of cyberbullying in schools, having access to a cell phone can provide a student with a sense of safety and security to alert adults and authorities in the face of potential danger.

Overall, allowing the use of cell phones in school is a move towards greater connection and academic support. Therefore, with the right safeguards, it is both feasible and beneficial to allow the use of cell phones in school. 
Cell phones have become ingrained in our lives, providing unparalleled opportunities for connection and resources. 

Cell phones can assist in a student’s learning, providing useful tools for classroom activities. With the necessary safety measures and policies in place, permitting the use of cell phones can be a crucial step to providing students with the best possible learning environment.",1
"For example, you are at a job interview, you dress very properly for this job interview. All those people in your group sees that enthusiasm, and they think "" Man! She must be a really nice peson, I wish I have that kind of positivity in my life.""

That gives the perfect first impression to getting the first place in this job. In summary, positive attitude will switch your life around in life's hardest moments.

In Conclusion, positive attitude is the key to happiness and success in life. A girl name Generic_Name was injured badly that she has to be in a hospital.

Issues can occur, when we are doing the classes online from problems of slow WI-FI and also problems or differences with family that may affect us in our concetration with the classes, that's why i don't agree of having classes online. We will not be benefice of taking classes online and the reasons can be for slow internet, get distracted and not having time.

There is a bounch of students that have problems with slow internet, some times the internet doesn't

load the wed pages and with slow internet we can not due our online classes.        . One time i was with my friend in his home and he was taking his class online like every day and then the internet when down and he did not finish his class online and the internet didn't work until the next day.

Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we wan to eat, our parents need help and they call us and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online.When i was in LOCATION_NAME i took some classes online, it was my first class and my uncle did not know what i was doing classes online and he call me more then 3 times and because i was using my headphones and i did not ear when he call me the 3 times he get mad, he disconnect the computer and the computer shot down, i did not finish the class beacuse of my auncle and the teacher tell me that i was so disrespectfull to her and she didn't wan to give me classes again.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students don't have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. it's a gtood idea for us the students, like that we could know what we want to study when we be graduated from the high school. I think that's the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but it's not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school.

Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early.

the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too.

in others words if you don't have a good grades you can't sign for that schools.

You needed be prepare every time, If you do, You can study in the best university and achieve your dreams.. we have a lot of time to think about it",0
"People should consider deciding their path in a young age for their own benefit and betterment. Finally, her hard work paid off and acheived what she wanted to be. . Choosing which path should be taken in an early age and preparing for it beforehand, will help a lot for the future. Should s/he choose what s/he wants to be now or should s/he choose what s/he wanted to be when s/he was young? However, it is obvious that choosing a career later in their life will only make them feel burdensome and their life will only be more intricating.

A more valid argument is that choosing a path to be taken at a young age will let you have a better life in the future. To support this idea, a child decided to be an engineer when s/he was young, but suddenly s/he changed his mind and decided to be a surgeon. For example, a girl started to prepare for the career she had chosen when she was young and started to work hard for that. Although some people might argue students should commit to a career later in their life, students should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them to decide for their future early, it makes them focus on a specific goal, and they won't feel more pressured to choose a career later in their life.

To begin critics say that choosing their occupation later in their life is more beneficial because they will be open to more new options later than in a young age. This evidence is valid because preparing for the career in a young will let your life go smoothly, will give more free time in the future, and won't feel pressurized.

Although people might say that students committing towards your career and choosing it at a young age will lead you to a better life because it makes them to focus on a certain goal of their life, will make them decide what they want for the future, and won't feel pressurized to choose their career. My sister decided to be a doctor at a young age and started to focus on that path. Now, she is a doctor",0
"This allows them to take classes and specialize in certain areas that can help them stand out on college applications or job applications later on. Doing this can give students more time for independent study and other activities that can help with their future academic and professional goals.

Another advantage of taking courses over the summer or in the evening is that it gives students time to focus on certain subjects that they are interested in. Doing this can provide the student with valuable real-world experience and knowledge that can be difficult to gain in a traditional classroom setting.

In conclusion, taking courses over the summer or in the evening can provide high school students with a wealth of benefits, from bridging gaps in their education to exploring educational opportunities outside the classroom. For students looking to graduate earlier, these courses are a great way to maximize their time and make the most of their high school experience.. 
Taking courses over the summer or in the evening offers numerous benefits for high school students looking to graduate early. It can also help them build their resume and further demonstrates their commitment to their education.

Lastly, by taking summer or evening courses, high school students can use their available time to explore other educational opportunities such as internships or research opportunities without consuming the bulk of their regular school day. One of the most attractive benefits is that it can bridge gaps in a student's education, helping them to accelerate their coursework and graduate earlier",1
"In addition, the lack of physical presence can also reduce the potential for cheating, by providing a secure environment where all students have equal access to resources. One of the key advantages of distance learning is that it frees students from the physical and social pressures that can be found in a classroom setting. With so many advantages, distance learning offers an ideal educational solution for students who are looking for an alternative to the traditional classroom environment.. Without the traditional classroom environment, students can avoid the peer pressure, judgment, and discouragement that can be experienced in an academic context. Furthermore, distance learning offers a scalable form of education that can be easily accessible to students regardless of geographic location, allowing students to continue their studies without worrying about their ability to attend a physical classroom. 
Distance learning can provide students with a valuable educational experience that can be tailored to their individual needs, offering a range of benefits that the traditional classroom setting cannot",1
"
First impressions are incredibly powerful and should not be taken lightly. 

To illustrate my point, consider the following scenario: I recently met someone who I felt an immediate dislike for. From a single look, we can assess a person’s personality, intelligence, and even their trustworthiness. Ultimately, it’s important to give people the benefit of the doubt and be willing to give them a chance.. This experience taught me that there’s more to a person than their first impression. But what happens if that judgment proves to be inaccurate - if the person we initially took an immediate dislike to turns out to be a valuable friend or mentor? What if we find out further down the line that their first impression has nothing to do with their character at all? I believe that first impressions can be changed with the right combination of charisma and personality.

Having charisma and personality are essential for creating a good first impression, as they can help people overcome any negative preconceptions they might have. Charisma is often seen as an innate quality, but it can also be developed over time, as people learn how to use gestures, expressions, and body language to influence the people around them. It also taught me that it’s important to be open-minded and willing to give people a chance regardless of first impressions.

In conclusion, first impressions can be changed. By combining charisma and personality in a positive way, people can work to create a better first impression and challenge negative preconceptions. Personality, on the other hand, is about presenting the best version of yourself in any given situation, and is something that can be worked on with practice. But after getting to know them better and seeing them in different environments, I realized that my first impression was wrong",1
"This means that it is possible to be resilient to failure and to continuously persist in the pursuit of our goals. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious. 

By never allowing ourselves to be discouraged by failure and instead projecting enthusiasm and optimism, we can find the strength and motivation to keep pressing forward on our path to success.. 
When it comes to achieving success in life, school, work and sports, there is an old adage that you can go from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. It can give us the hope and courage to continue on our journey, despite the hardships and setbacks that we may face. 

Enthusiasm is often overlooked as a vital ingredient to our success, but it can be a powerful motivator. If we can tap into this positivity and spread it to those around us, we can help to inspire and motivate them to do the same",1
"By gaining experience in the corporate setting, students are better prepared for their future careers. All of these advantages can be realized through partnerships between schools and companies, providing students with an invaluable opportunity to prepare for their future.. Furthermore, these partnerships can often lead to internships and job opportunities as students build relationships with professionals. 
Partnerships between schools and companies have many benefits for students. They gain a sense of professionalism and confidence in their abilities, as well as an understanding of the requirements needed to succeed in a given position. Not only are students exposed to different work environments and taught the necessary job skills, but they are able to acquire an understanding of what job requirements are expected. These partnerships are essential for providing students with a well-rounded view of the workplace",1
"
When it comes to achieving success, acting on tasks instead of waiting or doing nothing are two key elements that play an important role. This decision enabled him to become one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world. This is why it is essential to be willing to take action and not wait for opportunities to come our way. For instance, multiple entrepreneurs have emphasized the importance of hard work, taking risks, determination, and continuously striving to improve. By looking at the stories of two successful entrepreneurs as examples, it is possible to recognize that these two entrepreneurs also share similar traits. He founded multiple companies of his, ranging from Virgin Atlantic Airways to Virgin Galactic. He trusted his instincts and made the decision to leave the comfort of university and pursue his creative ideas with Apple. 

By researching the stories of successful entrepreneurs, it is possible to identify the common characteristics that each of them have in common. 

Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was a great example of someone who was determined and willing to take risks. 

From the stories of entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Richard Branson, it is possible to identify various traits that they both share such as a sense of determination, a willingness to take risks, and most importantly, having the courage to act on tasks instead of waiting or doing nothing. Therefore, it is important to realize that it is necessary to act on tasks instead of waiting or doing nothing in order to achieve success.. Similarly, Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, is also a perfect example of someone who was not afraid to take chances in order to turn his dreams into reality",1
"""Where is one place in the world you would like to visit?""

""We should to go to

Generic_City over the summer, and talk to new people!"" I excitedly told my friends 3 weeks before the school was gonna end. Finally we got to the museum and saw the famous art of the Monaliza. When my friends and I went out for a walk on the morning, we walked by the park. My friends were very happy when we got to the ground, so we decided to take pictures, they had a big smile on their face as we took the pictures, the place was beautiful, we walked all over the place, and took a bunch of picture with the Eiffel tower, and where it was located. When we were walking to go see the Eiffel tower, it didn't seem big, but when we got closer, it seemed huge, I was shocked because I never knew that it was very huge. Generic_Name was a very special person, he invite us with him and his friends to the restaurant. Visiting the Eiffel tower was a very exiting experience for me, and my friends, we got to see the view of the Eiffel Tower.

Second we can experience the life of the other people that live in Generic_City.

Meeting new people in the park is very exiting for me and my Friends. Then we experienced their food, and the Restaurant that Generic_Name and his friends like to go to. Finally we took pictures of the the beautiful surroundings of the Tower. As we were on the top of the Eiffel tower I could not believe that I could see the beautiful view of the lights of the city. When we were walking to the restaurants that they were taking us to, I could already smell the delicious smell of the food of the Restaurant. Generic_Name and his friends gave us a tour in the museam, and he told us that the most famous art there was the Monaliza, it was a beautiful art, but we couldn't take pictures of it because it the not permitted. But we got to see her beautiful smile, and I was inspired by the way, the artist colored the background of the picture. Then on the top of the Eiffel Tower, the city can be seen. My friends spotted a groups of friends that were walking in our direction, they introduced themselves and we did too, we told them that we were visiting here, and they were so nice, and we started chatting. There was a lot of things we learned about Generic_City with the help of Generic_Name and his friends.

The way other people talk, or the differences that we have among each other, and other places doesn't mean that you cant find good people, wherever you go, you just have to let your self enjoy an amazing experience in Generic_City.. My friends, Generic_Name,Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and I think that Generic_City is the best place that we can go visit, because it can be a very exiting experience, and we can go out to see the Eiffel Tower, and experience the life of other people.

First I would visit the Eiffel tower with my friends.

"For example, a group of students working on a school project can divide the work into manageable amounts, with each member of the group having their own task and accountability for its completion. Additionally, establishing clear expectations, goals, and deadlines for the project, and assigning clear roles to each group member, can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that all tasks are completed on time. 

In conclusion, working in groups can offer both academic and social benefits, but challenges can arise if adequate measures are not taken to ensure everyone is working together efficiently and respectfully. These skills can prove to be invaluable both in and out of the classroom, as they can improve interactions, communication, and teamwork abilities in other aspects of life.

Though working in groups can offer these benefits, it can also pose potential challenges. 
Group collaboration can offer a number of benefits both academically and socially. Students can form relationships with their peers and learn how to work effectively as a team. In terms of academics, working in groups promotes the sharing of ideas and resources, which can improve the quality of the work being done and reduce the overall burden of tasks. By doing this, the overall project can be completed much more efficiently than if each student was working on their own.

Socially, working in groups can allow for the development of relationships and networking opportunities. To overcome this, group members should be mindful of giving each other space and voice, and be open to productive feedback and compromise. By fostering communication and understanding within the group, and by establishing expectations and roles, the members of a group can work together effectively to complete a project with the best possible results.. Not every group member is capable of putting in an equal amount of effort, and a lack of respect for one another’s contributions can lead to inefficiencies or delays in completing the projects",1
"

On the other hand, failure can be devastating and cause people to give up. Without failure, we cannot appreciate the small victories and measures of progress that occur on the path to success. Even if failure leads you down a different path, it can still result in achieving your goals. 
Failure plays a crucial role in the pursuit of success. Instead of viewing failure as a roadblock, we should see it as a valuable learning opportunity. 

Ultimately, embracing our failures and learning from them is essential in the pursuit of success. It can be discouraging and make the goal of success seem like an impossible task. But, it is important to remember that failure should not be all-encompassing and it should not define who you are. Learning from our past experiences and taking a constructive approach to failure will make us better prepared and more successful on our journeys.. It is only a moment in time and a negative experience can eventually lead to positive results. By taking risks and failing, we can develop a better understanding of what works and what does not. Although failure can be daunting and a source of frustration, it can also lead to meaningful connections, newfound confidence, and valuable lessons. Through analyzing our successes and failures, we can gain insights into the underlying skills necessary for achieving success. We must understand that failure is a necessary part of growth and success",1
"But It's alright because not everyone would have the time or just would'nt want to do It. It also taught me how to use power tools and utilitys and for me I think it's better to know how to do different things like how to change the oil from your car or how to fix something that went wrong In your car like If something went wrong with your engine or If some hoses came loose. I believe on what Mr. In my experience In working In construction I learned how to measure wood, cut wood, and Install wood frames and all of that taught me how to be a more efficient person at my job. I believe If a person just want to know one thing and be great at It that's their right and that is acceptable, but they will be only focusing on one thing. So I think it great If someone has already mastered something that they really like doing, but I believe it better to know many different things like construction or car mechanic or how to connect electricity wires because I truly believe that knowing many different things can give you more knowledge for the future.. Emerson said about being a master at something but not growing",0
"However, committing to a career too early can be detrimental to personal growth. Young people tend to be particularly energetic and motivated and so can focus on their career ambitions early on. Therefore, committing to a career at a young age can be a substantial decision and it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons.. Furthermore, you may change your mind as you get older and find it harder to adjust to a different career. 
Committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and drawbacks. On the positive side, an early commitment can help to focus your education and give you an impetus to work hard towards your chosen goal. You may miss out on trying new activities and exploring different paths",1
"I believe that high schools should never let students choose specific courses because, some of students don't even have in mind what they're trying to do after high school, another reason is that they're way too young to choose something that is going to affect your whole life, my last reason is that students may change their mind and choose another course and the school is not going to let them choose another course.

High school students change their mind all the time we may want to be a doctor today and tomorrow we want to be a barber or wanna go to the army, for example my best friend go to a school like that you have to choose some specific courses so when you get graduate you don't be confused about what you going do in college and he told me that he's trying go to a different school because that school doesn't let him change his courses because he was trying be a firefighter but now he change his mind and want to a doctor.

We high school students are way to young to choose some specific courses for our careers I believe they should make a conference and discuss all that with our parents.

My final reason is because students not really sure about what are we trying do in my opinion they should let us do that on the student's senior year because, on their senior year students have a clear mind set of what they going to do after students graduate, like my other friend that go to Generic_School now he's a senior and he's going to be doctor so the school just want him to take the nurse and biology class.

In conclusion, I believe that school should never let students choose their classes or courses, even though it would be nice if you want to be a doctor for example the school should force you to take doctor's relate classes so you can get use to do things that doctors does.. According to the Generic_School, that believe that 70% high school students change their mind about what career they want to do after high school",0
"According to Emerson, fitting in is a detrimental force which seeks to suppress individuality, and he argues that we should instead strive to stand out and honor our individual selves. However, there is an underlying importance to individuality which cannot be overstated, especially in modern society. While this philosophy certainly provides an admirable model for personal development, it is important to remember that individual expression in modern society is not as easily facilitated as it may have been in Emerson’s era. It is paramount to remember that while conformity is often rewarded in the short-term, being one’s authentic self can often lead to longer-term success. 
In a world increasingly driven by conformity, it can be difficult to stay true to oneself. Thus, despite the temptation to conform, it is important to consider the positive influence individual expression can have on one’s life and career.. We are constantly bombarded by societal pressures to fit in, and many of us feel obligated to obey the norms set by powerful mainstream entities. With the advent of new forms of media and constant bombardment of constructed ideals, it can often be more difficult for an individual to break through the noise and gain recognition for their talents.

Ultimately, it is important to remember that there is still value in individuality, regardless of the obstacles that may stand in the way. Despite the temptation to follow the crowd, standing out and embracing one’s unique identity can often lead to greater success.

It is necessary to consider Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson’s perspective on being an individual when discussing this issue",1
"Furthermore, transportation from and to school must be considered for students who are unable to drive. Finally, the traditional requirements, such as grades and classes, needed to enter schools with a successful track record should be examined. Additionally, high schools offering courses or qualifications related to these professions should be identified and evaluated. Before selecting a school, it is important to do research on the different types of careers related to aviation and their specific requirements. By considering all of these factors, students can make an informed decision about their chosen career path.. 

Flight school can open up a world of exciting options for students interested in pursuing a career as a pilot",1
"Weakness person are those who give up in the first try, they are incapable to fight for what they want in life, and don't let no one change your personality, if they really love you,they would love you like the way you are. If you pray to God and tell him what is going on in your life, he will helps you to solve it, like he solve David's battle. Desagree,To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment

To be yourself in this world is kind of difficult, but if you try really hard you will success with honor,respect,humble and make you strong. You will found a lot of obstacle in life and all you have to do is play like you are on the soccer field.

You have to be strong and prepare for what's coming in life and do not worry if others tell you that you are useless, just show it to them that you can do it. Not trying after you lose make people weakness, fearful and incapable.

If you want to success in life and future, just help others when they need it, and be humble with those people who do not have anything in life and they have to sleep in the street. Remember that your happiness are inside, all you have to do is look for it and find something that you can prove yourself , that you made it without help and make yourself feel proud and do not let people take advantage of your insecurity because you are great, you are strong and that is all you have to do, focused on your success.. Do not let people change the way you are, because some people just come and goes through and we have to enjoy what we got while we have it and do all the things that we haven't, and thanks God because we are here.

Conclusion,

Live the life you love and love the life you live, just do what makes you happy. Be yourself every where you go, you do not have to change your personality because other people do not likes you. I hate it when people said like what happen if I do not looks pretty, you are pretty inside and outside, do not make yourself miserable.

The struggles will make you strong and get all you want in life, like David and Goliath, ""the little boy who fight with the giant warrior and he won, when he throw the rock into his eyes"", no matter how big is the problem and how small you are, you have to fight with your fear. All I can say is be yourself, if you want to dye your hair blue and you are afraid what people opinions are, just do it, do not start walk around to find your happiness because your happiness are inside. Not trying after you lose make you weakness person. My mom always told me,""do not give up till you are in the top"",after all the struggles you will be a better person.

Nobody can change yourself, you are the only one who can dicide what you really want to be in life. You have to prove yourself that you can do it, no matter how many time you fell down, just stand up clean yourself and continue. Sometimes people just left and give up. Nobody is more than others, God make us equal. You make your own rules, but you have to respect others, I will give you a counsel, If people treat you worthless do not treat them like the way they treats you,be original and treat them like royalty, after that, they will see that who lose gold was them,not you. Do not let no one hurt you because we are in a world where no one wants to see any body get victory",0

Without hope, we can become disillusioned and neglect the things that matter. However, it is important to keep believing in yourself and to have hope no matter what. We may fall into a negative state of mind, become apathetic, and lose touch with reality. Similarly, if we put in the effort to work towards our goals, it can help to cultivate optimism and resilience. Having hope in life means that we can look to the future despite any challenges we may face. We can learn valuable lessons from life that can be applicable to our own lives, and by having hope, we give ourselves the opportunity to have a more rewarding and fulfilling life.. It means having faith that things will get better, and that we can learn from our mistakes.

The lessons we learn from life can often be applied to our own lives. For example, if we learn to value the little things in life, then we will be more content and grateful for what we have, not always chasing after material goods or things that don't necessarily bring us happiness. 

In conclusion, it is essential to keep believing in oneself and to never lose hope in life. We view life as meaningless or hopeless. Doing so can help us stay positive and find meaning even in the most difficult of times. Too much negativity can make it hard to build relationships, and it can start to hinder us from achieving our goals and making progress.

"After many failed attempts, my aunt was finally able to visit her family in China. Success truly does come with perseverance.. 
My aunt's failed attempts to travel may have been discouraging, but looking back, I can see that these failures led to a great success. After failing the test three times, I eventually passed and was accepted into college. Churchill's statement ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" is true in both of these cases. Though failure can be discouraging, it can lead to even greater successes if you stay enthusiastic and don't give up. The same could be said of my experience with a failed English test in high school",1

Changes to the policy that requires students to have an A or B grade to participate in sports would have a variety of implications. The most obvious implication would be that students with lower grades would be allowed to participate in sports, which could ultimately result in an increase in student participation. On the other hand, allowing lower-performing students to participate could make them less inclined to put in the extra effort necessary to get an A or B grade, or to attend classes, as they may come to rely on sports as their primary source of motivation. Further, this could create an atmosphere in which the more successful students, who may have chosen to participate in sports as a reward for their hard work, would become discouraged and potentially less inclined to maintain their high grades. Consequently, all aspects of student effort, grades, and behavior should be carefully considered before instituting changes to this policy.. On the positive side, allowing lower-performing students to participate in sports could inspire them to strive for better grades in order to stay in the sport. However, this could have both positive and negative side effects",1
"On the other hand, it can be hard to remain focused and stay on task without the structure and support of an after school program. However, after school activities can also have disadvantages. 

Doing homework at home has its own advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, a student is able to work independently and in a familiar environment, where they may feel more comfortable and secure. Additionally, students in after school activities often benefit from close relationships with mentors and coaches and have the potential to be part of a team. Additionally, the lack of peer interactions and motivation in an unstructured setting can lead to a student becoming easily distracted.. 
After school activities offer advantages such as providing an engaging environment with a sense of camaraderie, fostering the development of important social skills, and enhancing physical health. For instance, students may be exposed to activities that are not consistent with school values and beliefs, and the amount of time devoted to such activities may interfere with the student’s ability to complete their homework in a timely manner",1

"She is learn English for three years, now she can talk a little bit English to other. That will be you best time time, you grow up again. Responsibility make you get a word called grow up. When you have a wedding with a girl. They can grow up from society. In a science experiment if you get a small mistake, the all experiment will be destruction by that little mistake. In China we don't have the thing that Ralph Waldo Emerson. I am disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote.

People can look for new things and learn the things to grow up. And there are three reasons I disagree about what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote looking for new things and learn it make people grow, some small vital can make people grow up, and other vital matter can make people grow up. In this example I learn the little things happen let they know the mall will become the big thing than it will bother you life.

People can have many things in their life can make they grow up. Then if you have a baby, you will get what is the really mean about responsibility. The new things are not for human control. In my opinion people are different, so not everyone can grow up from beyond the things his already mastered. Nobody can say she is not grow up, she learn a new Lagrange she never know before. In my mom story I know not the things you have already mastered in past make you grow up, the new things can make you grow up, too.

People can have many small things that they don't care make they grow up. They can control it is happened or not. Many things make people grow up the work, wife, kids, and other things make people really grow up.

Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" It may work for Ralph Waldo Emerson or other people, but I disagree what he say. When you go to the work, you can feel effort is not the only choice, it is many way can get you go to the high lever. People who learn science, if they make that small mistake they will get their master abusive, nobody knows if the experiment will make people change. When you go to the society, you will find it is so different between school and society. I know Ralph Waldo Emerson think he is grow up because he beyond he has already mastered. This is a example of my mom. In China it has so many reason make you grow up.. People are different, they have many different way to make they grow up, not the only way like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. People can study new things to make their knowledge be more.

If they beyond the game that they already have play the best, they are not grow up. Students learn new things make their knowledge be more, they can grow up in this way.

"And the person who have a good attitude they have more prosperity to arrive in to be successful and do they goals cross all obstacle.

In some time in this life occasion the person need to have a good attitude when are do somenthing because the life wait with to much surprise and when the person who demostrate have the best implement to win and the best form to win,what want is have a positive attitude and to much dedication.

For triunfal and to have a good to be succesful the people they need to havea possitive attitude when they are doing something because when the people do the righ things and with pleasure always they are winer and the good look that coming in they future with recompense valuable for that person.. When some person they have a positive attitude they are more blessing in the life and more apportunity to triumph in this life.

The person who have a positive attitude they have enithing, because in some job or company they see and check to the another people and they see who have a good attitude for the work and some job need to the dismiss the person who have the negative attitude.

To have a positive attitude you can make to much friend because some person like the people who are positive because when they need support or help you are there whith you good attitude and they can do a very good trusted.

"People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life.

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things.

You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true.

It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt.

People wont be able to brake you down that easily.

So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life.

When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it.

Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking ""oh theres no way im going to make it"".

Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action.

Sometimes your words reflect your actions.

This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life.

Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"".

Lets talk about why i mention ""faith"".

Having faith makes you believe in yourself'

When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action.

But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible.

This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other.

So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a possitive attitude.

Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too.

If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad.

The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours.

For example, if i say to myself ""Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try"".

Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try.

So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",0
"Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. I think online school is good for students. If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day. If schools offers students distance learning as an option, that student should take the offer. They can take online school, so they don't fail a grade, or miss any important assignment.. My second reason is that its less cheaper. Students also receive free food from their home. That's my opinion if a school ever offer me online school. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school",0
"Many students will focuse in their future. Students can't spend to much time at collage or Univercity because if they are preparede making progres at high school about their career.

Some careers take long time to have improve your skills ant practice more study more but if they do that at high school it's not going take to much time in the future.

Also if a student have the career that he wants it's going help him to be prepare more when he go to a collage.

Third, If students have specific career, student can be prepared at high school what they really want to be or to study in the future. they can know how long they took at high school and graduate. There are many students that don't want to stay at school long time because some students want just work.

Second, should students commit to a career because they can focuse of school if they identify a career. The lasthing they can focuse of school if they can identify a career and they can study more fast to take out at high school.

"Working towards a goal is beneficial and an accomplishment.

Inactivity doesn't serve a purpose at all but maybe in small aspects it does. Trying is always the best option because at least you attempted to do something. Not doing anything and waiting for something to happen is not realistic. By moving forward we get to discover new things and see a change. Working hard to get something feels so much more cherish able. Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" By saying this I believe he meant people should never be lazy but to always be working towards something. By always doing something we are always moving forward no matter what it is. Working towards a goal helps us to become more aware and understanding of the world around us. Things can get done if we are always doing.                                                                             . By working towards getting better grades the outcome is getting into a good collage. Not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too.

An example of being active and it helping/benefiting someone is if a person gets good grades so they can get into a better collage. By not being active accomplishments aren't being met rather someone else doing it.

Actively working and trying to accomplish something is most ideal. Always try your best even if you feel like you can't. Being able to out figure a way to accomplish something can help benefit others.

I believe we always accomplish more if we are always doing something whether it be small things or big things, we always have to keep moving forward. It all depends on the type of situation. For example if someone is having a bad day you can't change their mood they have to do it themselves so in this situation you can't do much for them. Never attempting to do something is bad",0
"For those with slow internet, downloading large files or accessing streaming content can be difficult or even impossible. Additionally, students can proactively seek out faster, more reliable internet connections, and make sure they are equipped with the right hardware and software to support online activities. Lastly, many students have limited time to devote to online learning, either due to school or work obligations, or due a chaotic lifestyle. 

There are potential solutions to these challenges, such as setting up a dedicated workspace that reduces distractions, taking brief breaks throughout the day to refocus, and scheduling regular study periods. 

Online learning can present unique challenges for students, as slow internet, distractions, and limited time can significantly impede their ability to make the most of their educational experience. In addition, students may struggle to stay focused and motivated if they are being pulled away from their studies by family, friends, and other distractions. It is also important to break down large projects or tasks into smaller chunks, so that progress can be made in a timely manner. By accessing faster, more reliable internet, becoming organized in their approach to studying, and taking regular breaks to stay refreshed, students can overcome the unique obstacles that online learning presents.. 

If implemented effectively, these solutions can be highly effective in helping students to make the most of their online learning experience",1
"Once you get to know them and see who they really are you will see the complete opposite and it could be too late to turn back.

In conclusion whether you try to be your self and accomplish your goal there will always be people who will hate you and bring you down with them. They will manipulate you at first thinking they are good people and want to see you accomplish being thing in life. when they see you succeeding and doing better than they are, they will talk about you because they arent where you are and they will make you try to feel down and unsuccessful.

When trying to do good things in life people will down really low to the point where you give up, and just try to fit in and do bad thing that could lead you down a wrong path, to where you can end up in prison or dead you can end up in the wrong crowd, when you thought they were good people. No matter how much you try you will end up falling because of being yourself and choosing the wrong crowd.. Do you think being in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is a good thing? I think it can be bad.

When you are trying to accomplish things and make friends, it can get you hated. First off when you open up to people and be honest with them, they aren't going to like it and turn on you and hate you",0
"                    . fake news post on Twitter spreading rumors for an example

Michelle Obama is running for president in 2020.

The limitation, First, it percent the young generation basis social skills. It allows bulling on the internet. In my opinion we should turn off our phones for at lest 1 to 2 day and going out to eat with our friends with out our phones. Secondly it allows bulling on the internet. In a way people are trapped in their own world it stops people from learning about them self and others.

Second, someone can post a video to make a person feel bad about them self attempt suicide. For example, the student walks into the class room they are in their phones 24/7 of the day. Lastly it also allows trolling on the internet. The limitation of human contacted due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people. Or a person can post a picture where their drunk and they post it on Facebook and tag them on it and on Instagram. It also allows trolling on the internet.

First, Technology interferes with student social skills. I saw a video on YouTube.

A girl from Australia is getting bullied online, and at school also on the intent and her family had to move at lest 3 time because of this issue.

Lastly charting rooms where you can meet serial killers. In school teachers should wait for students out side the door with a box so they can't use their phones during class. It prevents the young generation of today basis social skills. So on bulling last longer and that goes beyond the internet so in conclusion should be more stricter, technology limits people talking about their issues. In the class room the students are on the computers playing video games instead of interacting with one another",0
"  . Second they have to be brave to talk about to the doctor, for example if you kill somebody and you don't know what to do and you have bad attitude than you have to go to talk with somebody you trust, you have to be brave.

But as you can see there is many ways to influence other and had talk to them they will have good education. They will be doing the same to other person.

Other Person when they talk about they own behavior they get mad because they know what they are doing something bad they get nervous. In this quote that Albert Schweitzer wrote said ""Example is not the main thing influencing others; it is the only thing."" There are many different ways to influence other. For example if you scream everyday to them they will not respect you and then will not care anymore. for example talk to them about your experience.

Although some say that should not influence other people about own behavior because people will get mad, actually some say there should be own behavior is the way to influence others because you can have more friend and be a good person.

In my opinion, the best way to influence other is talk softly and calm because they can understand more",0
"By allowing ourselves to come to terms with each other and take into consideration the thoughts and ideas of others, we can become more informed, and better understand one another. Without it, it would be pointless to even try to share ideas, because there would be no agreement on what the truth actually is. Agreement plays a vital role in human interaction, as it allows us to come to terms with one another and move forward with our lives.. When we seek to defend our own opinions or argue against someone else's, it can become a barrier to finding common ground and understanding one another.

In fact, it can be argued that without agreement, it would be impossible to develop any sort of understanding. Ralph Waldo Emerson put it this way: ""In the state of communication, the power which resides in one mind, becomes the property of another."" In other words, it is through the effect of agreement that the thoughts and ideas of one person can be understood and adopted by another.

This can be especially true when sharing different opinions and ideas. 
Agreement plays an essential role in connecting people's different experiences and allowing them to learn from one another. 

It is through agreement that we find understanding and insight into different perspectives and ideas; it allows us to grow and gain knowledge, which can lead to great things. On the other hand, agreement helps us to better comprehend each other's views and allows us to make more informed decisions",1
"Ultimately, the best approach may be to choose a field that student are passionate about and remain openminded to changes in the long-term in case circumstances change.. In addition, students may also feel a lot of pressure as they are stuck with a single decision they made in their youth, without the benefit of hindsight or the wisdom that comes with age.

Overall, there can be advantages and disadvantages to committing to a career at a young age, depending on the individual. Being too focused on a particular path can lead to tunnel vision, resulting in students missing out on other opportunities that may have been beneficial to them. The thought of committing to one job for an extended amount of time can be scary to some, while others welcome the decision. To determine if committing to a career early on is beneficial for students, we must consider both the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.

One of the main advantages of committing to a career at a young age is the sense of security it brings. By knowing what job they will be working towards, students have the opportunity to gain a greater focus on studies and skills related to their chosen field. It is important for students to carefully weigh the pros and cons before making any major decisions and to ensure that the choice still fits their changing interests and values as they grow and mature. This can help build a strong foundation for a successful start in their chosen career and may ultimately prevent them from facing any major career changes in the future. 

On the other hand, commitment to a specific career at a young age can also have some downsides. 
Deciding on a career path at a young age can be an intimidating prospect for many students",1
"

I have realized that there are moments in my life where I have leaned towards becoming whom others believe I should be, and then moments of proud self-actualization where I realized my own potential and determination to be who I want to be. 
Throughout my life, I've worked to find my own personal identity. 

To continue on my journey of self-reflection and autonomy, I am creating a plan to focus on self-growth and finding what makes me happiest and using that as the foundation for making my own choices. It allows one to better understand themselves and their goals in life, while ensuring that they create goals only for themselves, not for external approval. From my experiences in discovering my own identity, I understand now that there can be immense value in finding autonomy and becoming an individual. Being an individual reminds me of the power I have to make my own decisions and I believe that this will help me become a better person than I was previously.. This plan includes setting achievable goals that place the value of my own opinion and well-being first. I've learned from Ralph Waldo Emerson's inspiring words that ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" and I have been reflecting on my own life journey to understand my identity",1
"By understanding this concept, and knowing how to effectively channel competitive spirit, I am able to apply it to my day-to-day life. 
Growing up with an older brother, I gained a perspective on competition that motivates me to this day. To be competitive, I needed release my passion and put my all into achieving my goals. It is important for those who are competitive to ensure that they remain humble and respectful, as well as understand the importance of cooperation. Having a competitive attitude can propel an individual to success in any field, and it can also help foster collaboration. Having to compete with him for everything, from the latest video games to admissions to the best universities, I learned that in order to succeed I had to be competitive. I learned to set realistic goals, challenge myself, and stay focused on the task at hand. I also learned the importance of collaboration, as sometimes even an individual can only go so far without the help of others.

The importance of being competitive cannot be overstated. Being competitive is essential in order to reach personal and professional goals, and I hope that others will be able to learn from my experiences.. It helped me to understand the importance of setting goals and taking risks in order to achieve them, and my desire to become a pro basketball player is a prime example of this.

My experience of competing against my brother not only fostered my competitive spirit, but also taught me how to channel it effectively. I found that I was able to stay motivated and make the best use of the resources available",1

"Japan, the one place in the world I would like to visit.

Whenever people mentioned this country, I believe that what they're thinking to are the scenes and foods over there. Many little pinky leafs formed numerous soft and fluffy flowers. I can't describe it, but I know there is a wonderful place in Japan where can eat a lot of things, and also can buy anything you want. And they all have their own special places. So, I know there is a country described like that. However, the such beautiful scenes in Japan is also the one thing that attracted me. At this time, the laughing sounds is even louder than morning.

Japan, a such wonderful place, a place that I would like to visit.. The blossom tree is the most beautiful image I have been wanted to see from Japan. Only this image is enough to grab all people's attention from the country. I think that's a such enjoyable thing.

The Japanese foods are also famous. Sometimes just bring your food outside and find a blossom tree, then sit under it, looking at the image while eating. The nicest scene is not just that, but also when the night is coming. During some special holidays, a bunch of people will came here and participate some small activities which only have at night. Everytime, you already can hear the laughing sounds even you're not step in. How warm is it. And now, just imagine that when all leafs are falling off from the tree, that scene just looks like many butterflies are dancing in the sky. The Japanese market, the one place I want to go at most in my mind. With this happy atmosphere, and walk slowly to find out the things you want to buy.

"Studies have shown that when individuals prioritize their tasks and goals, the end result is usually the successful completion of those goals. Additionally, it’s possible that one’s workload and commitments can become overwhelming, leading to burnout and a feeling of apathy towards one’s projects.

When considering the benefits and drawbacks of staying busy, it’s important to recognize that it’s possible to find the right balance.  Learning when to take a step back and take a break is key to remaining healthy and productive.. Busyness can often lead to fatigue, stress, and even physical exhaustion. 
Staying busy is often regarded as a key ingredient in achieving success. 

However, staying busy can also come with certain dangers. For those seeking success, actively pursuing goals can be an important part of that journey, but it’s important to remember to take time to rest and recharge. 

The advantages of staying busy can be seen in the positive results that are often attained when individuals dedicate their resources and energy towards achieving a specific goal. But what does that really mean? Simply put, it means actively pursuing goals, and the advantages and disadvantages that come with it. For many, setting and achieving goals is a form of self-improvement that provides a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment",1

By extending the school hours the student might not be mad to stay all day at school so some student will not show up at school. It well effect everyone at the school because there are some student that dont like school very much. So by extend the hours they will not show up to school and that will effect the school and them.

I dont think it well be a very good because there might have some student that have work after school. Because there is go to be more work to do at the end.

Some teacher are going to have some thing to do and work at thing at there homes so by extending the hours the teacher that have think to do they will not be abole to do it and that will make them mad and then they will quit sand that would not be a good idea for the school and the teacher and the student.

So that is why we shouldn do it because it will effect a lot of people and then it will make al lot of people not very happy so if we just keep it the way its soapstone it will be all OK cause then the student will be happy and the teachers will be happy so keeping it the way we have it will help a lot of people.. I think that by extending the school hours is not a very good idea. Or they might have to go and pick up there little brother or sister. Because the student will fail and that wont help them at all.

If you extend the school hour then there is going to be more homework to do and held at the end. Because they will not want to show up at school because they dont want to and that will effect everyone that u know. And by extending the hours it will not let them do it because they have to be in school and some student will lose there job because they had to stay at school all day.

"It is difficult to overstate the importance of these jobs in providing people with a living wage, stability, and a sense of purpose. Additionally, job seekers can use online tools such as LinkedIn and Indeed to create professional profiles and network with potential employers.

At the same time, technology has made certain types of jobs obsolete. This means investing in training and education as well as taking measures to ensure that jobs are safe and equitable. In this way, we can ensure that individuals have access to the jobs they need to support themselves and their families.. In order to maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its drawbacks, people must be mindful of the need for job security. While this can lead to increased efficiency and a better-functioning economy, it has also caused a great deal of anxiety and insecurity.

In the end, it is clear that although technology can make it easier to find and perform jobs, it also has the potential to displace workers. However, technology continues to revolutionize society, impacting our ability to gain and adequately perform these jobs.

On the plus side, technology has made it much easier for individuals to access job information and market themselves to employers. 
As the world continues to develop and evolve, the need for reliable and steady jobs is becoming increasingly apparent.

The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. In conclusion, the implications of adding extra time to the school day should be carefully considered before any additional hours are added..

Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours.

""" In this world you decide who do want to be either you get along with it or someone teach you"" although some people think that our character formed by influences beyond our control nevertheless we choose our character traits people on your environment and also people who you talk to i believe that the one that influence me is that we choose our own characters

First People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be and you choose your traits so i think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me he was more kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didnt care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can changes their traits depends on the environment that they are growing.

second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends coasins brotheres we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name recived a call from his parents saying Generic_Name its time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Tes mom i will go home right Away after he finish his call he talked to us saying Dude i need to leabe but like right now!! screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.

to conclude we choose our character traits because we talk and and people around we choos ehow we act aroubd people people who we talk to are the ones that affect us more because thats the one that we do on daily bases the other one people on your enviroment is the way that u want to be looked by different type of people around your self.",0

It's really important to follow those lessons because when your interviewing for a job or something like that you are gonna use those rules and life skills and show that your responsible and care about your future. When your older people are gonna realize how respectful you are and mature you are. That my family always taught me and others as well bacause they know others like it when you give them respect.

"As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesn't know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. People should not make their own decision. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. People can learn without making mistakes. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble.           . As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better",0
"First, while preparing for the SATs, I studied hard for over four months but still achieved only mediocre scores. 

Winston Churchill’s quote “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts” has had an impact on my views on failure – it has made me realize that failure is just a stepping stone to success, and that it should not be feared, but embraced. Secondly, my attempt to learn guitar was hampered by my lack of talent, and I kept failing every time I tried. 
When I think of failing but still achieving success, two personal experiences come to mind. Even though I had tried to convince him that perseverance was the only way forward, he seemed to have given up. They face failure, evaluate their mistakes and keep on striving for greater heights with a positive attitude and unceasing determination. People with this drive to never give up no matter how bleak the situation may be truly understand that failure is not an end, but a path to a greater success.. But, I kept at it and eventually taught myself well enough to make basic melodies and chords. Seeing him give up so easily made me realize how important it is to be willing to take risks and keep failing until we eventually find success.

I believe the most successful people are the ones who maintain enthusiasm for success even after failure. Yet rather than giving up, I studied more compromises and eventually scored high enough to gain admission into the college I wanted to attend. Rather than being a deterrent to success, failure should be embraced as an opportunity to learn and grow.

I also recall one instance when a friend of mine quit soon after attempting something difficult",1
"In order to stay true to ourselves, we must evaluate the decisions we make in regards to conforming to the behavior of those around us and make sure that our individual values are not compromised in the process.. We risk subscrib- ing to some potentially harmful ideas which can, in the long run, prove extremely detrimental for us.

In conclusion, living in a world where people try to force others to conform often leads to very negative outcomes. 
Living in a world where people try to force others to conform can be incredibly detrimental to our well-being, both mentally and physically. By being pressured into conforming, we risk sacrificing our individual sense of identity and originality for the sake of fitting in among everyone else. 

Finally, there is an element of danger in trying to fit into a group if it involves participating in activities that deviate from our personal moral and ethical standards. By refusing to highlight our individual preferences, beliefs and even our quirks, we may end up leaving ourselves isolated and disconnected from other people. 

We may also become lost in a sea of sameness, where it seems as though everyone experiences the same scenarios, and the same trials and tribulations. We may try to emulate the behaviors and looks that those around us have adopted, and in doing so, we may be blind to our own carefully crafted uniqueness. It is important to remember that by embracing our distinctive characteristics, we are able to form individual opinions and interpretations of the world, and this can lead to better understanding of ourselves, our peers and the world as a whole",1
"Well,A good attitude is always the key in our lifes be good with others people,I'm agree with the statement the good attitude represent, Where we we're born, How our parents gave us education where i was born they always taugh me how treat people do the right thing, If we always do good things around us, Good things will come around us.

I'm going to tell a history about me, my parents alway before i go to shool they always told me be respecful with the olders people if you see people when your walking say hi,Good morning no just old people, kids like you need respect if you respect they will treat you with respect, Then i was walking in the street i alway remember, What mom told me one month after i forgot what mom told me one month before,I went to shool there was a party at school the teacher who was my science teacher he was so rude with me what i did was so rude too, but i remember just in the moment what my mom told me what i did when i remember what mom told me, i just turn around and walk away,I said ,Wooow his parents didn't taugh him how to treat people with respect the night was so fun the party over around 4:00 am in the morning, When i get home my mom was so worry about me bacause i didn't tell her, The days pass and you don't know the time is a clock never stop if you see around you your parents are getting older in that time you want the days pass too fast, I'm 18 now i see what my parents told me, how bautiful is see kids,boys, old people together is bautiful when you see there's respect each other respect is the key for many ways to see people they are like you to get respect others and wetherever you go everyone will treat you with respect if you respect them the positive attitude always bring you good things,your future is in your hands don't waste your time is running respect others people the positive attitude will bring you a good job and new opportunities.",0
"We must be willing to solve puzzles, explore past boundaries, and take risks in order to grow and become the best versions of ourselves.. As an amateur soccer player, I never took my skills to the professional level, but if I chose to, I would have had to try something far beyond what I had already mastered. By not shying away from more difficult activities and taking on challenges, he has managed to peak as a four-time MVP and become one of the best players in the game’s history. Similarly, Kobe Bryant is also renowned for constantly pushing himself to the limit to become a better player; as a result, he achieved greatness and the opportunity to be gifted with five NBA championship rings. In her own words, “You will never grow unless you are willing to try something new. 

Likewise, celebrities outside the sports world have also credited their success to embracing challenge. For example, LeBron James has continuously experimented and evolved his game since the day he joined the NBA. Sometimes that means taking risks, and sometimes it means outgrowing your comfort zone.”

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote holds true in our lives. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote, “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,” rings true in my own life and through studying the experiences of others. Taylor Swift is a well-known example; she has moved past her country music roots and released multiple chart-topping pop albums, pushing her career to new heights. By pushing myself to my limits and rise to the challenge, I would have found a way to develop my skills even further and grow both on and off the field.

The same can be seen in the lives of other athletes",1
"Students without distractions can gain more knowledge. Students while they are working independently, can managed their time by completing their assignment. Final, students learning depends on how much effort they put on their learning.. Students focus more.

Working alone is beneficial for students because students challenge them self. Students can ask the teacher if they need support. Students learning developed by focusing more in class and avoiding any distraction, so students can have better grades. Students challenged them self.

In conclusion, students learn many things by working alone. Students can work on their assignment at home and they can be more independently. Students can have more support and ideas from others in groups; however, students works better alone than in groups. Working alone is beneficial for students because students can finish on time, focus more, and challenge them self.

Working alone is beneficial for students because students can finish on time. Sometimes when students are working in groups they get distracted by other team member and that cause a negative impact in the students learning. Students work better alone rather than in groups. Students can work as slow and fast, as they want. Also, students can learn new vocabulary. Students when they are working alone, learn have to be responsible for their work and collaborate in challenging them self by doing it independently. Students can finish on time.

Working alone is beneficial for students because students can focus more. Students while they are working alone can put more effort on it and being more creative. Students can learn have to be more independently",0
"Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

In my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online.",0
"                                                 . All Im trying to point out is technology is a beneficial element of our life but social-life is not one of them. Once it was used just to power a light bulb, now its used to power our cars, houses, phones, cities, everything you see that is human built has some sort of technology in it.

Finally all these great inventions, all of these dazzling things took our attention and isolated us from the others. One of the main advantages of technology is minimizing the waste of time in simple daily life tasks. nearly everyone loves technology, is it really that beautiful? When i was a kid people used to say ""technology will end our social life."" I didnt believe that then, but now i see what they were trying to say.

Primarily technology's goal is to make certain tasks easier, not to make us anti-social or make us obese. Human is a social creature by it's nature, if something blocks the socializing part of being human it will end badly. Technology has come a far way from where it started. Although it has multiple harmful effects for people, the way to cure those are as easy. Another thing that is a huge problem is people building their life around technology, if they lose that technology they think they'll die. Technology, 21st centuries finest product. Until disasters like those happens we are good to go with waste free energy.

Third of all I think that technology is a great invention for the human kind. Another great thing about harvesting electrical energy is that they are infinite unless a disaster happens and suddenly all our water vaporizes or the sun gets blocked or the wind stops blowing. For example, before technology people used to communicate with mails which took a long time to arrive at the designated place, however currently you can shorten that whole process to only a minute or two. We can harvest electrical energy by solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines. Everyone uses social apps on their phone, and that's a huge issue because that is one of the main reasons of people choosing social media over having conversations face to face.

Secondly, technology has it's pros as it has it's cons. Also with technology we can make waste free houses, cars, planes, and many other things by making them operate with electricity rather than fossil fuels which harms our planet. In my opinion technology has a great potential, and we are not using it to the full potential, we are supposed to use it to make simple task easier, but people are spoiling this potential by instead of making our own food we now order it from a restaurant which is ten times unhealthier. I think that technology is a brilliant invention but also it is a very harmful one for our social life. If we stop building our life around social media or technology, and keep technology as just a secondary communication device. If someone tries to change a creature's nature it will try to avoid it, for thousands of years it has evolved to its current state, and now we are trying to change it..",0
"Although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. Some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. Reasons why students should not have four day week is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parent taking care of their siblings.. An example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. Students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. This adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. However, Elementary schools will end later that High schools or Middle schools. Since school is going to end late. An example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. They will no have time to work and even if, they have the time it's going to be difficult for them. Students need to finish all school assignments. Schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. That will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. Parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. Before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life.

The last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. Parents will not be happy with their kids grades. This adaptation can have good and bad benefits. However, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. A reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings.

One of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. However, going to work for them is not that easy some of them don't have their license yet. Some of them have to walk even take a public bus. After considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources that does not make sense, if students get two more hours of school for four day that means that there is not any conserve anergy or resources because we still using the same five days hours in four days instead five days. However, it can affect some other people lifes.

Another reason is some students have a part-time job. Even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time.

In conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. However, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. An example, is just having four days work or school week",0
"In the future advice can change your life. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience. He knows he has to listen to his heart not his head.

Second, reason is he will have better opinions of advice, than bad ones. The older people are also wiser too.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because the person will know which advice to choose. He also knows if it's smart, or not. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience.

First, reason is he will know which advice to choose. He will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. It's difficult digestion to make, but when you seek multiple opinions you will choose the better choice.. His mom has more experience. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because he will know which advice to choose. Imagine taking advice from two people, which person should you choose? Asking advice from two people is a hard digestion to make, but he will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. For instance, if seeking advice from his mom ans his best friend he would choose his mom's advice. For example, if he asks advice from his best friend and his friend he would go with his best friend's advice because that is his gut feeling. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones",0
"With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.

Secondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.

The student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they've learned. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he'd rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn't happen. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager's attention and can also encourage cheating. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.

Initially, cellphones would draw too much of student's attention. Many are addicted to social media, and have the ""need"" to check it every 10 minutes. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn't really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help.. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.

However, it could be helpful and very easy to set up",0
"

Alternatively, I witnessed the opposite situation when someone I knew set a goal that they were unable to reach. They felt a sense of failure and disappointment quite keenly and I could see how this had the potential to discourage them from doing things that were outside of their comfort zone. In order to meet this goal, I had to commit to regular running and to gradually increase the duration and intensity of my runs. Although growing requires a degree of risk and vulnerability, it is those who take such risks and step outside of their comfort zones who find the greatest rewards.. With persistence, I was able to achieve my goal and even surpass it. I discovered a huge sense of satisfaction and accomplishment from pushing myself beyond my physical and mental limitations. 
I have personally experienced the empowerment that comes from rising to the challenge of something I have never done before. Despite their initial enthusiasm for their goal, they eventually lacked the confidence and perseverance to stay committed to the goal. I once set a goal of running a half marathon, a goal that seemed lofty and daunting given that I was a beginner runner. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is highly applicable here",1

However, finishing high school early can also lead to stress. Therefore, students should weigh their options carefully and decide what is best for them.. However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider, including stress and a lack of elective classes. 

In conclusion, it is an individual choice whether or not to finish high school early. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships. Furthermore, those who enter the workforce at an earlier age may have more opportunities for professional development and career advancement, as they have a longer period of time to build their experiences and skills. In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load. 
Completing high school in three instead of four years is certainly a tempting idea, as it shortens the amount of time that students spend in school if they wish to enter college or the professional workforce early. 

On the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. Many students rely on elective courses to gain knowledge in areas they are passionate about, so this can be a problem if there isn’t sufficient time. While there are some potential advantages, such as taking advantage of college or career opportunities, there are also possible drawbacks, such as increased stress and lack of elective courses",1
"I think we should have phones in school only when we have free time on our own and when we are in class we should finish our assignment first and that's when we should have phones out. Including our music we would like to here it only when we are taking a test or we are doing an assignment quite and that you wont bother any people. If we abandoned the phones they would still not follow direction so why even try to abandoned them, that's why I say we should allow the school to have phones out in there free time and if they catch us with the phones they should not take them away. They should just say can you please put your phone away.",0

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. You will never grow into something you want to be in the future if you don't find your inner indite. They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. Different things can have an impact in your life, but that's how we all stated from very beginning; we never known we had a special talent until we try something new.",0

Choosing a career at a young age can be a difficult and impactful decision. It's important to consider the practicalities of the job, such as the level of education required and potential earnings. Making a commitment to a particular profession can open exciting doors and opportunities, but it can also lead to feelings of obligation and higher stress levels. Of course, students need to explore all of their options and understand the pros and cons of committing to a particular career. It's important to maintain a sense of independence and autonomy while still making sound decisions for the future.. For high school students looking to start down a career path, course selection should be based on what will ultimately lead to success in a chosen field. It's also worth taking into account the potential emotional and financial effects of such a commitment on both the student and their family",1
"As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages .

I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change. . I think we can't compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work.

To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school don't have to follow,

First,

we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and that's not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students.

Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school.

Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things,

so they will not have time and that's will be a reason why they can left the school.

Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time.

Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they can't do all.

People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week.

Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit.

One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off.

Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they don't have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do.

students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn.

Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do.

all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day.

In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages ",0
"For example,some individuals that deal with other people always has to give a great impression the first time. For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance.

Finally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. All in all, people have to do their best the first time even if life is too difficult because time does not come back.

In addition, Individuals can lose opportunities by their first impressions. All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities.

However, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble.

People always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time. Additionally, people that works at a restaurant has to have a good appearance because if they do not have it they will lose costumers,lose their jobs. Should the first impressions care and show who individuals are? First impressions are almost impossible to change that is why people always have to worry about their actions because people can not go back the time, can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble.

First of all, people can not go back the time and try to fix what they had done wrong. For example, some individuals who gave a bad impression in their first time at work because they did not how to deal with the costumer and they had a bad attitude but then the next day they realized that they have to change their attitude it may be too late because the costumers already complained. What would be if all individuals make a bad impression the first time?. There are great reasons for always make a good impression the first time because individuals can not go back the time,can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble. For example, some people may regrets how they were in high school with their teachers but they can not do nothing now because some of their teacher already past away",0
"Therefore if you have communication you don't have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. This helps expands the thought process as many can see a different perspective on things. Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes I'm here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isn't bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what they're working towards the same goal. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!. It's actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didn't even know they could think of such thing,that's why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome.

Personally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient.

I have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills.

However,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well that's okay but wouldn't you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldn't you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think they're too good for everyone. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Also a group is not always a maximum group of 5-7 people it can also be about just 3 maybe even two.

Group work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal.

Group work isn't always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,It's more of letting people get their thoughts out",0
"Guidance from those who have been in similar situations or have similar goals and interests can offer more accurate advice and help people take the right steps to achieve their goals. Guidance can help widen one’s perspective, provide reassurance, and help make the most informed decisions possible. By providing support and encouragement, guidance can help give someone the confidence to make decisions and move forward. 
Making decisions is an essential part of life, and seeking guidance when making them can help people be successful and achieve their goals. 

Seeking guidance from trusted sources is important in making sure decisions have a positive outcome. Guidance can also help break through indecision. With the help of guidance, people can be more successful in life and achieve their dreams.. Guidance can provide insight into potential pitfalls and unfavorable consequences, allowing one to make more informed decisions and avoiding costly mistakes. Seeking guidance from someone with a different perspective can help broaden one’s understanding of a situation and provide a better perspective on how to proceed. 

Guidance can provide reassurance in knowing one’s decisions are sound",1
"I think we can't compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work.

To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school don't have to follow,

First,

we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and that's not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students.

Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school.

Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things,

so they will not have time and that's will be a reason why they can left the school.

Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time.

Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they can't do all.

People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week.

Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit.

One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off.

Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they don't have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do.

students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn.

Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do.

all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day.

In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages . As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages .

I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change. ",0
"Those man and woman that are serving our country they had a hard call to make. We are also leaning but at the same time we also teaching it to others these skills are not useful. we don't need to tell our child to be followers there are leaders by teaching them these skills make a big impact . we are people and no one is perfect we would learn everyday until we get old never stop seeking answers and always share your ideas to everyone. never be fare of asking we here to Lean everyday.

Leaders always seek help too they start off small but over the time the income until one point you have all knowledge you need but still to this day we still ask question grab more information.

we can compare these skills and source to our family,jobs,lifestyles.

It's not only students that need it .Having self-reliance and seeking guidance by seeking more information make us better in our jobs,lifestyles. Seeking help and guidance make a huge different .Not only one mind that is speaking but there should be more so we talk and decade bout the issue and we can give more ideas and information",0
"However, there is an ongoing debate about whether schools should be in control of which activities their students take part in. On the other hand, students should be the ones ultimately in control of what activities they take part in, as such activities can be an important source of personal growth and development. On one hand, schools should be able to have somerestriction in the activities students participate in in order to ensure their students are safe and they can practice proper supervision. 
Extracurricular activities offer a range of valuable benefits to students, such as improving college admissions, providing opportunities for scholarship funding, developing time management skills, and helping students develop personal interests. It is important for students to be able to make informed decisions about the activities they engage in, as those activities ultimately have an impact on their future. Overall, it should be the students who have the final say on the extracurricular activities they choose to participate in, as it may be integral to their development.",1

I prefer to work in a group is becouse will can share ideas and opinions that way will be get better grade, Another examples will be, every one in the group will found diferent information and that way we can pick the better information before to proceeding to writng and finich the work.

And another hand my central opinion to work in group will give you the best beneficial because if one of the student get sick the other student can continued to work, that way we can not stop working. Generic_Name

Thank you. And alway work together will supported the idea with the specific information,

Another importan examples is if you working in group you can asked to you group for help, you can shere the work, either one in the group can provide the better ideas and following information in order,

that way all together we can planned the work before writing.

Athoner reason for work in group in my personal opinion is feel more beneficial because you not work alone, that way is less stresfull for each student because every one share the work.

And some time for one reason one of the student has a emergency and the position the best option is work in group because will be more beneficial for each student and the way all the rest of the group can countinued wokt.

and still whole group will be get same grade, however they work together in the group.

In conclusion working with a group is the best, in my personal opinion, I prefer to work in group because the way I improve my work,

working in group is the better way to work because we has many benefits like share ideas, imformation, etc,

and the end I hope you prefer aech student has to keeping work in group.

"We as teenagers are not suficient mature to take a wise decision and mostly we as teenagers take the wrong path for not being wise enough or not having knowledge about how to take an important decision for our life without noticing how damage are our bad decision for us, and how much we can hurt ourself by not knowing how to handle it. Our decisions hurt people we love even though you don't want to hurt them because we let our impulse control us, and because of those decisions we hurt ourself and we hurt others by not realiazing that we push back our family and friends. People should seek guidance from experts because they can help you to make a wise decision. Experts can show you how valuable its our life and how much we have to appreciate it. For example, sometimes we as a person take bad decision that isn't favaroble for our life; but our guidance as our parents, mother or father give us advice to not take a wrong decision, and we have to follow their instructions because they're wiser than us, and they help us for our goods, so they don't see us ruining our life by ourself. . Your decisions makes you grow as a person, but also make you find yourself, your decision are the ones that makes you be who will you be in the future, so you decide who you are gonna be.

In concluision, be wise about your decision get help from a person with more experience, and don't let your bad decision to define who you are, be yourself always following the correct path",0
"Nevertheless, the potential for online school to help both those with disabilities or illness and the economy, should not be discounted. The potential benefits of online school are manifold—it can make higher education more accessible to students with disabilities or illnesses, provide a more flexible learning environment for students, and open up opportunities for them to gain employment. The prevalence of technology in every home is not a given, thus access to computers and the internet can be quite a challenge for many students, particularly in some socio-economic communities. With the right technological infrastructure and support, online school could become an option for all school districts, allowing students to access educational opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable.. 

The advent of online school has ushered in a new era for young scholars. On the other hand, some drawbacks of online school should not be overlooked",1
"This allows students to still take courses in their chosen field without having to leave work or even their own home. 

Given the many benefits of online classes, all students should take advantage of this opportunity when available. By taking these classes, students have the potential to expand their capabilities and better prepare themselves for further education or even a career in a promising field. 

Despite the many advantages of online classes, some people believe it is a waste of time. This also makes it easier for people to reach their educational goals and progress in their career without having to rely solely on conventional learning. 
One of the benefits of online classes for students who have difficulty coming to school or those who work is that the classes are available in the evening. Furthermore, studies have suggested that students who take online classes often have an easier time comprehending material due to the interactive nature of the classes.  Ultimately, online classes provide an accessible way for anyone to enhance their education while still attending to their daily responsibilities.. However, when courses are properly designed and planned, they can provide an effective learning experience",1
"Some people said that working in a group it's more fun than working alone but I think that working alone some times can be also fun because you make your own rules and use your own imagination.

In conclusion, students should work alone, each students can be working by their self and with out thinking if their classmate is going to help in any kind of project, all students has different ideas, working in group would be more stressed for the student, working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade. Finally, students can work for their self, and is not always necessary to work in group, sometimes work in group can be annoying and distractive by others students.. Working alone is the best choice, teachers considerate students ideas like the most big new option to improve our society, working alone is the best way to show our own ideas, by working alone students will be feel more confident about their work and more likely to explain their work. Dears, teachers of Generic_School.

First, I think that we all should work alone, because each student can be working for their self with out any other help from students that do not care about their projects or homework, all students has different ideas, working in a group would be more stressed for the student, they may not have the opportunity to show their own ideas working in a group. In addition, working alone can be the best way to show our own ideas because everyone has different opinion about the projects or the homework and how is going to be, working alone should be more helpful for the student who had different opinion in their topic.

In my English class we all were working in groups, well in my group were three people one of the group was at their phone seen social media, and doing nothing, I ask if he needs help and if that was the reason why you are not helping us to do our project, I said, he just answer and said don't ask me, that's not your problem, he was unreasonable but there wasn't nothing more that I can do for someone who do not want to work, that's one of the a lots of reasons why is not helpful working with a group.

Wherever, I believe that working alone is the best way to show up our mind and be sure that we can do all that we want to do, some people think that working in a group they can get done more fast any projects but I think that we should work alone because there is some people that do not care about their subjects and sometimes the teachers think that they just do not want to do nothing but there are people that we really want a good grade, working alone let the student to focus more in their own work than someone who is stressed about if his partner is going to help or not. However, working in a group sometimes can be helpful but working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, working alone, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade, working in a group one of the persons can be the only one who does all the work",0
"These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they weren't good enough didn't just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. In conclusion, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path.

When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career.

Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like they've had, who later became the best. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be. They've taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, they've given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts.

However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others",0
"It is important to consider someone's feelings even when we are not in a good mood. Not only will treating others with respect and kindness help to create harmony, but it can also lead to beneficial outcomes as well. Respect for others should be at the core of our interactions and is necessary for success in life. 

In summary, treating people with respect, regardless of age, country, or religion, is essential for life success. This could mean better relationships with friends and family, improved career opportunities, and increased respect from those around us. People will be more likely to help us out and return the favour when we treat them well. The attitude we have towards others can have both beneficial and negative outcomes, so it is best to be respectful and kind.. It's important to remember that respect and kindness go a long way, even when you don't feel like it. However, this could have a negative effect on our relationships, causing more tension and anger. 

When we are in a bad mood or feeling stressed, it can be easy to forget about other people's feelings and take out our frustrations on them. 
Respect is an important value that should be shared by all people regardless of age, country, or religion. 

When we show respect and consideration for those around us, it can lead to good outcomes",1
"My lack of self-confidence kept me from taking action and kept me from fulfilling a potential passion. Instead, I remained in my comfort zone, and my hesitation to take the risk caused me to remain inthat area and to miss out on an amazing opportunity.. 

I believe the reason I was unsuccessful with participating in the school theater productions was because I was afraid of failure and I didn't have enough confidence in my own abilities. I knew that if I auditioned, I would likely be cast in a smaller role, and I was afraid I wouldn't do well enough. In addition, my friend would have likely been proud to see me giving it my all and succeeding. I talked to a close friend who was very passionate about theater and I could see that they wanted to encourage me to audition, but I couldn't work up the courage to actually do it. I had been very interested in the school's theater department, but I was too intimidated to audition for any shows. 
My essay will be about a situation two years ago when I was a junior in high school. If I had pushed myself to step outside my comfort zone, I believe I could have achieved success.

If I had made a different decision two years ago and taken the risk of auditioning, it is possible that I could have gained a greater understanding of theater and my own skillset",1
Sometime people want advice when they need help because they can't make the right decision or probably because they are going through something rough in there life. When making a decision you need to think about will my decision effect others or myself? or does it benefits them or me? sometimes people need advise then they are making a decision because sometime when making decision it can be challenging. Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone? Opinions can help people by seeing the persons point of view and understand the persons view. Sometimes its better to ask multiple people for in advice because everyone thinks differently and you will probably get more different advise from people because the more people you ask for in advise then you will get more advise from people. What does advice help people for advice can helps in many ways like to not give up in things people try not giving up so they use advice sometime people just need a motivation in advice that can also be inspirational to some people advice can be very inspirational and that can help them be success in the future sometimes people need advice to help them get motivated advise can be used in many ways sometimes you will probably not get the advice that you want from people but Seeking multiple opinion that can help them answer their question multiple opinion can help someone see the other person point of view and understand easily and know in what they need to improve on next time. . Sometimes people need in advise to help them make a better choice sometimes people need advice to help to let them know in what they need to work on or improve on next time. Sometimes its even better to ask someone for in advice that has had in experienced of something that you might not be experienced with like going through something rough people will understand you because the have also been like that or you just feel worry about something or because you are curious or interested about something and you want to know or want to try something new for the first time,0
"Asking them can help me choose college that are not so expensive. It's always better to ask more people than one so you don't make a mistake.

College means independent life, before graduating high school, ask more people for advice! Everyone have different opinions, choose which one is best and which one will help you the most!. They also warned me to be careful and surround myself with people that will bring positive change in my life. Comparing my parents advice with my friends, obviously, my parent's advice are much better. She can suggest which college suits me the best. After hearing from them, I asked my friends what they would do. They told me they would party all night and drink alcohol. From hearing that, I might add SCHOOL_NAME to my list. Finally I'll ask my counselor where I should go, since she knows what my strength are and what my weakness are. Then i'll ask my siblings what they did after high school. I'll ask my mom and dad to see how much money we have. They told me in college, studying is way more important than socializing. Since you don't know whether the advice is good or not, its better to listen to different opinions from different people, in order to make better decisions.

For example, in four year i'll be going to college.When i'm choosing which college to go to, I will ask several people for advice. Hearing those advice from different people can help me choose the best college to attend.

After I enrolled in college, I will ask my parents for advice. Asking alot of people for advice is always a great idea. One of them is planning to attend SCHOOL_NAME soon, and he told me that is a really good college for studying law",0

To create a character of your own design, the first step is to determine the role that you want this character to have. It is important to become confident in the decisions that you make and try to plan for future decisions when it comes to your character. 

Furthermore, you should also think of ways to reach the goals that you set for your character. Doing research into the challenges they may face and how to become the person you envisioned can help you create a realistic character with achievable goals. What steps do you need to take in order to get there? Consider how your character's choices will be perceived by others and how this could affect the success of reaching their goals. Do you want them to be a hero or a villain, a bystander, or a leader? Once you have established their role, you can then begin to define the character's motivations and personality traits.  After carefully considering all these aspects, you can begin to draft your vision for the character.",1
"It is up to each student to do their research, assess their skills, and make a conscious decision about whether taking classes online is the best choice for them.. Remote learning does not always offer the opportunity to meet and collaborate with other students, and students must be completely self-motivated and organized in order to be successful online. From the convenience of their own home, students are able to work on their studies at their own pace and often with more flexibility in their schedules. This is especially beneficial when it comes to those with other commitments or responsibilities. 
Taking classes online offers a unique and possibly more advantageous learning experience to students. It is important to speak with a school counselor or educational advisor to fully understand the pros and cons of taking classes online, as well as taking a test to assess one's readiness for remote learning. Taking classes from home could allow more opportunities for free time, consistent concentration, and the ability to work on coursework at one's own pace. That said, if you choose to pursue online classes, there are a plethora of potential rewards. Additionally, many students can even make gains in terms of grades by taking their classes online. However, taking classes online also comes with some cautionary notes",1
"In addition to comfortable weather, having the necessary equipment for playing is also important. 
Playing basketball in the right environment is essential for optimizing the game experience, from summer days to indoor court. With the right environment, equipment, and skills, you can make the most out of your basketball experience.. This includes a ball, court, pole and basket, net, and any other items you may need. The ideal temperature for playing basketball is usually around 17 to 32 degrees Celsius, as any higher or lower can affect gameplay. Times of the year that are most suitable for basketball are generally during the summer months, when the weather is warmest and outdoor courts are in optimal condition. Finally, having the right skills and knowledge of the game can make all the difference in your basketball performance",1

Another reason is people have depressing life or have health issuer.

"Because is more helpful for them they get help from their teachers. If students take classes at home they might have some issues.

For example from my point of view I think students should come to school. Because is not going to benefit them with their work. Students need to communicate with others to gain more experience.

a lot of students needs help with one person to support them with their work. Some students are not smart enough to work by their-self. They communicate with others share their thoughts. Some students have bad attitudes and they dont like been with others or forced to talk. I think students should not be able to take classes at home. If their having problems with their assignment they can ask for help.

however some students are not agree to come to school because they might not like to wake up early every morning or deal with others. Sometimes students dont know how to do their assignment assigned. But it is more important to come to school because it benefits you gain more experience.",0
"He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes.

My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them.

Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasn't a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who won't take this seriously.

I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don't have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren't prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can't happen because we are the future.

In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn't do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don't have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases.

As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference",0

"It's all ways good that we, or someone know how to handle it. Enjoyable is that someone can talk to their partner or teammate. Being in groups of teams or just a group of people in activites, makes the groups work together. Studying is a great reason why we can do fun activities with the subject someone wants to relearn, practices, or just for the feels of it.

Participating on an activities, sports is a great why to participate, not only that is good for the heath, but to socializes. It helps the brain work a little harder then other basic stuff that aren't educational.    .

People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because im always busy during the week. I don't think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service because they might have other thinks to do with their family's. The principals should make the people who act bad during the week and during the weekend that will probably help them change a lot they gonna get tired of picking up litter and doing community service.. In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too,0
"Evidence suggests that when individuals take time out of their day to extend compassion and help towards strangers or loved ones, it can completely transform the lives of those that receive it. Whether big or small, any act of kindness can have a powerful and lasting effect on both parties.. He immediately stopped his jog and offered to help the woman carry her shopping on the rest of her journey. Shane was out for a jog one day when he saw an elderly woman struggling to carry her shopping bags home. It is said that one random act of kindness can ripple out and create a positive impact that can reach hundreds or even thousands of people.

An example of this can be seen in a recent online story of a man named Shane Brooks. Examples of these acts can range from holding the door open for someone, offering compliments, writing someone a thank you note, or simply helping a stranger in need. They often emphasize the feeling of togetherness between individuals and also restore faith in humanity. Moreover, showing kindness to others is a powerful way of connecting with them on an emotional level that can create lasting bonds and long-term relationships. Although this simple act of kindness initially seemed small, it demonstrated a significant amount of compassion for the woman. Individuals can experience long-lasting feelings of vulnerability, appreciation, warmth, or well-being when they are beneficiaries of a kind and genuine gesture. In response to his act of kindness, the woman gave Shane a hug and thanked him for his help. This incident shows how small acts of kindness can have an empowering and immediate effect on those around us.

The power of kindness is an emotion and force that should never be underestimated. 
Small acts of kindness can have an incredibly profound effect on others. Experiencing kindness in the form of words, recognition, or appreciation, to name a few, can have a hugely positive impact on our mindsets and sense of well-being.

In summary, small acts of kindness have the potential to have a huge impact on those who experience them",1

Online classes have been gaining in popularity among high school students. Students may have limited access to tutors and course support. However, they may also be at risk of failing the course if they lack the necessary discipline and self-motivation.. They may also miss out on the social and collaborative learning opportunities that traditional classrooms provide. Taking online classes from home can provide students with numerous advantages. This allows them to schedule additional time for extracurricular activities or leisure, such as joining a local sports team or exploring new hobbies. Furthermore, students may lack the motivation and self-discipline to successfully complete an online course.

For example, a student may take an online math course that allows them to complete courses in their own time. They can study in their own time, from the comfort of their own home, and can have more control over the speed at which they complete their courses. This increases flexibility and allows students to pursue other activities with the extra time saved, such as participating in extracurricular activities or setting aside more time for leisure.

At the same time, there are drawbacks to taking online classes",1
"Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.

Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!

Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.

The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.

Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. You can take your classes when ever you are free. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready.

It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job",0
"With online classes, students are able to learn at their own pace, on their own schedule, without having to adhere to set classroom times. Additionally, there may be an increased potential for distraction and reduced motivation for students who are not held accountable for attendance or class participation. Additionally, virtual instruction can open up access to a wider variety of course offerings that may not typically be available in local schools. 

On the other hand, there are some potential cons associated with online learning, especially in K-12, which include a lack of face-to-face interaction and physical presence. 
One potential pro of students taking online classes from home, especially in K-12, is the convenience and flexibility it offers. Likewise, without the physical presence of an instructor, the learning environment may not be as engaging for students.",1

After-school tutoring can improve student achievement and help them understand their homework more effectively. With the support of teachers, parents, and after-school tutors, students can see their academic performance improve and have the opportunity to realize their learning potential.. Through attentive student-teacher instruction, students can benefit from a better understanding of the material they are studying. However, after-school tutoring sessions can be burdensome for some students due to the time it takes away from their free time.

"This is why it is so important to give off the right impression, as it can have far reaching impacts on forming relationships, establishing your reputation, and helping you work towards achieving your goals.. Active listening, being present in the conversation, and cultivating genuine interest from your conversation partner are all great ways to make an effort in shifting the impression of yourself. Additionally, following up after a meeting and striving to improve the relationship over time can help in changing someone’s initial impression of you. 

To try and change a person's first impression, it is important to be aware of the situation before you enter and to take cues from the environment. 

Ultimately, it is clear that your initial impression on another person can have a lasting effect. 
First impressions are incredibly important, as they can shape the way a person thinks about you and your reputation for potentially long lasting effects. Making a strong first impression is the key to fostering subsequent relationships, as making a bad impression can be difficult to change. People often have a hard time altering their personal opinion of someone after a single encounter, as they are driven by emotions and memories that can be difficult to overcome",1
"In all the schools spend a lot of energy using; cell phones, internet or using the computers doing test, works or homeworks. It is a lot of things that schools can use and the principal thing that school are using is energy. They have a lot of time to make more proyects maybe better ideas to how conserve the energy.

In all the cases the people, students, and teachers are not agree to extending the school day two hours. The meaning of this is to save all the energy that we can. And then conserve some of energy.

In this case we can created proyects that help better to try to not spend a lot of energy in fact to try to conserved. If all the schools are agree about to extending two hours more, then they are braking the rule to converse more energy and resources. It is probable that students and teachers are not agree to extending the school day two hours.

First, the schools don't need the follow that model and also to extending the school day two hours. Teachers can help to support to the students creating more ideas or proyects.

Maybe is not going to change as how much energy we are using, but it is some that helps to reduce the energy, the point is to try to conserve the energy that we are using.

At this point to conserve energy and resources schools can follow that model, extending tha school day two hours. In the school office all the teachears are working all the time making copies, works and they are doing a lot of files.

Second, it's not necessary to extending two hours more in the schools, students can do campaigns to how reduce the energy or making groups of people and try to do things that help to conserve more energy. To sharing the campaings to anothers students",0
"Being able to land an internship soon after graduating early was difficult, but the time I had to prepare made it possible for me to stand out during the interviewing process. Research has shown that the benefits of graduating early include a greater likelihood of continuing a higher education, more time to explore interests and hobbies, and improved job prospects for the future. 

For example, graduating from high school early is a surefire way to get a head start on your college career. Furthermore, this extra time is beneficial in exploring internships and other professional opportunities that aren't available to traditional students.

I can personally attest to these advantages, as I was able to use my extra time to gain experience in my field by training in a professional agency. 
Graduating early from high school can lead to greater success in the long run. With an extra year or two to spare, many early graduates go on to attend trade schools, universities, or pursue creative interests without the pressure of finishing a diploma. Benefits such as more available time to pursue higher education and professional endeavors, give early graduates a great starting point.. By putting myself in this position, I believe I had an edge alongside other graduating high school peers.

"By adding an extra year of high school, a student can adjust their studies to ensure a successful transition.
 
In conclusion, for those looking to make the most of their high school experience, four years is often the right choice. Extracurricular groups, such as student government or volunteer organizations, provide the opportunity to work together with like-minded peers. With the flexibility of additional courses and the security of academic protection, graduating high school in four years gives students the opportunity to reach their full potential and transition seamlessly into the next stage of their life.. 
 Graduating high school in four years, rather than three, is often the better choice for students in search of a fulfilling educational program. Missing credits or a low GPA can carry serious repercussions when it comes time to apply to college. Not only does the fourth year offer more opportunities to take interesting classes and extracurricular activities, but it also provides added protection against academic struggles, such as poor grades or a lack of credits.

For starters, the fourth year of high school provides additional time for students to enhance their education. Electives and extra study courses can be taken, allowing students to further specialize in their areas of interest. With the buffer of a fourth year, these issues can be addressed in a manageable and stress-free way. These activities offer a highly enriching learning experience, and give students the tools they need to achieve their aspirations.

"It can disrupt our enthusiasm and zest for life, and can lead to unhappiness, unrestrained stress, and difficulty in achieving goals. With a positive attitude, we can embrace opportunities and rise above our failures. However, a positive attitude can help us remain conscious and aware, standing strong even through life’s hardest struggles.

In contrast, having a positive attitude allows us to discover and nurture our best qualities, as well as enabling us to lead a constructive life. It helps us to focus on solutions, not problems, and gives us the strength to stay resilient in times of stress and difficulty. It is easy to allow negative thoughts to take control and to become consumed by them. One of the most essential tools for success is having a positive attitude. We become more resourceful and creative, as well as capable of achieving our goals.

In summary, having a positive attitude is essential to living a successful life. Positive thinking can help us resolve any situation in a flexible and composed manner, allowing us to find joy and happiness in the face of adversity.. 
Living a successful life requires more than talent, luck, or hard work. A positive attitude can bear remarkable results, while a negative attitude can act as a major roadblock.

I remember when my sister was confused , because she didn't know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her ,because she believe herself ,she take the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue fordward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted ,but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fail. she was very sweet ,kind , and lovely woman that i have ever meet in my life , she use to call me grandaugther and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that lives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say good bye comes, I was really sad because I would not be able to see her again ,but after she left I would always remember the words that she tell me; ""I'm living ,but dont worry because you would always be in my heart ,and i will always have in present everytime that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I learn that when you do something no matter what it is you will always receive something back and that something it can change your life forever.

We get more by doing something ,because if we want something and we work hard to get what we want , we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that ,if we put our effort we can get what we want. that's something I will remeber the rest of my life.

We get more by doing more ,because every single time that we do something ,no matter what it's we are going to get something back ''recompense''. ""Getting something by doing something or doing nothing also bring us something""

We accomplish more if we are always doing something ,because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing ,everytime that we do something no matter what it's we receive something back ,many people called ''reward"" , when we want something and we work hard to get that, we create a confidence in ourself's that we now that by doing something we can get what we want and we motivate ourself to accomplish that. we get more if we do more ,but some people think that by doing nothing you can get something back . when you take your time to do something with patience , will ,and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back ,we have that selfsatisfaction of making someone happy. accomplishment is something that you get by working hard , giving your best ,and by doing something about it , if we dont do anything we aren't going to accomplish anything or get anything in this life .

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing more. confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in , it would help you when you are struggleling to take a important decision that maybe it can change your life. Sometimes we have to take that fear of failling out of our lifes ,and bring that confidence that would help us to belived in ourself's.

Getting more by doing something, is better than don't do anything expecting that we are going to get something.

By doing something we will always be growing more than what we are , we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another person's , and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it. like when you see a poor child walking in the streets ,looking for food in the trash ,bacause he is hungry and he doesn't have money to buy some food or maybe he doesn't have a mom that can feed him and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food , because you have that feeling of helping him and make him happy once. one time I remember that I went with my mom to work , we went to clean a house of a 79 year old woman that the only company that she had was her dog , so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day , and I didn't know that this woman would became someone special for me. like when you are at school and you have alot of assigments to do ,but you still motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done and you make the effort to continue until you are done, that's when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that "" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". It's important for people to know that in this life they can have the opportunity to accomplish everything that they want tio improved their life ,but also at the same time they have to know that to accomplish something they have to work hard , have confidence, and they get everything they want in this life.",0
"The curfew rule is an outstanding rule and I think more city councils should adopt it as well.. This is for the teenagers to be safe and not be out late because something could happen to them if they are out on the streets at night. For an example, if your teenager stays home and doesn't go out passed his curfew then he or she won't get hurt or even worse shot by a dangerous person . I do not think they interfere with young peoples life but keep them safe from anything happening to them , keep them from breaking the laws and getting in trouble by the police .My three main reasons from having a curfew were to keep them from doing anything illegal, to keep them from getting hurt or killed,

to keep them from doing graffiti on buildings and walls, and makes the parent communicate with the teenager and see what they are doing .One last important thing is to always communicate with your teenager because they want your help but deep down they won't ask for it , so it's important to check up on them once an awhile and see how they are doing.

This is why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule . The city council is debating on having curfews for teenagers, weekdays they have until 10 p. This could prevent teenagers from getting in trouble and prevent people from cleaning up the teenagers own mess. Instead of doing those things , just talk to your loved ones, friends, and family on the phone or play with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

As a result, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends is important because this could prevent anything from happening to your teenager. This rule won't interfere with young peoples life, it would keep them safe at home and their parents don't have to worry about them doing anything bad. This rule would be an outstanding one because they can cause less trouble and they can stay out of trouble at the same time. We don't know what our kid could be doing passed curfew so I think we need this curfew so we can make sure they are not doing anything illegal. You won't have to worry about them that much because you know they are safe at home and won't try to get you in a serious problem. If the city council adopt the curfew rule they can prevent your son or daughter from getting beat up or getting shot . m and on the weekends they have until midnight. If you have talent to draw amazing objects then try showing it in school or on your personal items and not on the cities property. For an example ,If your teenager was caught doing illegal things and doing it passed curfew , it would be extremely terrible and your teenager would be in a whole lot of trouble. If your teenager has some bad friends, tell your kid to stop talking to them because they might try forcing him or her to do something that they do not want to do. To demonstrate, If your teenager is not out on the street then he or she can be drawing or painting on paper instead of doing graffiti on building or walls . The city council can't really do anything about your teenager sneaking out from your house so you are responsible for watching your kid.

My second reason why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule is to keep your teenager from breaking the law and to keep them from doing horrible things. This keeps our kid safe and also out of trouble because its horrible to be drinking and doing drugs. The teenagers can be talking to their friends, loved ones, and family on their phone or be playing with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

My first reason why I think they should the adopt the curfew rule is because it keeps them at home and keeps them safe. This rule can prevent anything dangerous happening to your son or daughter, this will keep them inside and they can study, catch up on miscomplete assignments , and do homework. This is why having a curfew and checking on your kids room once in awhile will help you prevent this from happening and also keep your teenager from having a black out, crashing or a overdose. It's also your job as parents to keep watch out on your son or daughter because they can try sneaking out. If your teenager is caught doing this , he or she is gonna be in a serious problem and they will have to clean it.

My final reason why I think it's important to have a curfew rule is because this will prevent your teenager from doing illegal things such as drinking or doing drugs. I suggest buying a ton of paper or objects that you can paint on instead of doing graffiti on buildings or walls own from the city council",0
"I will agree with this topic I thing that can you be yourself is something can you be on our person and you most constantly our personality so you can be greafull with something you do in your life to be nice person in the future you have to respect to be good person.

First, I thing that be yourself is something can you do in person because if you don't do that so you cannot be good person in your life. This is my reason why you have be yourself because you most have constantly our personality so you can be greafull with something you do in your life to be nice person in the future you have to respect to be good person.. People can do anything to constantly to another people so that's why we need to have most confidential to make sure we need to be kind because that we need yourself to be cleanly and most respectfull and generous be to good person in the future.

Finally. Be yourself is something that's why people in the community don't respect because if yourself have to be accomplishment that's mean the you have something error. So, we need to have most confidential and generous in yourself because you have be sure the yourself nobody to compare to someone else so because you are not good person.

In conclusion. However, you most have nice personality and good respect to someone be yourself and if someone don't have affect so that person is not have good personality.

Another reason. We can do the people don't do like have good and respect to someone you have to be most confidential in yourself because you most be great person to another people in the community that mean you can have make sure people is good with that to be yourself.

"Trying new things can also help us gain valuable knowledge for the future and help us build self-confidence. Learning to cook a new recipe or playing a new sport for the first time can open us up to completely new skills and new talents that we can explore. 

So if you’ve ever wondered how you can become the best version of yourself, start reaching out of your comfort zone and try something new. Or, if we decide to learn an instrument, we can surprise ourselves with our own aural abilities. It may present you with new and unexpected opportunities to grow—and who knows, you just might find a new passion or talent you never knew you had!. By exposing ourselves to new experiences, we can discover talents or skills that we may have never known we had. 
 As we journey through life, it is important to strive to grow in order to strengthen our skills and improve our abilities. Trying new things instead of staying in the same place and never growing is a great way to accomplish this. 

For example, taking a pottery class could open up a whole new world of three-dimensional art that we had no idea we could create",1
"As their brains tire, so does their capacity for learning.

Reason 2: We don't have enough time for personal activities. Such appointments are crucial, and an impossibly long school day could lead to missed opportunities for numerous students. Even if teachers spread out assignments and give manageable homework, a longer school day will result in massive piles of assignments. 
Introduction: 
Longer school days have become a controversial issue as of late. Having a longer school day would mean less free time in the afternoon for students to learn valuable activities, like how to manage their finances, pursue hobbies, cooking, time with family, and much more. 

Reason 3: Too much homework. 

Reason 4: Appointments are missed. While some argue that extending school days would have educational and social benefits, I am against the idea of adding one and a half hour to school days.  

In conclusion, I believe the idea of adding another one and a half hours to school days should be abandoned in favor of shorter days and better educational methods. This essay will detail four main reasons why this should not be implemented. Students and their families may find it almost impossible to juggle appointments, such as counseling, medical, and a range of other services in and around a longer school day. Having a longer school day means more homework for students and puts greater pressure on them. Eight hours is already a long time to spend in school. The additional time taken up by longer school days is unnecessary and could lead to detrimental consequences for both students and teachers.. 

Reason 1: We are already in school for 8 hours and it is too much. Times are different since the introduction of digital devices in education, and children may struggle to focus on tasks and activities so long into the day",1
"With this understanding, I am confident that I will eventually get to the place I want to be and achieve my goals.. I need to evaluate what I can do differently in order to maximize my chances of surpassing all the expectations for the position. 
    
After working hard for the past three years I had high hopes for achieving the coveted supervisor position I was aiming for. But reflecting on my experience, I have now come to understand the importance of failure in the pursuit of success. I know that the pay is higher than my current position, I will have a greater degree of independence, and I would be working in a busy, bustling location. 

I now find myself at a crossroads, pondering if the supervisor position is still the best choice for me. But unfortunately, despite all my efforts I still fell short of the mark. On the other hand, I am aware that the position comes with additional requirements and expectations that I’m not entirely sure I’m ready for.

Weighing out all the pros and cons of the offer, it’s clear that my current actions will determine where I end up. For a moment, I felt a twinge of disappointment",1
"PROMPT

Prompt is somthing that can we done everything but some times somthiny bad can happen, we have to thik fisrt, before to do something.

First in my opinion, for me is bad, because no all time yo can be lat, also if you have excuse or a reason why you are lat, but we have to be prompt, for instanse some times people are lazy, and is not good, por example if you going lat in your job probale lose your work , or if you get up 7:30am in the morning and your bus raisin

7:35am again you lost the bus, according how you are, especially we can be lazy.

Especially always we need to be prompt because is necessary, in different place where you go. you need to be the first person, but no't the all peron are prompt, some people have a excuse,

but we can accomplish if you want, and if you can, also some people have a lot of things to do, but we can meke a calendar, and be more responsible, we can take the time for different things to do, also looking you watch or clock.

Then we can give a good example, prove a good prompt, also one thing in the life, and more important is the promt, but for mi some times is impossible, when I lose the bus school, one thing how to change this, for this get up more early, and take the time, aslo we have 24 hours is so a lot of, we can do the all things, depend how you want to live, if you can't to live runing all time, is because you are lazy or other reason.

"Finally, her hard work paid off and acheived what she wanted to be. My sister decided to be a doctor at a young age and started to focus on that path. People should consider deciding their path in a young age for their own benefit and betterment. . To support this idea, a child decided to be an engineer when s/he was young, but suddenly s/he changed his mind and decided to be a surgeon. Choosing which path should be taken in an early age and preparing for it beforehand, will help a lot for the future. Although some people might argue students should commit to a career later in their life, students should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them to decide for their future early, it makes them focus on a specific goal, and they won't feel more pressured to choose a career later in their life.

To begin critics say that choosing their occupation later in their life is more beneficial because they will be open to more new options later than in a young age. Now, she is a doctor. Should s/he choose what s/he wants to be now or should s/he choose what s/he wanted to be when s/he was young? However, it is obvious that choosing a career later in their life will only make them feel burdensome and their life will only be more intricating.

A more valid argument is that choosing a path to be taken at a young age will let you have a better life in the future. This evidence is valid because preparing for the career in a young will let your life go smoothly, will give more free time in the future, and won't feel pressurized.

Although people might say that students committing towards your career and choosing it at a young age will lead you to a better life because it makes them to focus on a certain goal of their life, will make them decide what they want for the future, and won't feel pressurized to choose their career. For example, a girl started to prepare for the career she had chosen when she was young and started to work hard for that",0
"I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. Dear Principal,

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

Sencerly, YOUR S. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class",0
"we as people should stand up for each other. that effects a lot of peoples lives.

Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. Not away in our houses getting what u want from online and letting people you haven't meet and hadn't meet you determine who or what u are let your friends say what they thing and u tell yourself who and what you are.. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. How nice people are to them .

First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you won't meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun. People shouldn't spend most of there time on devices or inside. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. People can check out books,shop,and play games without speaking to another persons .Has the limitation of human contact due to the technology has positive or negative effects on people's lives? I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. Technology can take over someones life they can be hooked to it. That its self harms the brain all types of ways.

Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. we should get out more and have a community picnic and be with each other. and our population will decrease because of technology.

In Conclusion, what the people are doing isn't right technology shouldn't keep us away from each other. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them",0
"The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. That is why having f our-day work week is a bad idea. This will also effect their grades. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc.                                    . To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless",0

Throughout my life, I’ve experienced many people who were dishonest and inauthentic. With more experience under my belt, I eventually became better at recognizing bad relationships and toxic people. Trying to fit in and please these people was a mistake, as they only brought me down and it was not the healthy environment that I needed to grow and succeed. I discovered that the more I was honest about who I was, the easier it was for me to be surrounded by positive individuals who pushed me to reach my goals and dreams. We have the ability to choose who we invest our time in, and I have learned that it’s better to choose wisely.. Setting boundaries and not putting up with toxic people is the best way to make wiser, healthier relationships in the long run. 
Growing up, my parents instilled in me at an early age the importance of authenticity and honesty. This made me understand the importance of setting boundaries and being comfortable with saying no - something that is still valuable to me today. From a young age, I learned that if I choose to be truthful and honest, I will likely make wiser decisions in life and build better relationships. 

Overall, personal growth and development starts with understanding the importance of being honest and authentic in life",1
"Innate traits are those we are born with, while acquired traits are those we develop over time. Both types of traits shape the way we interact with others, as people often judge us based on our behavior and beliefs.

While it is important to accept our individual traits, it is also important to stand out for ourselves. On the other hand, acquired traits, such as values, hobbies, and interests, are chosen by us and can provide us with a sense of purpose, belonging, and contribute to our self-development.

Each type of trait has its own benefits and drawbacks. We can use both our innate and acquired traits to find and live authentic lives, and by doing so, we can influence others to do the same. Innate traits can be unchangeable, while acquired traits allow us to adapt. 
Individual traits come in two forms: innate and acquired. . We often make decisions based on these traits without much thought. Innate traits can provide stability, while acquired traits give us the opportunity to grow. Our choices have profound impacts on the people around us, and making choices in line with our values can help us create a better world. We are bound to both, and our choices can have profound impacts on how we interact with others.

Innate traits, such as personality type, aptitude, and even outlook on life, are largely a product of genetics and affect the paths our lives take",1

Additionally, having access to different points of view can help people to stay motivated in their pursuit of the best possible solution. This approach has helped him make wise decisions and drive growing success for his organization.

"They should have the patience and attention to detail needed to craft their pieces. The salary for painters in 2018 was estimated at an average of of $44,110. Being honest with yourself about your interests, skills, and needs can help you make an informed decision about which job could be more beneficial for your career path.. 

A stylist professional typically works in salons and tailors their services to the customer's needs, such as coloring, cutting, styling, and more. They need to have strong communication skills, the ability to work with a variety of products, and knowledge of current trends in the beauty industry. If you are interested in utilizing creative skills while interacting with customers, then a position as a stylist may be best for you. The 6-year job growth outlook for painters is expected to grow by 4 percent.

When making the decision of which job to pursue, consider the reasons why you are drawn to each job and how those interests can help you become successful. 
Becoming a stylist professional and painting landscapes are two very different career paths with unique skill sets that need to be considered when making this decision. The median annual salary for stylists in 2018 was estimated at $41,250 and the job is expected to grow 8 percent by 2028.

Painting landscapes as a profession requires a thorough understanding of color, technique, and composition. But if you have a passion for creating art, then painting landscapes could be the ideal career fit. An artist must be able to replicate and depict the world they see, with accuracy",1
"Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. You never know who your going to meet online. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Yes their will be some kids that will learn online and there won't be some people do work better with the person right in front of them.. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help",0
"It can also be beneficial to identify and nurture your passions and engage in meaningful activities. By remaining true to your authentic self, you can stay confident and maintain your integrity, even when facing adversity. The struggles of being yourself can often be compounded for immigrant populations, teenagers, and those who are considered ‘different’. And those who are seen as ‘different’ – whether because of their personal preferences, physical appearance, or anything else – often have to battle against negative stereotypes in order to remain true to themselves.

Despite these difficulties, however, it is possible to be yourself, even in difficult situations. 

Indeed, ‘being yourself’ in less than ideal conditions can be the ‘greatest accomplishment’ of all. It is a difficult but ultimately rewarding feat, one which is worthy of celebration and acknowledgement.. Through these means, it is possible to stick to your values and be your true self in spite of any pressure to conform. For example, immigrant families often have to deal with different cultures, expectations, and norms, which can make it hard for them to stay true to their identity and beliefs. 
In a world filled with expectations, it can be difficult to remain true to oneself. For example, it can be beneficial to surround oneself with people who can support, encourage and motivate you to be your true self, free from judgement. Teenagers, in particular, frequently have to face peer pressure to conform to certain standards and ideals, which again can make it difficult to be their authentic selves",1

Establishing a homework club can provide numerous benefits to students. By offering a dedicated, supportive environment where students can come together to complete their assignments, a homework club can help create a sense of community and camaraderie among classmates. Additionally, the presence of a dedicated space for studying can help students stay focused and motivated to get their work done. With knowledgeable facilitators in attendance, members of the homework club can also seek guidance and support when needed. Many students struggle with feeling isolated or disconnected in large school settings, so clubs like these provide an opportunity for them to form meaningful relationships with peers. Ultimately, homework clubs can help equip students with better academic skills, emotional well-being, and social skills for future success.",1

"Working alone offers them the opportunity to learn to think critically and come up with their own solutions. It also instills a sense of autonomy and responsibility, as there are no other people to depend on to complete tasks. 

Additionally, it can be beneficial for students to work independently. For starters, it can be more efficient since you only have to consider your own needs and preferences. You won't have to waste time trying to work out group dynamics or compromise on decisions. 

Overall, I believe that it is often better for students to work alone than in a group. 
Working alone often has a number of advantages over working in groups. Independence and efficiency are both major benefits that can help to foster an environment of intellectual inquiry and personal growth.. When faced with a challenging problem, the individual is better equipped to simply focus on the task at hand rather than trying to coordinate a group",1

Winston Churchill's quote ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"" is one of the most inspiring quotes of the modern era. This quote spoke to me directly and showed me that failure was just a necessary step in the journey to success. 

I relate to this quote personally; when I was in graduate school, I struggled to keep up with my classes and often felt adrift. To achieve success one must not be discouraged by failure, but to use it as a learning experience and keep going with determination and courage. 

Ultimately, Churchill's quote is a potent reminder that it is never too late to start again and to continue striving for excellence no matter the setbacks encountered. On the other hand, Churchill's quote isn't complete without addressing failure. This encourages individuals to strive for continuous improvement and progress in their lives. On one hand, Churchill's quote highlights the fact that success, while valuable, is not static and there is always more to be done. No matter how difficult the journey becomes, the courage and determination to continue will allow one to eventually reach their goals.",1
"For example on market every people want to down the price of production, the new technology helps on this.

In conclution, technology shows to good change on human's life,

in the economy, in the konwlege and many areas technology helps.. I take this opinion for the chaning on our life and the support positive in the knowledge.

First reason, for saying the the tecnology have good effects on the human's life is it helps to do many activity fast and easy. now with the new technology, we do not need to move. we can bay only.

Second reason, tecnology gives support to the knowledge with the creation of new tools and more precision.

For example, before we used the telescopes for treated to understand the universo, now the technology us helps with the creation of new satellite .

Thrid reason, that support the tnechnology have good effects in our economy. My position about technology is this brings many effect positive for us huminity life. For example, many years ago we had to go the store and we watched the stuffed we need",0
"In these cases, our emotions can become overwhelming, and our go-to strategies for managing our feelings may fail to provide the necessary support. For example, when faced with a material loss, we may choose to face the challenge with resilience and positivity or give up and be consumed by the negative emotions. 

However, it can be exceptionally difficult to keep things from affect us when they are related to family and other matters that are deeply important to us. . Similarly, we can choose how we respond to a situation where someone loses control of their emotions; we can be understanding and patient, or react harshly. 
We have the power to choose our own character traits, which gives us the ability to decide how something that happens to us affects us. Likewise, when a workplace problem arises, we may respond with a problem-solving attitude or remain stuck in the despair. Ultimately, it takes a degree of strength and resilience to work towards keeping from being overwhelmed",1
"Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals",0
"Now I what you might be saying that the students are never going to leave their phones not even if there in class. Dear, Principal

I think that you should allowed the students of your school to use there cell phones when they have the time to.            . The students should have in mind that when the teacher ask them to put it always that they well. Another is if they need help with something and on one is with them . Will this is why I think that allowing the students to have there phones with them is ok. You can assigned any thing to that person like after school clean up or Saturday school something like that so that they know not to do it again and that they need to lessen to the teacher when they are ask to well that is all i have to say principal. But also to remember that they have the right to use them. will there can be a punishment to that person that dose not flow the rules. One because they want to time in school to call friends that may not be in the same school or if they have an important thing to do after school in they can't go",0
"One way that knowledge can lead to financial success is through the creation of something tangible. This knowledge gave Edison the power to discover more technologies and inventions, which, in turn, allowed him to become one of the most successful inventors in history.

Not only did Edison acquire financial success with his inventions, but other inventors and innovators have had the same success in recent years. 
It is widely accepted that knowledge can be a great source of power and success in our lives. Through their knowledge of advanced engineering and usage of the 3D printing technology, inventors have been able to create profitable businesses designing and printing complex products. People who are knowledgeable in a particular field, like finance, business, or marketing, can use their knowledge to their advantage and increase their financial stability. 

Another way knowledge can lead to financial success is through the power that comes with understanding the way the world works. For those who invest the time and energy to learn, whether it be through inventing products or understanding how the markets works, knowledge has the potential to lead to many great opportunities. For example, thanks to the invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison in 1879, he and other inventors were able to make a great financial gain. . Take for example the invention of the 3D printer, which has revolutionized the field of manufacturing. Understanding how the markets work, how a business is structured, and the way people buy and sell products, are all examples of knowledge that can be used to drive financial success.

Ultimately, knowledge is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used in many different ways to create real things, generate financial success, and increase power",1
"Although it is important to remember that there are still potential issues, technology continues to unlock more and more opportunities in our everyday lives that simply didn't exist before.. From intrusive surveillance, to cyberbullying, to the expensiveness of much of the technology available, people must be vigilant in order to maintain a balance between the two.

When it comes to communication, technology has done amazing things to help keep us connected. 
Since the dawn of the technological age, technology has vastly changed the way we live and communicate. And email has been incredibly useful for starting and maintaining dialogue with someone without needing to set aside a large block of time for a meeting or a phone call.

Shopping has also been made infinitely simpler and more convenient with technology. This type of bullying is especially difficult for parents and educators to deal with, since the harmful messages can be so quickly sent and spread.

Overall, technology has had a profound impact on people's lives, both good and bad. It has helped to bridge distances and bring people from all over the world closer together, hath enabled us to share information quickly and securely, and has made it easier than ever to shop for essential items. Cyberbullying, for example, is one of the easiest ways for people to take advantage of the anonymity the internet provides to attack and harass someone without fear of repercussion. Thanks to the advent of the internet, we can now order virtually anything we need from our computers and phones, and it gets delivered right to our doorstep. Social networks, such as Facebook, have made it easier to maintain relationships with people that we may not be able to physically meet up with. This has revolutionized our shopping habits and allowed people to live much more easily and independently.

But as with any powerful tool, technology can also be used for less than altruistic purposes. Video chat services, such as Skype, have clearly made it easier to keep in touch with friends and family who live far away. In fact, without technology, most of the of the conveniences that a lot of us now take for granted—such as dial up internet access, online banking, and shopping through e-commerce websites—would not be available.

However, technology also poses some negative implications to daily life. With increasing access to more powerful, affordable devices, this impact is only going to continue to grow",1
"The goal then to is to learn from past experiences in order to gain the necessary skills to successfully stand up to and prepare for potential embarrassing situations.. It can be said that our past experiences shape our future first impressions, either through how we prepare ourselves or how we interpret the reactions and feelings of those around us. Taking lessons from the past situations and feeling comfortable enough to properly apply them can be the difference between being more confident and successful in our first impressions, or perpetuating embarrassing, and sometimes embarrassing, situations. Every individual has their own set of experiences that shape them, and therefore, the ability to better prepare for these situations will depend on acknowledging our past experiences and using them to form our future actions. 
As humans, we are constantly evaluating, learning, and growing through our experiences. This can be crucial when it comes to embarrassing situations that can happen in social settings",1
"They miss out on that chance. he gave it his best. But you should never give up always give it your best no matter what.

Form trying your best you don't lose any thing you only gain something. you will face problems no matter what path you take. Mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. This not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. you can't follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. For example, My dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. So why should you not give it your best .

No matter who you are, you should take the words of Duke Ellington and try you best when facing a problem.                                                                                                                              . Never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it. For example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. No mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. He did not try his best. he simply gave up. They simply give up. If you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would I have won. You should be always motivated to do your best.

If you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. Unfortunately that not the case. American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, '' A Problem is a change for you to do your best.'' I agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. But adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem. They give up form the start they don't try there best when facing that problem. Does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. If you don't win that game you at least know that you tried your best. There are many more examples you can try to be your best.

Some times adults have to face problem and they don't know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. or trying to achieve you dreams ",0
"Well in soccer games I use communicating,dribbling,passing and shooting.

In my opinion communicating is the most important soccer talent professionals need. There was a player named Ronaldo he played for Generic_City when I was born, so I saw one of his soccer games in the T.V and I looked how he used other skills in the match against Generic_City. Everybody needs communication to win any sport game.

In my opinion you need skills to be good at the game. Like professionals they worked for 5 to 8 hours a day. In one of my games I had to score two goals at least to win the finals in soccer then I two use my skills called the fake. Professionals need communication to score or win a match. So then I started to watch soccer in my T.V..Soccer got famous in the late 1800's. In 1900 professional in different leagues used communication also to pass to ball. I train everyday when that happened to someone.

If everybody tried to play soccer it wouldn't be boring because it's fun, you can play with family members or friends, and you can know new people.. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. Pele was a young Brazilian when he went to the world cup finals, he was only 18. So then I started playing more and more of it, and then I started playing in tournaments and leagues. I started of in defense, then I started to up my way up, so then in three weeks I started playing striker. So then I used one of his skills and it worked. When I started playing soccer I used skills like communication,passing and shooting so then my coach said I had potential in me. In 2008 there was a player called Alex Hunter he was a rookie, then he started training and training until he gotten famous and good at soccer. I also practice dribbling a lot in my soccer practice. For example my soccer team always use communication to pass to even score, and to win the match. Loved to play the sport because It always entertained me. So I saw professional players skills, so I can use those professional skills in a soccer game.

In my opinion you have to work hard and train hard because if I don't I wont be active so those are my other soccer skills because I train to learn moves, running, and defense. Wow! A talent I have is soccer, I have played soccer when I was born. In 2009 there was a player named Lionel Messi he plays for Generic_City and won six ballon d'or. Also in soccer you had to work hard and train hard. I use it a lot in soccer matches and I really good at it. Other professional have to train everyday to win other soccer matches and communicate with other teammates. So I used his skills for two games. He used skills in games and in training. His position was striker, he was known for his bicycle kick in the 80 minute. In my other soccer matches I used skills like passing and dribbling in a soccer matches. I train everyday so I can get better and better",0
"A lot of people tells me that I should get this kind of job, because I dont like when people are irresponsible and since I'm a responsible worker the rest of employers will like how I work, then they will start to their work just like I'm doing mine. That's what I'm trying to change in this job. I'm a responsible guy, who likes to be able to help the others if they need help in anything. I'm always trying to able to do all the work and to help the others if they don't know how to do it. I'm trying to get this job because I know that I can help other people succeed, I can make this work by helping others and by working hard every day.

In conclusion. I'm always on time. So if you need that type of employee I think I'm the right person, because I will work very hard to finish the job by one day. Also I'm a hard worker because I'm constantly doing work, never stopping to do anything else if I'm not do with my work.

First,I think that I'm a responsible worker, because I never stop doing my work until I'm done with it. I like to make other people work hard to, not just me, because if we all work hard we are all going to be successful in this job, I'm not trying to be successful by myself, I like to see more people success in life. Like I said I like to work hard, to finish everything by the same day.               . A lot of employees dont work hard for the job that they have, if they dont work hard, that makes the company or the rest of workers look bad because he doesn't want to do anything. I don't like to many works to be doing at the same time, so I try to finish one per day so later on I wont have to come and start to do the same work I was supposed to finish the day before. I think this are good reasons why I would be a good candidate to be hire for this job, I'm here trying to get this job, so I can help the others to be good workers and help the company look better, because we will work hard and be responsible to make the best out of the best.

Sinceraly.

Generic_Name. Hey dear employees.

I'm writing this letter to tell you about some of my characteristics that are needed for this kind of job. If I want to go out and be with friends, the first thing that I tell them is that I have to finish my work if I have time to go out after work then I will be able to go with them, but if Im not done then I cant go, because the job is the first thing that we all should have in mind, then the second thing are friends, free time, all that kind of stuffs.

Second, I'm a hard worker in any job, because I like to demonstrate that I can do the best and any job at anytime",0
"Ultimately, the potential benefits of a four-day school week must be weighed carefully against the consequences for students with part-time jobs.. While the additional day off could give a student more time to pursue an after-school job, it could also result in fewer hours and less pay due to the extended school day. 
With the implementation of a four-day school week, the conservation of energy and resources could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, costs associated with transportation, such as gas and tolls, and food could be reduced as schools would only be open for four days each week.

However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of a four-day school week, particularly for students with part-time jobs. The extra two hours added to the school day could be used to provide additional instruction and educational activities, which might lead to a more efficient use of resources and energy",1
"With a curfew in place, teens feel pressure to finish up assignments and maintain good behavior in their place of employment or while out in public. 

Lastly, an earlier curfew also helps to prevent teens from getting into trouble. 

In conclusion, the benefits of establishing a 10pm curfew for teenagers far outweigh the alternatives of not implementing it. By providing a set time to be home, curfews offer teens structure and guidance that they need to maintain positive behavior.

Compared to not having a curfew, the advantage of establishing a curfew is that it ensures that teens are home at a set time, and it encourages them to be in the house after dark. A curfew helps to regulate the activities that teens engage in and promote a sense of personal discipline in teens. By having a curfew of 10pm, teens are less likely to be out and about engaging in risky behaviors, such as drinking or drug use. This creates a positive and productive environment that both employers and customers can benefit from. We can all agree that a curfew is an essential tool for fostering discipline among our youth.. It not only encourages positive behavior in teens but also keeps them safe from potential harm. 
Having a curfew is a great way to benefit teenagers. Furthermore, it greatly reduces the chances of teens being involved in a crime or violence during late hours. 

When it comes to the workplace and public, having a curfew allows for a better attitude and behavior among teens. By having a curfew, teens are encouraged to select activities that are within the restriction of the time, thus, allowing for healthy habits to be formed. With a curfew, teens receive ample time to finish their school work, participate in extracurricular activities, and contribute to any chores assigned by their parents. Without this sense of restriction, teenagers may become more vulnerable to getting into dangerous situations due to peer pressure",1
"The effort and energy we put in comes at a cost, but we learn valuable lessons along the way which can later be applied in our personal and professional lives. If we stop whenever things become inconvenient, our potential will never be reached. We must be willing to take risks and accept that failure is part of the process. Every successful person has faced setbacks, disappointments, and numerous challenges, but they never gave up. We must be willing to put in the effort necessary to reach our goals. They kept going even in the face of adversity. With each victory, we become more confident and optimistic. Not giving up despite challenges is essential to achieving success.. Every situation, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity to learn and grow. With patience and practice, we learn how to find solutions and move past any problem.

In order to reach our fullest potential, it is important to never give up. 
Success is an elusive goal that requires hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to never give up. The belief that we can overcome any obstacle gives us the courage and strength to keep fighting.

Another advantage of not giving up prematurely is that we learn how to face our fears and push through. We must have a resilient mentality and an optimistic outlook in order to ensure success. When we keep pushing forward despite life's obstacles, we learn to appreciate the hard-earned victories that come with success. 

When we persist in spite of challenges, we become stronger and more capable",1
"
Graduating high school early can be a beneficial decision for some students, as it can open up more opportunities to gain experiences and explore alternative career paths.Students can use the extra time to take classes or participate in activities that help them achieve their career goals. Additionally, completing high school early will allow students to take on a heavier workload as they transition to college or other postsecondary education earlier. It can place additional stress and workload on students who are taking on classes before they are fully prepared, and the transition to college without the full scope of a high school education can cause difficulty in adapting to the new environment. 

However, graduating high school early does come with its own set of risks. Additionally, students may miss out on certain activities or experiences that could help them in the long run.",1
"in the actuality the people act like robots. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on people's lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the technology expose our private life. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. Albert Einsteins said "" I am afraid that one day the technology outdo the human brain."" He was afraid that one day the technology controls humanity. The technology is opaquing our intellect. . to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. I am going to expose my family and friends",0
"The actions as words are powerful over another's person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are.

I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. In my opinion people's actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others.

Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. People follow others because they like the other person's personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media.

Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow.

I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone else's life there is nothing better than our own behavior. It is like when someone ask a child, "" what do you want to be when you become an adult"". Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on.            . We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give",0
"Naturalization can provide opportunities for citizens from other countries to find better employment, earn more money, and gain access to the voting booth, allowing them to affect change in their new nation.

However, naturalization can also contribute to instability in the societies of newly naturalized citizens as they adjust to new cultures and laws. One issue that has been linked to naturalization is the sale and purchase of guns on the street. Studies have shown that gun activity tends to increase in
communities with high naturalization rates, especially among young adults. This suggests that gun laws might need to be more strictly enforced or modified as immigrants become naturalized citizens.

Overall, it is clear that the political implications of naturalization can be complex and far reaching. 
The political implications of naturalization of citizens from foreign countries are complex. Naturalization provides numerous opportunities for citizens from other countries but also brings with it a number of potential challenges. We must study the issue of gun control in relation to naturalization and consider how laws and policies might need to be adjusted in order to ensure that naturalization not only benefits the newly naturalized citizens, but also their new communities.. John Lubbock's writings explain that naturalization can present economic, voting, and language issues for citizens that immigrate from other countries",1
"Establishing group rules and mutually agreed-upon goals can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are being made efficiently. As demonstrated, group work can be much more beneficial than working alone and should be the preferred method for completing projects or tasks.. Plus, we are able to keep up with the progress of our peers, which adds a layer of accountability to each member of the group.

Despite the advantages of group work, some may argue that it can lead to wasted time and disagreements between peers. 
Working in a group can be incredibly beneficial compared to working alone. 

Furthermore, collaborating with peers on a project or task helps us stay organized and on task. Additionally, setting due dates and holding each member of the team accountable to their individual tasks will help minimize conflicts and wasted time.

To sum up, working in a group comes with numerous benefits that can enhance the process and quality of completing an assignment. Group work allows us to gain knowledge from our peers, encouraging us to think outside of the box and come up with unique and creative solutions. Together, we were able to create a highly effective solution that drew from each of our strengths, whereas if I was working alone, the quality of the results would have likely suffered. We are more motivated to stay focused and complete the assignment in a timely manner than if we were working independently since we don't want to let our group members down. With proper planning and communication, disagreements and wasted time can be minimized, allowing groups to maximize their effectiveness. For example, when I was working on a group project in college, I had the benefit of working alongside three other students who each had their own area of expertise. Yet, with proper planning and communication, these issues can be minimized",1
"I have an example of my own sister: In first, she joined in the medical line because my parents wants her to be a doctor and after she read some of the courses of the medicine,she realize that her interest is not to become a doctor and then she left her courses and start another courses. The problem is not that they don't get opportunity to choose their jobs,the problem is that they don't understand where is their destination. For example: I had a one friend whose name is Generic_Name, she choose to be a doctor in first, but then she realize that she never had any interest in doctor. If we have interest in something, we defiantly work hard to get that goal. It helps me to understand about the characteristic of the different works, and also helps me to recognize my interest for my career. If I understand my journey, then I expect that I will success to get my destination. So, if you select me to visit and learn about the works, it will helps me to understand about the interest that I have for my future.

The most important things in students life is to choose their own interest, to make their future happy and peaceful ,but they really don't understand where will they go because of the pressure in their mind. That's why, I don't want to be confuse in my life. So, I humbly request you that please select me to visit and learn about the work that I have interest to do.

Time is very important for everyone. Career is directly related to the employment. Although they have different aim or interest, they join in the work that their parents wants because they don't understand the value of their interest.

So, if the school or any companies allow students to explore or visit about the works, they better understand the value of their interests and never join in any other works that they don't want to be. Everyone wants to do the best in their life. And also, if you select me I will aware other people about the interest or works and also help them to choose their interest. After that, she left her job and become a photographer because photographic is her real interest not to be a doctor. Nobody wants to waste their time because they believe that time is money. I want to be clear about my future.

All the people in this world are different, they have different aim in their life. So,why students waste their time to choose the way that they don't want to go. The main reason to go school is to make our career. Employment is not the biggest thing,but the interest is the biggest things. Schools makes you capable to choose your own way. Everyone has rights to select their own jobs. In this 21st century,all the parents wants their children to be a doctor or an engineer or in the other biggest post but not all the children have same interest as their parents have. Employment is the thing that helps you to do best in your life and also helps us to understand who we are and how important we are. So, I want to be selected to visit and learn about the work. For example: If you left your dog in a street that he never walked,

then how can you expect that he accomplished his destination? Same happened to the students life, if someone who is well-experienced didn't tell them about the journey of life or how to choose their interest,how can we except that they will become a successful person.

Lastly, I want to say that if you select me to visit and learn about the work ,then I get opportunity to learn about my interest which helps me to get a better future",0
"If they have a brother, or sister that they have to take care of or they have to work two jobs to help there parents out. or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there where is two teachers.

I feel like my school they should let students graduate with a low GPA because there is some students that have a hard time keeping up there grades up like. also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years.

If there bad grades are low or GPA they can take a another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. I feel like if students want to graduate in three years or two years they should talk to someone like there teachers and they can ask them if there GPA is low.

there is a lot of ways that they can help them for an example if they are failing any classes then they can take some classes online, or if they can go to night school,or stay after school for more help. There is a another way for them they can go to school summer and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they don't want to keep on going to school. what i like about my school is that they let students pass there sol's with a 375 or more the ones that are in small group and that they need more help. but i feel like students shouldn't work while going to school because that how they get bad grades and can't bring up any grades up.

"Online books are easy to carry because it's on their smart phones. . No more looking for your book when you lost it. When you go on a road trip and nothing to do, you can read on your smart phone or any devices. People should get used to all the technology right now because sooner or later it will become bigger. Other people can also edit or help you on it. One topic that is frequently debated is technology is a positive or negative effects on people's lives.  . In schools, they sometimes provide tablets and laptop for students because they want them to learn better and makes sure they have something to do their work on. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework. Some people like to show when they get something new, but they have to take care of when they get it because technology are expensive. Also on video chat you can call up to how many people and all the time you want. Email is one of the way to send a rough draft or a final draft. You can't write a letter and wait for 5-7 days or probably more for a responds. Parents don't get a lot of time to relax and read a book, but on road trip they can while their children are sleeping in the back. Everyone thinks technology is bad cause of the things they see on the news.

Not everyone has time to go to the bookstore and find the book there trying to look for. Just think about it in the future more technology will come and no more paper and pencil because everything will be on technology.

Most people like that technology is growing because it's better. Also they can watch videos how to do something or explain it better.

Technology is a good way to communicate with or without speaking. All books are online now and makes it an easier and faster. Technology is a positive effect because mostly everything is online. There's many ways to get to everything with no issues or problems. I think technology will be a big part of people's live soon. Right now everything is at a start point, everyone thinks it's fun to have a tablet, laptop, smart phone, or headphones. Everyone will miss paper and pencil, but its a safe and better way to get through everyone. I believe that technology is good because books are online, get talk to other people through a laptop or a smart phone, and can write it on a notepad or word document. Also it's a good way to communicate with other people faster. Plus online books doesn't loose your spot, gives you an option to put a bookmark on the page you want to save, and if you don't know a word it will give you the definition and translate in another language.

Some people lives in another country or states and it's hard to communicate over a letter or phone call. Even kids have tablets for learning their ABC's and 123's. People complain how they can't meet up because they already have plans for other things, but they can just set up a time and day and they can do from everywhere they are at.

Technology is going to upgrade is the near future. Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat",0
"Moreover, by taking on tasks and projects that require you to push yourself, you can also gain respect from your peers. Feeling satisfied in what you have accomplished is an important part of living a fulfilling life and having a healthy mind. By pushing yourself and taking on different tasks, not only can you gain tangible experience, but also have a more fulfilling and enjoyable life.. By trying something that you don't think you can do, you can gain a better understanding of yourself and what you are capable of achieving. 
In life, it's important to challenge yourself and push the boundaries of what you can achieve. By consistently pushing your boundaries and trying something new, your sense of self-esteem and self-confidence will grow as you gain more experience and success in overcoming challenges. For example, have you ever encountered a problem that seemed impossible to solve? By stepping back and looking at it in a different way, you might find that you can come up with a creative solution to the problem that you would never have thought of before.

In addition to providing creative solutions, challenging yourself can also help with personal growth. 

Finally, taking on challenges can also give you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Knowing that you have conquered something that seemed impossible can also give you a strong sense of pride in yourself. By pushing yourself to accomplish goals that seem impossible or difficult, you can often find solutions that weren't apparent before you decided to take on the challenge. 

Overall, challenging yourself is an essential part of personal growth and can help you become more confident, creative, and satisfied",1
"A good first impression could also help to create a lasting impression that could benefit us in the future.

In addition to helping in professional contexts, making a good first impression will also have a great impact on our personal lives. 
Making a good first impression is incredibly important in many aspects of life. For instance, in any job interview you will have one shot to make your first impression count and if successful can lead to a great job opportunity",1
"This system would allow students to use points to purchase their favorite snacks, while also incentivizing them to select healthier options with more points. 
One possible way schools can balance school meals is by implementing a points system. It is important to take into consideration all the pros and cons of this option, as well as the impact it could have on students' physical, overall, and academic health.. 

Overall, a points system could be a viable way to provide healthy food options in schools while still allowing students to enjoy their favorite snacks. By putting foods into assigned categories and setting different point values for each, schools could help guide students to make healthier choices while also allowing students freedom to choose.

The biggest advantage of a points system is that it would create student-specific meal plans, taking into account each student's dietary needs and preferences. 
It is also important to note that the effectiveness of the points system can vary among different students and depending on the school. Furthermore, with rising food prices, it may be difficult for students from lower-income households to afford the more expensive, healthier snacks. It could also potentially reduce the amount of food waste in school since students would only be purchasing items they actually want to eat. Additionally, it would encourage healthier snacking while also allowing for the occasional treat.

However, it is important to consider the drawbacks of a points system as well. By incentivizing healthy choices, there is a risk that students will be more likely to go for the healthier options simply because they get more points",1
"The adage “no pain, no gain” rings true here, as hard work and dedication tend to be the ideal ingredients for setting oneself apart from the competition. While it is tempting to indulge in inactivity and be content with minimal effort, it is important to recognize that a lack of productivity is a danger to personal fulfillment and advancement. Thomas Jefferson once said, “Diligence is the mother of good luck” — a sentiment that speaks to the power and rewards of perseverance. By investing in ourselves through hard work and commitment, we proudly set ourselves up for success.. 
Developing good habits and having a positive work ethic can lead to unparalleled success",1
"For example, I'm a very shy person, it's rare the times I talk in class but when I'm in a group I have to talk, share my thoughts with my group members and communicate with them.

Reasons why I prefer working alone are: I focus more doing my own work, it's only my responsibility not others, I have to worry to turn it in on time, if i get a bad grade it's going to be my fault not others, I'm responsible for my own actions, I have to make sure if everything is right to get all the credit.

Reasons why I don't like to work in groups are: sometimes they're not responsible for doing their part, if they do their work they do it all messy( you can't even understand their hand writing), they play around too much because sometimes they take it as free time, they spend most of the time on their phone instead of doing what they are supposed to do, sometimes they don't do their part in time and we have to turn it in late and don't get all the credit.

I believe working in groups is beneficial but at the same time it's not, I think it depends with the people you work with, because if you work with people that do their work and actually care about school they will definitely be beneficial and make your group work out. What are the benefits of working with a group and working alone? I believe that working in groups helps you to have more ideas, more knowledge, because if you communicate with your group members, they'll think about different ideas to proceed the work that is getting done. Working alone sometimes helps you more than working with groups because you are responsible for your own work.

I rather work by myself because I've had bad experience working with groups. However, I think working in groups is important because you can come out of your comfort zone and be free to share your thoughts with your group members, and you can make friends too. If you work with someone who doesn't care and is always playing around, you won't get anything done and will receive a bad grade unless you do all the work and the other person will just get credit by not doing anything, in that case there is no point to work in groups.

In conclusion, I believe it's more beneficial to work alone than groups because you can focus more on what you're doing and take responsibility of your own work, because if you don't take care of your school work nobody is going to do it for you. When I work in groups sometimes I'm the one that has to do all the work, and in my opinion if we are working in groups we have to help each other, communicate and share our thoughts because if we don't do that what's the point of working in groups. So you have to chose what's better for you and what's going to benefit you more, but for me I feel like working alone is more beneficial for me than working in groups.                  ",0

"Which means we would probably have a little longer school year.

If we did have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, the school year would be pretty short and the students wouldn't like the short breaks. Since It snows a lot in the winter we would be missing more days of school If winter break was longer. Since it snows a lot in the winter, we miss a lot of school days. We just had a 2 month summer break which gave the students the opportunity to be ready for the next school year and also gave them a chance to have a vacation. Students would be missing lessons, quizes, and even tests because of the snow days we get. Since there is also a lot of holidays in the school year, a fall break would interfere with the day we get out of school. We shouldn't have a break in the fall if we just got back into school after the long summer break.

We should not have a longer winter break. Students need to catch up on everything and finish lessons before the school year ends. In the summer students also get the chance to visit family members, spend more time with their family, and even get ready for the next school year.

Since we just got back into school, It is not necessary to have a one week break in the fall. Even though the educators would like it and thinks that it is helpful for students, it would make the students feel stressed out since the school year would probably be shorter.

Having regular summer break, regular winter break, and regular spring break, would be a better idea then having a shorter summer break, long winter break, and a break for spring and fall.. The school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get, which is 2 months. Having a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall does not sound like a good Idea to me. Students deserve the 2 months of summer break because of all the hard work and studying they did in the school year. If we get a longer winter break we would be getting out of school later on which means less summer vacation.

Since the school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get",0

"People should make their decisions because first everyone should depends on himself in life to get more experience second people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions third making decisions make people stronger and know what to do in a hard situation.

One Decision Can Change A Person Life!

However, some people might argue with that, because they think that people should not make their own decisions but they should seek guidance from experts to make a better decisions for them.

First, everyone should depends on himself and make a better decisions in life to get more experience for example a student can't get a good grade unless he makes a decisions to pay attention to the teacher and doing the homework.

Second, people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions for example nobody will be by your side all the time and in the hard situations to help you make a good decision and a person should not just think once but twice and think far and know what are the consequences of every decision.

Third, one decision can change everybody life and that is on of the reasons why people should depend on them self because nobody cares about you more than you. Other reason is most of the successful people they started from nothing but they made a good decisions and they became successful.

In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because first everyone should depends on himself in life to get more experience second people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions third making decisions make people stronger and know what to do in a hard situation.

people have to do ideas with own life because in the future when they have own family and they have experience from they parent. I agree with this because some people have alot problem and they life people and they can not make good ideas and good decision i hunderstand that because when we have problem and life is dificul to make good decision and make idaes some student have good decision and they make alot thing for they can help and they life because they think they want good future for they life and they want to make good ideas for they life because they want parent happy about good decision they have and they life because that ideas they have is more different of other student have good ides.       .

"In addition, technology is creating a world of instant gratification, which can lead to feelings of impatience with the non-digital world and can lead to a decrease in motivation and self-regulation.

Overall, technology has both positive and negative effects on our lives. It enables us to work more efficiently and communicate more easily; however, it can also lead to unhealthy habits and an overall decrease in motivation. In addition, even mundane tasks such as online banking, grocery shopping, and paying bills can be done quickly and efficiently without ever having to leave the house.

Unfortunately, technology also has its downsides. Therefore, it is important to keep a balance between the two, in order to have a healthy and productive lifestyle.. 
Technology has changed the way we live our lives. For example, it can lead to an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, as people often spend large amounts of time on the computer, instead of going outdoors and exercising. In the past, the way to find out information about someone or something was to do research; however today, we can find out almost anything we want to know quickly and even communicate with people regardless of distance. From simple labor-reducing items such as washing machines and computers, to revolutionary communication tools like the Internet and smart phones, technology advances have altered the way we experience the world.

One of the most positive impacts of technology is the fact that it facilitates easier and faster communication between people. Also, spending too much time on digital devices can result in damage to relationships due to less face-to-face time with family and friends",1
"Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule.         . Many students work on afternoon. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses.

To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately.

Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. A person can simply use the google to find a class. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time.

To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules.

Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind",0
"You can apply to many collleges online and that is really great so you can get accepted to many colleges out in other countries or states. Also when you have test it's mostly technology because you don't really have test on paper anymore now it's on laptops and you don't have to write anything now it's only typed it is really easy and fast. Technology has positive effects on people's lives because they can help you with many information that your trying to look up for example if your trying to shop, play games, or even buy or read books. When my brother was in 12th grade he wanted to go personaly to the colleges but he said some of them were too far and that he didnt want to go because he needed to do something really important and so what he did was that he went online and started applying for 5 colleges and he got accepted to 4 of them. Even essays it used to be essays on paper and now it's essays in laptops.

In conclusion, These were my 3 main reasons why technology has a positive effect on people's lives. Here are my 3 reasons why technology is positive for people's lives.

First, let's say that you want to go to college but you can't go to the college because you don't have time or maybe that you just can't go. When you ask your teachers what they would say is that go on your laptop and look it up and then go ask your classmates if you can't find anything. What you can do is that you can go on your laptop and go to the website and apply there and you can take your time on it and not have to worry about going there. I don't like seeing people with bad attitude it makes me mad and it always makes me just go away and not look at them anymore.

Third, In school sometimes you have projects and you have class work but you can't find information about your research or anything about your topic or about your class work then you have to find information online. For my US VA History project are teachers gave us many different websites that we can use and they were very helpful I got all my information from there. That's why people prefer that it's better to go to the store and just buy it from there. ""It's better technology instead of talking to people"".. The process of returing it and everythig is just too much. They help you do a lot when you really need it. He said it was not even hard. At the same time even tho your not going out if you shop online there is a posibility that your clothes that you ordered does not fit you or it might not come on time when you really need it. I didn't even have to go ask him for help or anything. When you go to the stores sometimes you have to handle some workers that are aggressive and they have a bad attitude. If that was me I would prefer to go to the mall or the store to. There can be many positive effects on technology but theses 3 were mostly about how technology is even tho you do not interact with other humans face-to-face it is good doing online things. Having to fill papers with people takes up so much time that you will be there the whole day instead of you doing it online at home and not having to rush up anything and if you mess up the laptop tells you that there is something that you typed up is wrong.

Second, If you don't feel like going to the store because your just tired and you just don't want to go out but you need some clothes for that night and you don't have any then what you can do is go online and start shopping there and buy everything you need for that night and you will be fine with out the need of going to the mall or going to any other store. If I were to ask many people which side they prefer they would choose the positive effect side. Technology is not for only buying or doing any other things it's for doing projects in class or a if your doing your homework, applying for jobs, and applying for college. There are better chances that you get many things done and also you get the chance to have some time off of looking and talking to people",0

I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the they want you to be.

I start with my family; How i said my family they don't like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the I don't want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the they don't like to much, they don't like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment.

In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; The happen to me alot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the you have, so you have to be like the company want you to be and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else.

That's why I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who don't belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often.",0
"You are not going to success on something right away when you know is the first time you are doing it ,

you have to take steps by steps to do it. maybe you might lost people during that battle but when you know the meaning of the quote and you understand it you are going to know that everything was for a purpose in life and after all you when through you success a lot in your life. Success is the desire of outcome in many goals in life, is the gaining of wealth and fame,

Success is to attain desire of doing what you like even know you are going to have to fail on it many times doing in it.

Success consists of going from failure to failure because nothing is perfect in life. is the quote you have to keep on mind when you fail the first time and the the second time you got it right. thats where you are going to known the meaning of the quote. there are so many things that are going to be wrong, they are going to be times that you are going to fail on what you are doing. And your enthusiasm is going to come down and down each day for everything that people tell you. Ia the quote that you have too keep on mind when people tells you that you cant do anything because you fail it your first time.    . but you have to always keep your enthusiasm up.

Because enthusiasm consists in strong and a warm feeling that tells you that you re always have to keep strong and keep your head up in what you are doing.

""success consists of going from a failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""is one of the Quotes you always have to keep on mind when you are doing something the first time. i strongly agree when the Former British Minister Winston Churchill say how failure takes a extremely important position in success. and you are going to see that all hard work you have done it was for a purpose to success more in life. You are going to start thinking i can't do this because i have done it many times and i always fail on it or i can't do this because my friend's and family members say i can't do it because when i do it i always comes up wrong.

Failure consists in falling to do something,it consists in the inability to do something or perform To success you are always going to fail and fail and fail till you get it right. To success you have to fail many times as you need to the same thing so you can get it right and success on in. During life you are always going to have ups and downs everyday, you are going to lose people because you might be doing something that they don't like or maybe You might be facing some obstacles that stops you from success and doing what you like. you are going to face many difficulties doing what you like or the choices that you make but in the end there is going to be a purpose for what you are doing. there are going to be times where people are going to try to put you down and tell you that you can't do it just because its your first time trying it and you fail it in your first time. During success you are going to lose your enthusiasm in what you are trying to success in",0
"Someone can tell you bad news, like someone dying, you can't be positive during someones death, especially if its someone close to you. Having a positive attitude all the time is not the key to life. If it was then why do so many people have to get hurt in our day and age. Something can always happen in any moment at anytime in you're life. People are going to be positive after they've broken up with someone they been with for so long. Being that you could have a happy life is possible but you will always come across obsticles that you can't just be positive about and not caring for. In cunclusion, having a positive attitude is not the key to life because you will always have a gloomy day and there won't be an escape then.. Imagine a heart break, loving someone for so long but them leaving you just cause they didn't want to date you anymore. Having a positive attitude all the time would only make things worse cause you don't always have the best days. It has been said that positive attitude is the key to life but other people think otherwise. Would't you be misserable if you had a positive attitude all the time, always looking happy and never looking down. That's when everything crashes down on you and falls on your lap. Due to the lack of happiness people get depressed, sad and lonley. That's why Being positive isn't they key to life, if it was the key to life then why do so many bad people live on this earth, and want to do bad thing to others just living the're lives",0
"When people see things they do not like then they most likely will not eat it or even try it out.

Lastly, changing the cafeteria food would leave students with less options to choose from. Changing the cafeteria food for students would be like taking a bone away from a dog. One of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. It would be unfair for those who dont like what they are serving and they would have nothing else to eat. For example, when I went to a family dinner they made meat loaf and I absolutely hated it, I couldnt bring myself to finish it and I felt extremely bad but i had to throw it away. One day I was watching a show and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent and it turned into a big thing.  . Another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and I went to a buffet and they didnt have a lot options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings and it was just awful we could not eat it all. Thats what students would feel if the school lunch were to change.

Some people say that changing to a healthier school lunch would be a lot better for students; Although, this is a good point, its wrong because it misses the fact that some students would be unhappy with this decision. These are some reasons on why changing the menu would be a bad idea for the school. Students were so angry the went on a ""strike"" and refused to go to school.

Another reason why taking away students favorite food would be a bad idea is because students would stop eating at school. When students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. You would be very unsatisfied if that wouldve happen to you. Look at it like this, its like when you go out to your favorite shopping store and they have taken out all the clothes you loved so much about that store and they replaced it with clothes you hate",0
"My skill is can speak Vietnamese fluently. People are love challenges and learn new languages. I can do a lot of things with Vietnamese, such as translate English to Vietnamese, teach my friends how to speak Vietnamese and to communicate with others Vietnamese.

I can speak both Vietnamese and English at the same time, so that's mean I could translate from English to Vietnamese or even Vietnamese to English. Vietnamese is on top 10 hardest language has spoken. I remember that one time, I had a family reunion and I went to Vietnam. It would help you a lot if you want to visit Vietnam one day.. That is my main job whenever I go out with my mom, because she doesn't speak English or able to understand it.

My friends are love Vietnamese, they always convince me to teach them this amazing language. There are 67 languages have spoken in the world, 8.9% of us speak Vietnamese. Then I was lost, I tried yell ""Help me, I lost, I can't find my parent"", but they couldn't understand what I was said, luckily I can speak Vietnamese, I asked them where is the police station so I could find my parents.

Overall, Vietnamese is the perfect language to learn if you want to challenge yourself. Don't you think it would be helpful for your parents when you 're on a family vacation. When I come to my class my friend start saying ""Xin Chao"" it means ""Hello"" in English, I'm so glad that they love and want to learn it. I had a friend who is American, I taught him how to speak Vietnamese, and now he can speak Vietnamese like his home language.

However it would be helpful if you are in Vietnam or a place where the most Vietnamese people lives, you could ask them in Vietnamese when you need help( I bet if you are from a foreign country and you can speak Vietnamese, they will think you're super cool)",0
"I agree with being honest because holding the truth for so long can hurt a persons feeling wether you know them for long. Later on your life lying would make you regret what you did and why you did it because you'll lose someone in your life as well as the person you love.

Being honest with you family and friends would be the best choice because later on your life you dont have worry about any regrets on your actions on what you did. . Being honest is a good choice because it is over to get easily without lying and worrying about it later on about it and what you did. Lying about something you did do could get you to make the person believe that they aren't your friend or aren't special to you but telling to truth means that they can also tell honesty and how loyal you are.

Lying would make it hard for you in your life (future) and the people who care a lot for you because they wouldn't trust you ever again or talk to you. It'll make it harder for you to communicate with them when you see them or try to talk",0
"However, there are also some key differences between them. Additionally, by mandating health insurance, more people would be able to access the healthcare they need.

On the other hand, Policy 2 is beneficial in terms of reducing the cost of healthcare services. By providing incentives to doctors, more people would be able to receive medical treatment and would be able to find a doctor more quickly. Policy 1 focuses on providing access to quality healthcare by mandating that all citizens have health insurance, while Policy 2 focuses on providing incentives to doctors to increase the number of people they treat.

In my opinion, Policy 1 is more beneficial in terms of reducing healthcare costs and increasing access to medical services. By requiring all citizens to purchase health insurance, the cost of healthcare can be spread out and made more affordable. By providing incentives to doctors and requiring all citizens to purchase health insurance, both policies can work together to make healthcare more accessible and more affordable.. 
Policy 1 and Policy 2 have many similarities, such as both focusing on improving the healthcare system. This would help reduce wait times and reduce the amount of money spent on medical costs.

Overall, I think both policies have their merits and can be used in tandem to improve the healthcare system",1
"Ultimately, then, it's evident from the life and work of Albert Einstein that imagination is indeed more important than knowledge.. 
Albert Einstein famously said, “imagination is more important than knowledge.” This statement is certainly true in the case of Einstein himself. Additionally, Einstein's ideas were not limited to scientific discoveries; his humanistic views and philosophies on life were also formed and expressed through his imaginative powers. He was able to draw connections between different lines of thought and concepts that had been previously considered unrelated or incongruous, a feat enabled by his strong and creative imagination. However, these inventions and accomplishments weren’t the result of mere knowledge or memorized facts. Instead, Einstein relied on his imagination and ability to think outside the box. He is well known for his groundbreaking discoveries and inventions, from developing the theory of relativity to his Nobel Prize winning work on the photoelectric effect",1
"I will die having a class like that but. I hope we have gym for 2 hour and 30 minutes everyday that will be fun but without having health and I will be so happy if we never have 5 sol every year like 2 or 3 is fine but 5 no that's to much sols for 1 year like the county is so mean to us but it's all good and having recess like what I had when I was a little boy.

I think when i get older I want to be a soccer player or a basketball player but I do not know yet like when my dad was a little boy he was poor and he want to be a soccer player but his dream never became true but when he came to the united states he went to her don high school for 2 or 3 year and than he learned how to speck engli8sh and got to play for the schools soccer team.

I think school is not that hard but for some people it is but the hardest class for me is Math and

History that all the class that I hard for me the other class are not that hard for me.......... Because students will have to wake up very early everyday and get out from school late that's messed up to do to us like every class will be like more than a 1 hour and 30 minutes of class time hell no. I disagree with the school bored adding one and a half hour to school each day. ",0
"This is a rare chance for me and i have plenty of time during the summer brake.. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. Because i really like and also thirst for be a nurse and i think nurse can help a lot of people.

First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save people's life. What a mighty job it is!

In conclusion, i hope i can get this opportunity, this hospital have high opinion in VA, and there's more projects that can makes me learn. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, i'm fascinated. I'm very interested in the nurse and now there's an opportunity that school tell us to strive for an internship in this hospital, i'm very glad to attend this competition. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and there's blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" I'm so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know i'm the hope for him"". There's some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i can't learn from the book.

Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. Actually i know, it's a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder",0
"Having a positive mindset encourages young children to treat everyone with respect. They can also brighten someones day by giving them a compliment or just as little as smiling at someone.

Also if you have a positive attitude you can accomplish your goals. Your parents would be so proud. Therefore if you have a positive mindset not only can you achieve and accomplish your goals. Why should students have a good attitude even when they're not in the mood? I think that students should have a positive attitude because.              . And children could learn from the elderly and mimick their actions and words.

In conclusion i believe that everyone should treat everyone with respect and have a good attitude towards one another because were all one. Regardless of race and religion. You can be proud of who you have become and your hard work. Once youv'e done everything you dreamt of achieving. it might make them forget why they were even upset in the first place",0
"

Both students can benefit from the social aspect of partnering together. Not only does it give younger students a chance to learn from more experienced peers, but it also allows older students to gain experience in leadership. The older student can hone their leadership skills by encouraging the younger student to do their best and stay engaged. 

Overall, pairing older and younger students together can result in many positive outcomes, both academically and socially. 
Pairing older and younger students together can have a plethora of educational benefits for both parties. For example, older students can teach younger students essential academic skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking, while younger students can help the older students stay up-to-date on the latest trends in technology and social media. The combined knowledge and experience from both sets of students can develop an environment of learning and exploration that can be immensely beneficial to both parties.. The younger student can gain a role model to emulate and a strong, positive influence from the older student. In addition to these academic and social benefits, the students can enhance their emotional intelligence by learning to express and accept emotions in healthy ways",1
"In video conferencing, the instructor might not be able to physically demonstrate something, which can make it harder to understand the topic.

In conclusion, online and video conferencing classes offer a unique set of benefits and drawbacks. Another potential disadvantage is difficulty understanding complex topics. Ultimately, the advantages and disadvantages should be weighed carefully in order to choose the best learning method for an individual student.. 
Taking online or watching video conferencing classes has a number of pros and cons that must be considered. One of the greatest advantages of online and video conferencing classes is convenience; students can access and participate from anywhere, anytime on their own schedule. It can be harder to stay focused and engaged in an online or video conferencing environment due to a lack of physical presence and interaction with peers and instructors. Additionally, with video conferencing, students can better understand facial expressions and body language that they might miss in an online course.

A potential downside to both online and video conferencing classes is the lack of student engagement",1
"If you try to help a friend by talking to the person that made your friend feel upset you could feel a friends mom or some adult you know close to your family.

When you made a poor choice it could get you in a lot of trouble when you are hanging around with friends and they want to do something thats not a good choice you could talk to them and tell them that is not going to be a good idea. Do you image a Middle School student being in you classroom and telling you what you shouldnt do so you dont get introble I you future at school. You dont want to get in school suspended that would just get you in a room with a teacher and you are not going to be able to talk to anyone. If I were you and I knew that some one wants to get into a fight I would ell the teacher and let them handle it not you. Have you ever though what you can do to stay out of trouble in school? You might always have that one friend that gets introble a lot right? Ways you can prevent that from being you is try to prevent from getting into a fights that would just make it a bad idea, if you know someone that is doing what they are not so post to tell a teacher, dont make a poor choice and you get introble because you decided that you were going to do something that your friends wanted you to do.

When you get into a fight in school the only thing that that will do to you is get you into in school suspension or you would get suspended from school for a while. Another thing that if you do while there is a fight at your school and you record it you could get in trouble by that as well.

If you know something is wrong with a friend and they need help from an adult I would tell a teacher at school that can help them or there parents if you know them. A lot of times when kids make a poor choice they would have to face the consequences and they may not like them but they should of thought the things two times before they made there design.

There are so many different ways that you can stay our of trouble but theses three are the most common ones that i know of try not to get into a fight, help out your friends or tell an adult if they need help from some one, and dont make poor choices.",0
"A traditional school setting may benefit a student who needs structure and the support system that is available in school. 

When considering which setting is better for students, it depends on the individual needs of the student. 
Learning in a traditional school setting and online school have some distinct differences. Therefore, it is important to consider the individual learning needs of the student when selecting the best school setting.. An online school may be more suitable for a student who is intrinsically motivated and can work independently. In an online school setting, students are more independent in their learning, as they can access the courses asynchronously form any location. In a traditional school students can interact with their peers and teachers face to face, and have access to supplementary educational support such as the library or extra-curricular activities",1

"They say that is better working with more people because when you work alone you get bored or you don't get motivated as the people that works in groups. Every person have their own way to work but if you work alone you are not allowed to get in issues, arguments, problems and bad grades. Working in a group is better because people can share their ideas with the other people in the group and they can do a very good work using all those ideas. First, it is a little bit boring because they don't have nobody to talk and to share their ideas but they know what they are going to work with. Third, people can edit their work many times without asking other people what they think about it. Second, they do not have to wait for people to tell them what to do or to ask if the work that they did is correct.  . Also, the work can be divided in equal parts, and that's fair, in that way everybody have the same amount of work to do.

Some people think otherwise, they prefer working alone for many reasons. People is different, they have different believes and ways to work.

Some people prefer working in a group for many reasons. Other people think otherwise, they say that working alone is more beneficial than working in a group. One of that reasons is that people in a group get more things done in less time. That means that if somebody made a mistake every group member will be affected because of that.

In conclusion, working alone is more beneficial because of a lot of reasons. Another reason is that people does not have other people rushing them. And sometimes people that work in groups have a lot of issues because they do not agree with other people work, and a lot of times the grade that they got for that work is the same for every group member. They can do their work in their own way, they can take all the time they want to do the work. Most people believe that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone",0
"Without the rush to complete high school earlier, students are able to take a break and rest between the hectic school year, allowing them to take advantage of leisurely summer activities while still having ample time to study and prepare for college when necessary. This can lead to feeling behind as compared to peers who are farther along in their field of study or career. 

In addition to the academic benefits of completing the standard four years of high school, students also gain the advantage of more time to rest and relax during the summer. 

Of course, there are also some disadvantages of taking the traditional four years in high school. 
Taking the traditional four years to complete high school can offer students a variety of benefits. 

Though there may be a few disadvantages of completing the standard four years in high school, there are numerous benefits that can help students succeed in their future academic and professional pursuits.. Additionally, if a student is eager to move away for college it can be difficult to wait an extra year or two before finally packing their bags. Spending more time in high school can be seen as a delay in students starting their college and career ambitions. Furthermore, the extra time helps prepare students for the future by giving them additional time to take college preparatory classes, as well as participate in extracurricular activities and internships. Completing extra time in high school allows students to gain valuable academic knowledge that will help them be successful during college",1
"People should instead strive to make decisions that best reflect their own individual goals and values. It is important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to most decisions and that what works for one person is not necessarily the best option for another.

When making decisions, it is important to ensure that the choices being made ultimately reflect our individual values and desires. This is an important life skill that can lead to increased confidence, as well as greater autonomy and satisfaction in the choices being made.. 
In life, it is important to make decisions that will best benefit yourself and your future. People should be encouraged to question the advice they receive and weigh the potential outcomes of their decisions before deciding which action to take. Seeking the advice of others, including experts, can be beneficial, but personal autonomy should be the primary factor in decision-making. Too often, people rely on the advice of experts to make decisions that may be in their best interests. This is an important exercise in self-awareness which will aid in making informed decisions that best reflect individual values and desires.

In conclusion, relying too heavily on expert advice when making decisions can be a dangerous thing. Too often, people lack the courage to stand up for themselves and make their own decisions. This can lead to feelings of regret down the line and a lack of confidence in one’s ability to make decisions independently.

Making decisions without relying on the advice of experts can be intimidating, but it also represents a chance for personal growth and increases in self-esteem",1
"It doesnt just land in your lap everything you do requires you to work for it and the end result will be that you accomplished everything you worked hard for. I think that is what Thomas Jefferson is trying to say in his motivating quote and it really inspired me and i hope it inspires others as well. People that are very determined achieve so much that it inspires others and makes them feel like they need to do something so they can start achieving want they want in life. When you do that good things come in return and it does serve purpose in you life it always have and always will. It makes you wonder if people are doing the most they can to accomplish something and it also makes you think to yourself if you as your own person are doing whatever is it you can to accomplish your goals in life. There wouldnt be so much negativity and so much hatred if somebody would just make a change.

My over all conclusion about this quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote is that it is important for people to actually do something and work hard and achieve there goal. One reason is because in oder to do something or succeed in something you have to be doing something for that to happen. He set goals and he made them happen he made things happen for our country and all that happend because he was determined and focused and he wanted to do something so he can accomplish what he wanted. For example I feel like a lot of issues in this world could be solved if people would do something people wouldnt be running for there lives because there is a war going on in there country if somebody would do something about it. I feel like some people don't do anything to try to accomplish the set goals they have for themselves and they expect for that goal that they are waiting for to come to them instead of them working for that accomplishment. "" Determine never to be idle... I feel like what message Thomas Jefferson is trying to give is that life is always gonna be hard no matter what but you always have to push yourself and accomplish what needs to be done. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? In my opinion i think we as people accomplish a lot if we are always doing something. I feel like that's very important because if you dont do something to accomplish what you want then nothing is going to happen in your life and I know there are people that don't do anything and they have nothing good going for them.

I feel like Thomas Jefferson was the type of person to stay determined and focused on the goals he wanted to make. It shouldnt be that way but some people think life is like that also when there is a major issue going on in the world some people think that doing nothing is okay. When you put your all into something your hard work pays off and you finally accomplished something and that's all that matters. When people witness a problem some people decide not to do anything and the issue will go away when maybe that's not the case in some situations.

There are people that are dedicated to what they want and will always do something to accomplish or achieve whatever it is they need to achieve and i think that is really good because it just shows that you are determined to do whatever you can to get what you want in life. Everything in life you have to work for it and do something about it. I feel like if people want something to get done you have make a change and stay determined just like what Thomas Jefferson said in his quote and that's very important to keep in mind when you are trying to achieve something and you wanna make a difference.

In Thomas Jefferson's quote he says something that really makes you think about how in society today how people deal with some things.                  ",0

Technology has given elderly people more opportunities to remain healthy and connected with others, while providing a safe space to discuss important topics that may have been difficult to discuss before in person.

"On the other hand, attending classes remotely has its own advantages. 
Attending classes in person vs. One advantage of attending classes in person is that the student can engage in hands-on activities, can build relationships with their peers, and can receive one-on-one help from the teacher. It allows students to listen to videos, slideshows, and tutorials on their own time, can give students more flexibility with their time and schedule, and can save money by eliminating the need to travel to a physical classroom. from home using online/video resources has both advantages and disadvantages. Both of these options have their pros and cons, and it's up to the student to decide which one is best for them.",1
"Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time.

For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things. Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join a other activity espcially if they don't want too.

Overall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress. This is why I say principals shoudn't make students join activies

Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.

Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. Those were all of my reasons on why the principal shouldn't mame students do a other activity ",0

You are able to devote full attention and concentration to your task until it is completed, leading to better quality of work.

"I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing. It is not a good things for us. We can use the less time to do more work.

So that is why I think has the limtation of human contact due to the use of technongy had positive on people's live.. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. We need cost more time. Technology

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. It save many time and improve the work. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us.

People do not need contact work together. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me",0
"However, homeschooling also comes with some disadvantages, including a lack of social interaction, fewer learning opportunities outside of the home, and limited access to subject material and resources. It is important for parents to evaluate the pros and cons of both systems and decide which is best for their child. 

Overall, both traditional and homeschooling can be beneficial to students if designed properly. Proponents of homeschooling point to several advantages over traditional schooling, including a student-centered learning environment, greater flexibility, more personalized academic resources, and lower stress levels. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is clear that homeschooling is a viable option for many families and can have a positive impact on student development.. Studies have found that homeschooling can reduce anxiety as well as disruptive behaviors in students. This is due, in part, to the lack of distractions in the home environment and the ability to learn at a pace that suits each individual. 

Another factor to consider is the effect of homeschooling on student stress. However, there can also be drawbacks to homeschooling, such as feeling isolated or not having access to external support systems. 
Homeschooling has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many parents turning to this option as an alternative to traditional public schooling",1

I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to effect positive change in my community and the greater world. 
Dear [Name of Chief/Officer],

I am writing to express my interest in learning more about careers in the police force. I would be honored to be able to visit your force and experience the work first-hand. I recently completed criminology classes, and am fascinated with the opportunities to put knowledge into action. I believe that the police force plays an important role in protecting and serving the public, and I am eager to learn more about how I might be able to contribute to such an honorable cause.

I look forward to your reply, and I thank you for taking the time to read my letter. 

Sincerely,

". Many people have different thoughts about this questions,

my opinion is depending the sittuation. Making your own decision can make you more independent and know how life works and those are the people we look up too. should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter? one of the common questions i get ask. For example people can learn from there dicision but in other hand listening to people's advice can stop you from doing wrong. Depending on the situation your in listening to others give us life lesson can be one of the most unforgetables momments because that show you they care and want the best for you because maybe they didnt end up making the right decision and want you to prevent from doing it . Ever since i was little i always wanted to make my own decision and wont have to listen to no one but i the more i got older i realized that sometimes what people say to do can turn out to be better then the decision you took",0
"Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. All of this would stink if we wouldn't have such great technology in our hands. org get the piece you need the next day. Is it weird not seeing a employee in the cash register? yes but you'll get use to it as time continues.

Having technology in our side has made us better and has lighten our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! by using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, that's incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative its all online no need of customer service. That's why they invented self checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize.

Who would've known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Just scan and go! sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Isnt technology just great? through time technology has been advancing, and it's just getting better, but is it minimizing our connections with the human contact? I believe its had a good positive effect on peoples lives. How stressful would it be for Ford Junior to hire millions of workers, and finish one car every five hours? or opening up a restaurant and hire twenty workers who are rude, lazy to there customers? and last but certainly not least, Walmart having hundreds of workers who take forever to scan and pack your items. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days?

Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? i have and It was devastating to watch! or have you witnessed a wrong change? things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money.                                         . Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. Yes they'll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. see it this way, technology helps us so much like buildings cars and airplanes, technology has taken over restaurants in such a way that you no longer have to tip! technology and stores do mix and its just speeding up the process.

Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer",0
"Poor attitudes can lead to reduced productivity and bad decisions, negatively impacting the quality of people’s lives and their potential for career success.

After comparing positive and negative attitudes, it is clear that having a positive attitude is the most beneficial choice when it comes to achieving personal and professional goals. 

On the other hand, having a negative attitude can be damaging not only to the attitude holder but to those around them. Appearing positive can open doors to better career options, allowing for professional and personal growth. Therefore, it is important to maintain a positive attitude whenever possible in order to maximize potential opportunities and create more successful outcomes.. It has been shown that people with a positive outlook on their current situation are more likely to explore new possibilities that can lead to rewarding new experiences or opportunities. It can lead to increased motivation to become successful, as well as creating a better impression on those important people that will help further your career. 
Having a positive attitude in life can bring significant benefits, from helping to motivate yourself to helping make a good impression on potential employers and important people",1

For instance, when visiting the waterfalls at night, it is very colorful which makes it beautiful to watch. Also, something I would like to do when I arrive, is to go on a boat ride because it is very peaceful and it make you feel calm as the ride goes along.

In conclusion, a place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City because the people there are well disciplined and nice. And also because there are amazing waterfalls and parks.

To begin with, the people there are well mannered and kind because they treat each other like brothers and sisters instead of mortal enemies.

Working Alone: 
- I prefer to focus on independent work as I can avoid distractions and complete tasks uninterrupted.
- Working alone allows me to make decisions quickly and complete work at my own pace without interruption.
- When I work alone, I can think more clearly and stay organized without needing to answer to anyone else.

"If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I won't give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority.

Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think it's a huge difference when you do because that's peoples main focus in life. I try to stay as focused as possible because once I'm determined and make that my main focus, then It'll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal.

Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that aren't related to what I want or succeed. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesn't mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key.

First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and I'm convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. If I truly believe in myself then I will continue to have a positive energy, but even if

I

don't believe in myself I will remain to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! . Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for.

Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then that's one way i can always succeed",0
"I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they don't try to sneak out again. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. Inconclusion I believe that havig a weekday and weekend curfew is good because it warns kids what there consequnces will be if they disobey the law and going out after curfew hours.. this curfew time is only set only fridays and saturdays. If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place",0
"After completing undergraduate schooling, individuals must go through four years of medical school to earn a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.). 
Becoming a surgeon requires a great deal of dedication and hard work. Once a license has been obtained, individuals can specialize in various areas such as cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, general surgery, and plastic surgery. After completing medical school, individuals must complete, on average, another five to seven years of residency training in a hospital, depending on the specialty, in order to receive a license. Committing a large amount of time to the job is essential for those wishing to pursue a career in surgery.",1
"If the student solely makes the decision on their own, they may feel more in control and the process more authentic. making decisions independently or seeking guidance from experts and authorities can have both advantages and disadvantages. 

Take the example of a college student deciding what degree to pursue. 
Decision-making is an important life skill that has potential implications for someone's future. These should be weighed against each other prior to reaching a decision to ensure that the choice made is the best option for the individual and their future.. Alternatively, seeking external guidance such as advisors, family, or educational programs can give the student an outside perspective and information not available to them individually. Seeking external guidance, particularly from trusted and knowledgeable sources, can help someone become better informed in their decision-making and weigh their options. However, reliance on outside help can also lead to an inability to make decisions independently, which can take away an individual's autonomy in their decision-making. However, depending largely on their own knowledge may lead them to miss out on other potential options or choices that could have been beneficial to their future. Though seeking outside help can potentially lead to the student feeling less autonomy and sense of freedom, this can be beneficial to their future decision-making as they will be more informed and aware of the process. 

Ultimately, making decisions involves both advantages and disadvantages of independent or external guidance that can affect the individual and their future",1
"How can we as a society apply this quote and reduce our collective idleness? By committing ourselves to utilizing every moment to the best of our abilities, we can ensure that our time and energy are being used in an effective and productive way. By actively pushing ourselves to use our time and resources to their fullest potential, we can boost our creativity, experiences, and futures.. 

For instance, one individual who was determined not to be idle was Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard but still managed to create one of the most successful and recognizable technology companies in history. Instead of wasting his time being idle, Gates used his ambition and determination to create something meaningful with his time, and today his success serves as an example for others.

Those who are idle and think that inactivity serves a purpose are not only not determined to better their lives, but they are also not planning for the future. 
""Determine never to be idle"" is a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, and it is a valuable saying that resonates with today’s society, where it often feels like there is not enough time in the day for all we need to do. This means that a lack of passion can lead to stunted intellectual growth and missed opportunities",1
"I like to work at places were i can take to people and i like it to cause when you have other jobs and people barely talk to you it is boring and at hospital you can go to other people's room and can say how was your day and talk with them and tell them how do they feel. I would like to be in the news saying that i saved lots of people's live and that i was making them have much more life and i would like to be a doctor that people would like to go to and i would want everyone to come to me or make a appointment if they are sick and i can cure it any day i want just with a hint of a tool that can help me .I would like to see the organs because lets say you havent seen a organ but you want to see it so bad. I would wash my hand's all the time and make them smell my hands so they can know that i washed them.

thats why always wash your hands.

That's a good choice cause you want to be healthy and always run never stop doing laps outside cause you would not be healthy just by staying inside eating all day . Do you want your family members to be healthy?

The workplace i choose was the Hospital because i see people doing surgery on people and i would love to do it so i can see there organs that i never seen before . They also liked to play with me tag but i always ' said yes and they would be so happy and we only played for a little bit because they would get tired. I would like to vist it so i can se the baby's , mental people , elderly people ,and other people .I would like to take care of the baby's cause i like to take good care of them and i like to go see them each time and they also cry alot but it is really fun . When your parent is sick and you are a doctor you know what to do right away .Sometimes people are so close to get a heart attack but when you are there you save there life alot . some people would like to see other people's organs .thats' why i would like to become a doctor but sometimes some people don't want you to touch them cause sometimes they say you dont wash your hand . I that's why you should always choose to do surgery but sometimes' people faint cause they see the blood alot. That's why i want to work at the hospital to have fun with them take good care of them they would like me alot cause i used to be a person that tooked care of old people and i used to play with alot and made them to color with me .

"DISTANCE LEARNING

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation.

I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit.",0

Prompt-My prompt is explain to people why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice

Seeking muitipule opinions is a better choice beacsue you can get a bunch of diffferent opinions and they most likey will have a better point of view. talk to a friends parent 5. a buisness owner.

I also feel like asking one person would not be the best choice bescause what if they dont have have the best opinions or best advice,i feel like for the bst advice ask more then one person make sure the person is trustable make sure the person knows what they are talking about.

To make sure this trusted person know what they are talking about ask them a few quetions iif they answer them right then they might be a person you can trust

If your the one taking to the kid or adult going having issues have patince with them its probroly a hard topic for them     . talk to a counsler 2. talk to the school social worker 3.

"Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school.  . But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment",0
"I dont think thats good what they doing with the student because there school are not letting then choose there career or what kind of career they want to follow i think is a bad thing what they doing because they not letting the student study what he wants they are choosing what the student can and the career that he is going to follow , i say thatthe student have to say what he wants to be ansd what the they want to study.

From the point the im seeing the situation i dont think in those societies are giving, them a good reason for them to simmit a career,to the student because they are choosing the career for the students and they not letting them to follow a career, that they like because in school they are selecting the classes for the students ,that they are going to follow for only one specific career, and for the age ,that they have i dont think thats a good idea to summit a career because ,you have time to choose what king of career you want to follow and by taking classes for a career that you want and having the time ,and then you think your ready you can summit a career , because what they doing in the school is choosing what the student is going to be went he grows up.

They not letting the student to select there classes that are going to help then in the future for a career , in the school that they going they are selecting the classes ,for the students they not helping them , what they doing is ,that they are giving classes for only one career , and i dont think that they should summit acareer because, they not choosing a career that they want tey are choosing a career, that they giving to them with the classes that they making them have, so student dont have the much career to folow they taking whatever they giving to them.

in conclusion im not agree with what they doing with the student and they still not on the age to summit careers , went they get to the point at school is went you star looking for a career and what you like and what is making you follow the career and i would say ,that if u still in school it dont matter but the school they cant choose what you going to be you have to chose what you going to do and what you like the most and follow your dreams not what others say the you can do do or what you can be you have decide what you going to do the school is to teach you not to chose who you going to be.",0
"Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. Have you thought about your first impression of someone and did it change or not? because our first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at a new school and when you go to an interview for job.

First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. They start realizing that I actually want the job.

In conclusion, first impression are actually possible to change when people are making new friends at school and when you get an interview for job because we need to get to know each other better, instead of letting our first impressions be right. So don't judge a book by it's cover!. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed.

Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that don't have the courage to work by the way you act. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I won't get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didn't actually wanted to work and that I wouldn't take it serious just by the way I look. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with",0
"If they can handle the equivelent of junior and senior year in the same year then it shows how hard working and out going they are and could benefit them when they`re choosing a collage because:

it could impress the collages they'd want to attend they already know the stress of a collage class because of the extra courses they could be in a better position with organization, and being on time

It would also be a great benefit for students who'd join the work force instead of collage because:

they also know the stress from the extra courses if their family is going through financial problems it gives them more time to work they'd have a head start on their life

The only real problem of this would be the amount of time and stress the student had but thats only limited for the school year.

in conclusion i believe school districts should give students the chance to graduate early if they are willing to put the time and effort of two years into one and face the obstacles that come with it. itd be very beneficial to the student and/or their family and create a great layout for them fro what ever comes next.. If the students willing to sacrifice their time, elective course, and really work to get to their goal of graduating a year early then they deserve it.

From the process it takes to graduate a year before it would seem that yes, they are attending school for less time but from the courses in summer or evening theyre putting the same if not little change in time of the average high school student in just that one year. school districts should allow students to graduate one year early but only if they took the courses",0

Becauase not everyone is agree with all this that happens in the school, a four-day school week have good ideas and bad ideas. And i think is better get out early, because some student have something to do, and get out so late is not a good idea for all students.

Some student can be not agree with all this, that extending the school for two hours. But the benefits is that all students only come four-day per week. That's why . Beacuse I think that is not a good idea for all the students, and that can effect because if they working in the afternoon.

For the disagvantage is that we can be out so late, and that is something that not everyone liked, and the benefits is that is only four-day per week. To all student because we can be out to late.

"Im agree so the student can basically learn more on this time, but if it is putting one hour and half more should give some type of food or snack for them, because on this time the student will be hungry and too tired to stay on school studding, but i'm agree with idea because a lot of parents or guardians go to work early and just come back tonight and cannot stay home for caring they children and this one and half hour it will be to much helpful for the parent/guardians and also teachers who like to teach.

Will be helpful for the learning of the kids because all the hours on school is good for the learning and you can learn more and more all days on school in this time, and when they put this one hour and half it will be good for all because also the family as the teacher like too see that person is learning something different that you teach them to do it.

Getting perspective about the life, and will know that life is not that easy because it have they good this and they bad things happening all time around them.

When they put more time for the school the student can enjoy what they want and what they like example:Sports, Math, Science, Technology, English, Arts, Library or chess club that is the examples what the student can choose, they whatever he wants for their fun on that time and this good time will open the mind of the kids.

Because of this time they can like more school and he can stay everyday and also can choose what you like and what you want to do it for learning different things on school, is not too much time but but they gonna have a lot of fun and and this open the eye of them so they can see that school is not just boring for them ,but you can also have a lot of fun.

If i wold give a suggestion or a complement on this i just will say it about snack for the people who is staying more time than others, because it will provide that the student do not get weakness, sickness or heading, for some reason this can be affected if you do not eat something all day .",0

To help our parents, we can offer to do chores around the house. We can volunteer at a soup kitchen, work at a local animal shelter, or become a mentor for at-risk youth. We can go for walks or jogs, take part in sports, or even do home workouts. 

By taking the initiative to help our parents, help our community, and be active for our health, we can use our time more efficiently and start to accomplish more in life.. We can also assist with taking care of our siblings or other family members, such as providing companionship or running errands. For example, we can help with the laundry, cooking meals, or grocery shopping. Exercise not only boosts our mood, but helps us stay healthy and well. 

Finally, we can take care of our physical health by staying active. 

Next, we can help our community by volunteering our time. This will not only free up some of our parents' time, but it will also provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction for us. We can help our parents, help our community, and be active for our health. These activities give us an opportunity to be part of something larger and support the people in our community. 
Our lives can be enriched when we take on the responsibility of doing more",1
"We choose our own character traits becouse we can choose if something affect ourself for three reasons:

First, if somenthing is doesn't matter for you, it will doesn't affect you. Some people when someone is losing the control of her ennoyance and want to fight, they don't do anything because they are passive.

However, I know sometimes it is difficult something it doesn't affect ourself because sometimes it relate to family, or somenthing is really matter for us.

In conclusion, we choose our own character traits because we can choose if something affect ourself.. Some people when have a problem in her workplace want to resolve the problem because they are passive

Third, if you discuss about something to someone and the person is losing the control of ennoyance, you won't response back because you don't want more problems. Some people when lose something material and they don't care the material things, they looking for a solution,

Second,

if you get a problem in your workplace, you would like to resolve the problem",0
"It's important to consider the practicalities of the job, such as the level of education required and potential earnings. 
Choosing a career at a young age can be a difficult and impactful decision. It's also worth taking into account the potential emotional and financial effects of such a commitment on both the student and their family. Making a commitment to a particular profession can open exciting doors and opportunities, but it can also lead to feelings of obligation and higher stress levels. For high school students looking to start down a career path, course selection should be based on what will ultimately lead to success in a chosen field. It's important to maintain a sense of independence and autonomy while still making sound decisions for the future.. Of course, students need to explore all of their options and understand the pros and cons of committing to a particular career",1
"I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home.                           ",0
"Are first impression almost impossible to change? Most people would say no, but actually it is possible. Always remember will is power.

Second of all, willing something is just the first part to change our first impression. You never know if that will affect your future. Challenges are part of life, so don't see them as impossibles, but see them as oportunities. You need to have a vision of how you want to change it. The hard work is probably the most complicated, becasue is where you gonna find some challenges. You can take classes to gain cofidence like me which is helpful. Changeing your fist impression is a good start. Always have a clear vision og what you do.

Finally, this is probably the most importamt part, confidence. You just need willingness, hard work, and a litle of confidence.

First of all, if you want to change any first impression, you have to will it. Don't let anything to stop you.

Inconclusion, think about your future is very important. I'm not cofident person but took the JROTC class which has help me to be more confident amd not olny that, I have learned to be a leardership too. Just will it, work har for it, and be confident.        . Most people try to change their first impression, but the thing is they don't have a vision. You have to work hard to reach your goal, no matter what. Confidence plays a big roll to change our fisrt impresion. Without a vision you are going nowhere, you most have a vision. If I can do it, that mean you can. Lots of people give up but I know you can do it, because failure is not an option. If your not a cofident person, it migth be hard for you to change but not impossible. Keep this in mind life is not fair, so you better keep doing and don't look back of what have you done",0
"Some students have classes that left many homework, so that means that they may need more time to finish their assignments. Most of the students forget easily that they have homework, for example; Sometimes when I get home and I started doing some of my labors and when I notified it is already time to sleep, so they next day I do not have any time to finish it. I have a job after school and sometimes my tiredness is huge that it does not let me finish my homework, and I can tell that it is really difficult, so having this experience I think that it would be really good that school allow students use their cellphones in the classrooms to educational purposes.

Another reason is that students will have the chance to check their grades or assignments. Whatever they are incorrect because students will a better way to learn, in which one they will feel comfortable. Also some students have jobs after school, for example. Some schools use cellphones in the classrooms for educational purposes. They are just finding better ways for us to learn and educate better because they want us to succeed in school, like in our lives. May be the pass generations think that the use of too much technology, like allow the use of cellphones in the classrooms is a bad idea because it will make our brains slow is not true it just help us to learn in a better way.

In conclusion, the school allowing the use of cellphones in the classroom will have a positive effect because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and they will learn better. . The point is make feel that they can learn in an interesting way, for example; Some teachers let students play trivia games on their cellphones, so students can learn and have a good time doing it. The future is on our hands and make it easy is our decision. Allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom may have a positive effect in the education of the students, who use their cellphones frequently. They will learn better because most of the things that students look in their phones they are capable to memorize it. Moreover some students have personal issues, for example; Sometimes I can not focus in do my homework because I may have a problem that blind my mind and that makes me feel stressful, and that does not let me work on it. We are the new generation and the future of the next one, we have the help of technology to get a better knowledge. Some students miss school and they probably does not if have assignments, or they does not have time to check it in home. In other words, it will make students feel better about doing their classwork. Because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and students will learn better.

One positive effect of allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom is that students will have a chance to finish their classwork or homework. Also ask for help to the teacher if they does not know how to do it, for example; I had a friend that math is hard for him, so he check his assignments in the classroom and ask the teacher for help to understand better, so I think it will help students to get their grades better.

Some people say that the allow of using cellphones can cause a negative effect is because it will distract students, for example; some teachers say that students will be doing something else, like texting or playing video games, in other words students will not pay attention in class. Therefor it will be good to most of the students check what they are missing during class, and they can probably ask the teacher for permission if they can work on what they are missing",0

However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software.

"With my newfound confidence, I've even begun to travel to different states and connect with more musicians.

Along the way, I've learned several important lessons about the world and myself; most notably, that music is a powerful form of expression and communication. As the months went by, I began to grow more confident in my abilities and found that I was able to communicate better with others. I joined a local orchestra and had the pleasure of making new friends who shared similar interests. From this experience, I've gained an appreciation for music, made wonderful new friends, and learned more than I ever could have imagined..

"I don't think isn't good idea for students to commit to a career at young age.

It has come to my attention that some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career and my position on this issue is properly to not makes that they aren't allowed to indentify a career at a young age from selected to guide them toward a specific career because for all of those who has a career and is because their are worked hard to arrive from they are and they get to propose.

Currently they can't have a commit to a career at young age, because for that has to be prepared and work hard nobody can has a commit to a career at young age.

for that you need to finish high school and college and work for the career you want.

Thanks for considering my opinion let me know if you have any question we can contact any assistance.

"Furthermore, students may be at a disadvantage when moving on to higher education in terms of maturity, as they may not have had the chance to experience the same academic and social challenges as their older peers. Additionally, students may benefit from increased career opportunities that may come with graduating from high school at an earlier age. Lastly, some students may find themselves unprepared for the rigors of college if they haven't had the benefit of a full high school experience. One of the main advantages of graduating early is that students gain an early start on their educational journey. For instance, students may miss out on some social activities and experiences that come with being in high school with peers. 

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to graduating from high school early. 
Graduating from high school early with all required credits can be a beneficial option for some students, however, it's important to understand the advantages and disadvantages before making a decision. This means that students can start pursuing their college education earlier, allowing them to potentially save money on tuition by graduating sooner or using their earned credits towards future higher education. 

In conclusion, graduating from high school early with all required credits is a great option for some students, but it's important to be aware of the potential advantages and disadvantages before making a decision.",1

"That learning in experience knowing not everybody is the same.

Working alone helps but I feel in a group is more beneficial. Also in the long run With jobs, family, neighbors, or starting a protest will help if being in a group.. For example playing in a team sport working with teammates is better than trying to do every thing alone, same thing with a big project.

Just like the saying two heads are better than one. What are the benefits of working with a group vs working alone. Working alone isn't bad because their no one to rely on. Because it helping on people skill. Then and working with a group is more beneficial. Working by your self is not helping the team or people skills. Not only that if a person is stuck on something the group with help out to solve it together, also it will save a lots of time trying to work by yourself.

Being in a team that the PE teacher assign you, will be hard trying to play alone in a group or team. Another benefits of working in a group is more ideas coming from different people and taking that you can learn from it. In the long run getting a job there will be times when needed to work with co workers or bosses, doing group projects or playing for a team will benefit that. reasons being said are more people more ideas, getting help from teammates, and will be less mistake because there more than one person to get help. Being alone there going to be mistake because no one will correct you on the paper. Therefor more mistakes could happen, limit to some ideas and knowledge, and can't get help because every one is working alone. Doing work in a group helps students be wake, reasons for that is there someone to talk to also it will be less work and save good amount of time. Students attend to dose off or stress when it to much work on their hands.

In conclusion I prefer working in a group feel more beneficial then working alone. defiantly when working on a project. It will defiantly help in school if a student is doing a project or playing for a team. There no motivation being alone it attend to be boring",0
"Also, it would be a good opportunitie for them to get done their career at a young age and start making money from what they are apassionated on it farthermore, some young people are interest in work on what they like and this could be a great apportunitie for them to commit to a career and start workin on what they have been apassionated on it and get a job that it would be able to made their families proud of them.

Commit a career at a young age give people the responsability to help their families and support them and with the time people at a young a age get more mature in life ,inorder for people to have a great future in life they should take their own responsabilities and learn from their mistake and with the past of time people learn how important life it's ;while people are gettting more elavate then others peple start to descriminate others who are down don't let people wash your head

,always be you because ,today you are up and tomorrow no body no it don't let appearance cheat on you.

Parents have to give support their child with the decision to commit a careeer at a young age, because that's what they want; don't be desagree with them because the only thing that they want is to be independent and lot of mothers don't let their childs be an adult; farthermore, mother's have to impulse their child to make their own decisions and let them learn from their mistakes.

If their sons/daughters go to work or finish their careers far away from their homes it will hurt to their families, understand they're been more adults them your litles baby's no more it doesn't matter if they are your adorations let them be free.

In conclusion,people are allow to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes and next time they can make better decisions to allow them to choose the better opportunities people put on their life inorder to know what's right and wrong and wich make them to be more responsibles and mature in life.

Many have come to realize that life doesn't always is pink color ,people have to make their best effort doesn't mater if you fall down or make mistakes ,wake up and do it again until you do it right.. It is not a good idea that the students commit to a career at a young age, because it will be to complicataed and difficult for them to take high school classes and their college classes at the same time , however if their high school are select to guide them toward a specif careeer let them take similar classes for example first week high school classes, and second week college classes that way they will not struggle in both differents courses and they can graduate with good grades ",0
"People should approach these situations with self-awareness and a willingness to make a genuine effort to break the ice and come to mutual understanding. 

One way to improve a negative first impression is to be friendly and engaging, even when the other party may not be. This often helps to break the ice and can create a sense of trust between both parties. People often draw conclusions about each other from first encounters. Open, confident body language can help demonstrate openness to engaging in conversation, while a sour or displeased demeanor can give off a negative impression.

Lastly, a person can display an understanding and consideration through their words and actions to help move away from a negative first impression. 

Take the case of John, who was viewed as gruff and abrasive upon his first introduction to the team. Additionally, it is important to remain aware of one’s body language and facial expressions. 
First impressions are a vital part of the social experience. Fortunately, individuals who are faced with a negative first impression can take conscious steps to turn things around. With the right perspective and actions, any negative first impression can be turned around.. This can involve actively listening and responding honestly and genuinely. In some cases, a negative first impression can cause a person to be viewed in a less than favorable light and can lead to false assumptions about one’s character. Through actively engaging with his team members and displaying a more understanding attitude in conversations, John eventually became well liked and respected by everyone.

Ultimately, it is possible to transfer a negative first impression through conscious effort and dedication",1
"Student should commit to a career at young age they will save more money, and they will independet at young age also they can work and study at the same time when they get out from High School it would to be more easier that career they want to take and you have that help of the teachers during freshman year until you finish high school. However for people who was independet during high school they already know how life is and it would be more easier to to leave their family,sometimes parents they don't allow you to live in another state or country because they say that you are the only daughter or son but what i said you got to do whatever you got to do to do someone on this life. But if you want a good career you need to start at young age some people leave their family right after they finish High school. School is your second home becuase school will take you to your goal, teachers are you support if you don't have support from your family, but you got support from your good friends,and teacher. Otherwise if you don't have support from your family do never stop looking for your goals because than they will be proud of you,sometimes family give you their back when you most need a support from your own blood,but sometimes you don't have any support from them and makes you sad,depresed. But at end of the day you have your teacher that they will never let you make you stop from who you want to be. That's why is a good idea to to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

In conclusion,age doesn't matter to make a dream,there's many reasons to stop your goals but do never let anything or any person stop your goal but you always going to have a support of your teacher and family,sometime you might not have any support but never stop doing what you want to be because at the end of the day you will be proud of yourself.. When you want to become someone on this life you got to do whatever you have to do no matter if you need to work and study at the sametime. For example some parents are immingrant on this country and they did not have the opportunity that you have now so,they need to undesrtand that you want to make them pround and let you be who you want to be on this life.

Also you always have the support of the teachers during High school they will always going to push you foward it would make your future more easy because they will give you choices of that career that you want to take and help you on your classes if you are not passing a class they will give you homework to get your grades up at the end of the year you ready to the next step",0
"That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want.

I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. I would have to agree with otherwise you try to do something in other side what you have is already mastered, you will never be successful, because whatever you have in your life is still nothing you should have a specific goal for you future, enough confidence, and demonstrated yourself.

Everyone should know what he/she want to be so they must prepare them selves for what they need to be, like working hard in order to achieve development in there ways. We all should believing to ourselves and use our abilities in right ways if there is a wish, there is a way for it. Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone.

In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful. I want to tell about my friend Generic_Name that he is an engineer, he use be one those people that they think they can't do any thing in lives to find the way of success but he went for it to get it, thats way he is an excellent example for me.              . Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help can't solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect.

As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I don't want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations",0
"Having the assistance of someone from a different age group helped me to better understand difficult concepts, provided helpful tips for passing the test, and increased my motivation to keep studying. Communication between different generations is essential for this program to succeed, as insights and perspectives from both younger and older students can be mutually beneficial.

Personally, I benefitted greatly from using Two is better than One while studying for my driving license exam. I will forever be thankful for the experience Two is better than One gave me.. I learned that having a helping hand, even if it’s from an unlikely source, can make the biggest of challenges seem more achievable. 
    Two is better than One is an innovative program that seeks to bridge the divide between younger and older generations by promoting collaboration and inter-generational understanding. The program promotes the idea that success can be achieved through failure, as knowledge and understanding is gained every time a challenge is attempted",1
"Giving a break to students in the evening and all summer, is better for their process of graduation. The students can get more experience while they are reaching to their goal which is their graduation.

In high school, every student should have at least an idea of what they are going to be dedicating themselves for the rest of their lives, and most of them suffer by not knowing what career to choose. It would not be a recommendable period of time having three years of high school for students that still need to keep studying and preparing themselves for the career that they are going to study in college. It would be unfair for them to have to not enjoy that much their summer with their children just because the students have courses during the summer.

Another reason of why students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating, is because after they graduate, they are more prepared for the career they decide doing. Summer is a season in which students need to go out in vacations and spend time with their family as well. Giving students more time for this particular decision is a good way to let them know what they are capable of doing in their future.

In conclusion, students having four years of high school includes many benefits that can help them to be more prepared for college, rest more in summer, and giving them a better process of high school for their future in college and job. That is why, students must do the traditional four years of high school before graduating.

First of all, since students have so much schoolwork and homework to study, they often need a break, so that way they can relax in their home and do other activities with their family that are not related to school. It is known, that students truly enjoy the most they can any break of the year. Most parents have from their jobs summer break, and they prefer enjoying it together with their children. Students can challenge themselves by experiencing the traditional four years of high school and see the advantages of the result that they reached which will be very beneficial for them. Generally, not every students and their families get to spend so much time all together in the evenings, that is because of their routine. Some students may say that they would really wish graduating as soon as possible, but the fact is, that by being in a hurry of getting out of high school with a diploma, they would make the mistake by maybe choosing the wrong career in college for themselves, or even maybe deciding to not go to college just because they did not have the enough time of high school to think and decide the options that colleges offer.

Music, drama, and art classes are valuable tools in any student's educational journey. Allowing students to make their own decisions when selecting their courses can give them a stronger sense of ownership over their learning experience, which can lead to a greater investment in their academic education.

In addition, providing students with control over their participation in activities such as music, drama, and art can reveal to them new directions that their talents might take them in the future. Giving these students the freedom to explore their own interests in a safe and encouraging learning environment could end up having a remarkable effect on their futures.

Ultimately, giving students the choice to opt for courses such as music, drama, and art reinforces the fact that learning doesn't have to be confined to traditional classroom curricula and can be an exciting journey of self-discovery. Giving students the choice to select their own path of learning through one of these three classes allows them to discover which activities they most enjoy and in which their passions truly lie.

Furthermore, studies have shown that incorporating the arts into education increases overall student engagement, as well as helps to foster a sense of community. This freedom of choice can be a powerful opportunity to positively shape students academically and personally over their schooling years.. Not only do they provide an outlet for creative expression, they can also serve as a platform for teaching invaluable life lessons",1
"I think that students should start an after school homework club. My 3 reasons that students can have a easier time doing their assignments is that the students can ask their teachers for assistance if they need it, they'll get their work done quicker, and when their teachers come to collect their work, the students will have it already completed.

My second reason is that the students can work together to get their homework done. My 3 reasons that students should work together to get their homework done is so that they can turn it into their teacher once they're done, they'll have it all completed when their teacher asks the students to give their homework up, and they'll receive a good grade from their teacher.

My third reason is that students can work with their teacher to raise their grades up in a specific subject. 3 reasons I think that students should start this club is so that they'll have an easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them, they can work together to get their homework done, and students can work with their teachers to raise their grades up in a specific subject.

My first reason is that students can have a easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them. My 3 reasons that students should work with their teachers to raise their grade up in a specific subject is so that they can be more productive in class, they can catch up on what they've missed in class, and the teacher can guide the students on what they're confused on on their homework.

Overall, these are my reasons why I think that students should have the opportunity to have an after school homework club.",0
"If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy",0
"It is only through taking an active role in gaining knowledge and putting it to use that positive results and growth can be observed.

School programs that pair older and younger students together can be an effective way of helping students in the areas of social adjustment, understanding new classes and forming better study habits. 

When implemented appropriately, these types of school programs can be of great benefit to students in aiding academic achievement. 

On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to these programs, such as potential feelings of intimidation or jealousy for younger students in the presence of their older peers. Benefits of these programs include helping younger students foster positive relationships with their peers, as well as providing guidance and mentorship through experienced upperclassmen. Overall, these programs offer unique and valuable experiences for students in the form of educational support and personal development.. Furthermore, these programs can be used as a space in which students can develop beneficial communication and problem-solving skills. By forming these mentor-mentee partnerships, younger students can receive assistance in areas like homework help, exam preparation and overcoming academic obstacles. It is also an opportunity for students to develop confidence, resilience and self-sufficiency. Additionally, some students may be resistant when they have been placed in a mentor-mentee relationship with someone who is unfamiliar to them",1
"For one, playing catch is a good activity to enjoy with others, and to move around. Therefore, riding bikes is an amazing activity for outdoors, you can enjoy riding along the streets, and to enjoy the outside nature by looking around the park and to hear the people playing around having fun outside.

On the other hand, doing any other activities are good to enjoy outside. For example, playing football is a good game to spend time outside practicing or playing with friends, and tag is another game that kids love enjoying outside running around and laughing and playing fair with other childrens on the grass or even just chasing little things that they see, like a dog they like to go after a dog and pet it.

Conclusion. What ever activity is interesting to do outdoors to spend time on, then just do it to enjoy it.. Spending time outdoors with many activities like, playing catch with your friends, or riding bikes around the park and enjoying the nice ride,or even just enjoying doing any other activities of your own outdoors. Picture your self enjoying spending time outdoors playing catch, or riding bikes, or even just doing any other activities.

Its fun to do many activities outdoors and its also good for you to be outside moving around and doing things.

Spending time outdoors are great for doing activities,and to see what other things you can do at parks. People can find that playing catch is a good activity to enjoy outdoors, because most people play it differently and many of them can learn how to play, its also a good way to play fair with others, and to throw/catch a ball.

Secondly, riding bikes is a great activity to do at a park with your family or friends",0
"Some schools districts allow students to graduate within three years. Graduating early would be a great solution for them. Due to his mom's immigration statutes they left Virginia to go to Texas in the summer of 2019 to seek for help. I agree that gradating within three years is a good idea for students who need and choose it. For a standard diploma in the state of Virginia you need 3 math, 3 science,4 history, 4 English, health grade 9 and 10, 2 sequential fine art, and a language. . This is a good idea because of legal statuses, not having financial support, and also some students having almost all required credits.

One reason is my friend Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name lives in Texas he is going to graduate with the class of 2020. Due to some students taking some classes at earlier levels it dulls it all down for them in high school.

Graduating within three years is a good idea it helps students end up with their high school diploma while also helping there problem. Some students want to go into the work force but do not want to effect their academics. Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems.

Lastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level. In fear that his mother would be deported in less than a year he decided he would finish a year earlier than what was expected. This year Generic_Name is taking high level class while still being ahead of the game.

Another reason is some students have no financial support",0

"Failure playes a huge part of becoming successful. Try out day comes and i was ready as i will ever be. Failing tests you on how pationant you are at what you are doing and are you willing to fail again and again to be succesful. I can eather stop playing soccer and choes a diffrent routh or i can pick my head im and try again. He was also a dad with one kid and lived in a motal. A good example would be the book persude of happynes. at the end of the day they gathered every body up and called all the people that made it. Still nobody was willing to buy it off of him. he got kicked out of the motal because he was not able to pay his bills. I did all of those things somedays i did not want to train and just start eating unhealthy but i fought through it. One day my coche tells me that there is a professional soccer try out next week and he want me to get ready. Everyday i have to eat right and train hard. In this book the main person makes a muchen and he wants to sell in. By failing people are learning on how not to make the same mistakes again. we started out with warm ups and went to drills. I was amazing. I have failed to become a pro soccer player. I was not one of them. i was like the best player at the fiald. So he gives me a schedual on what i should be doing to get fit. failure is the key to your success.. The person that bought it told some people on how good the machen was and they started to buy it to. But nobody would buy it. I played for the best clubs, i was named the best player in the team, and i have never been cut from a team. Finaly after his ups and downs somenoe bought his muchean. For example lets say that i was trying to become a professional soccer. So he was homeless for a cuple of weeks. Now this is the part where enthisiasm playes a role. Even though he was homeless that did not stop him from trying to sell his machean. He became successful because he did not give up on his dream even though he was geting regected every time he tryed to sell it",0
"There can also be a risk of miscommunication or discrepancies between the student and local partner. This not only benefits the student personally, but it can often lead to broader, positive effects.. 

However, working with local partners can also come with potential risks. 

In addition, many students find working on local projects opens up the possibility to create long-term solutions to problems in their community. It can provide students with the opportunity to gain valuable real-world experience, build their resume, and network with members of their local community. Such work typically involves tasks like conducting research, problem solving, implementing solutions, working with stakeholders, writing reports, and presenting about their findings. 
Working with local companies and organizations to complete community projects can be a beneficial experience for students. Furthermore, it is important to understand that working locally can involve long-term commitments which may affect the student’s ability to manage their personal and academic responsibilities. It is important that students ensure that they are aware of any safety risks and protocol that comes along with the project",1
"Making good research,planing things out first with a good process will help with their future career.

Most students are not prepare to pick their future career during high school. Most students know that choosing the wrong career could affect the later on in the future. Most students have no knowledge of what they want to be later in life. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Changing their mind in a career could also make them unhappy of have wasted their time with something they was not interested in. When choosing the wrong career, accepting the consequences and restart over again with a new career of their choice. Student should not be required to choose a career by the time they enter to high school, because they are inexperienced to know what they want, students could choose the wrong career, and unhappy of wasting their time on a career they are going to change their mind on.

Inexperienced of not knowing what they want,students could make the take wrong choices about their future career. When students enter to high school they are normally around fourteen years old, young students of that age are normally not worry about their future career yet. students do not have the capacity of choosing their whole future career at the young of age.

When students are force to choose a career when they first enter to high school, they could choose the wrong career. When people work with things they like or enjoy they attempt to work harder and better.

Most people change their mind almost everyday about something they like or do not like, well it is the same with choosing a career. I believe, that kinds mentality about their career will change through out high school. Making kids choose their career at a young age could mess them up and they would have to do things all over again. Lets say that they choose a career when they enter to high school, but they are unhappy. Their courses of study In high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. Students should have enough experience and good knowledge of what their future career before they choose what they want to be.. Many young students do not have the capacity of choosing a career at that time of age. Some students could make the wrong choice of picking a career they do not want. Students mentality starts changing abut their career when they are having more knowledge about what they really what to be. Wasting time is something no one likes to do, and specially when is about their future. When kids are around sixteen is when are maturing about their future and looking at things differently. They are going to be stuck their whole life time with something that does not makes them happy",0
"This can provide a more engaging learning experience compared to traditional classrooms, as students are in charge of their own learning pace and environment. 

However, students attending classes from home can suffer from issues concerning socialization, responsibility, and experience. It is important that students are given the option to choose between the two learning methods in order to create an ideal learning environment.. 
Recent studies on the effects of distance learning on students' learning outcomes have shown both pros and cons. Also, there is comparatively a lack of responsibility and guidance for progress when in an online setting.

Overall, the future of distance learning for students remains, at the very least, uncertain. For those who struggle to learn in a traditional setting, distance learning can provide a great alternative. Equally, traditional classrooms are still preferred by some for a number of reasons, such as social connection and assessment feedback. Without face-to-face communication, many important learning and life skills such as team work, public speaking, and interpersonal communication are lost. On one hand, students who attend classes from home are able to learn in an environment that is tailored to their own individual learning styles",1
"The benefits of good decision-making can bring profound improvements to our lives, our future, and our families. 
Decision-making is an important task that can have significant consequences in our lives, both positive and negative. Taking the time to trust one's own judgement is also vital, as well as developing strong decision-making skills at an early age. Seeking advice from loved ones or a professional can help people make confident decisions and understand their options and outcomes. Being able to make quick and wise decisions can help us work toward our goals and achieve our potential in the long run.",1
"Imagine going to a school that has a longer student release time then any other school, imagine feeling tiered and restless everyday you come home from school, well the school board is about to make that ""dream"" happen for this school.

The school days should not be extended because most of the students will not have a plesent time spending more hours in school, for example most students at the end of the school day feel tiered and they just want to go home and sleep, if an extra hour gets added to the school day most of the students will be angry and agitated.

A second reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because it will be confusing for parents, it will be confusing for parents because most parents have a specific time that they pick up their kids and when the time changes for the students release, parents will get confused and it will be a disaster.

A finial reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because after school courses will be longer, this will be a issue for after school buses because they will have to change their whole schedule for picking up students in the afternoon.

In conclusion, students shouldn't have to have an extra hour added to their school days, and the school board should keep everything the same. ",0

My opinion about this is we shouldn't let this happen for many reasons for example; Students would be waking up late,People got jobs after school and responsivbles after school, Students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. If we would have added two more hours then we wouldn't have sport or staying after, It would probably be late and teachers don't want to stay longer then they should and parnets could get worryed about the kids for staying longer. That they would have to make up which could be hard because they would have to stay after for school if we would have ten hours of school and it would be hard to do it in class. Student's come to school on time and prepare to learn. They do want they have to do after school and everyone is happy with that,Others will be unhappy if we would add two more hours to are day.. These actives could affect students class work, How tired the students get and sore when they come back from school.

In conclusion, We shouldn't add two more hours to the school day for four days a week it could affect students attendents and how they act with others,People have jobs and responsivbles after school and students actives and homework. Having to go to school for four days would be great and all but I would rather go to school for that extra day then just four days for ten hours. Other students they got other thing to do for example vist people family members,having chores to do around the house.

Now,My last reason would be students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. That's why we should keep the school days nomal and how long we stay in school. There are alot of students who stay after for help with there homework, Clubs and sports,some students enjoying staying after and practicing to join the soccer team,foorball team etc. The student attendance would drop a lot, Students would be waking up later on in the day, And would be missing a lot of class work in the moring that could be important. If we would have ten hours of school it would be impossibe to take care of those thing. If we didn't have two hours added to are day then it would be much easier to stay after school, And students would be waking up on time and going to school more often.

Next reason,Some students have jobs after school and responsivbles. Other people would agree with me and my reason why we shouldn't let this happen. Having a job is important some students could be going through tuff times like family issues,Some students even have kids to take care .Some students got a lot to handle that and school work and going to school. I'll give you more detail reasons about why we shouldn't let this happen.

My first reason, Students would be waking up late to school, It's very important to go to school and people waking up late could cause a lot of problems with the government and with parents. Students even have time to work on there homework when they get out of school",0
"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because, you're getting people's opinions and their way of handling a situation people can give you advice that you wouldn't have thought about before and that will help your choice in many ways. Having more opinions does help a lot because they could make someone's choice more beneficial and help someone's way of thinking about better choices, having less people wouldn't really want to persuade someone to make better choices and it wouldn't be that make someone think of a better choice. That's why having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.. The more opinions people give someone, the more likely the choice will be or they will think of a better choice.

Opinions can persuade someone to make a better choice because a good friend or a good person can give his opinion that would make someone want to make a better choice having lots of good opinions can benefit someone's choice and make better choices. Having advice from close ones can be helpful to because they can persuade someone to make choice that will benefit their life and ensure that they will not regret that choice they made in the future.

That's why having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, they help people think of better choice and new ones to, they can persuade people to make better choices, having more opinions can benefit their choice, having more opinions can make someone's choice more beneficial, having more opinions can give someone ideas. Some peoples opinions can support your choice or can go against your choice. Having different opinions can make someone think of a better choice because people give that someone ideas of the choice they're going to make. Getting other people's opinion can help someone think of a better choice and make that choice more helpful to that someone.

Why getting other people's opinions can help someone make a better choice or think of a better choice is because, people can tell you the same thing but in a different wording. Having two or one opinion doesn't persuade someone to make better choices but having five or eight people could make someone want to make better choices because people can be very persuasive and some people wouldn't really listen or care what one or two people say but if its at least five or more then there is chance of that someone might listen or even care because lots of friends and family or even teacher want that someone to make better choices and he or she can't just ignore that unless they want to make bad choices",0
"However, some states may require a student to complete certain classes in order to get their high school diploma. While the traditional four year system is still largely used by most high schools, some schools are considering new ways of teaching with classes that are shorter in duration and more focused on a particular subject. Ultimately, it is important to consider all of these factors when determining the best high school graduation plan for a young student.. For example, students who graduate early may have difficulties enrolling in college or receiving financial aid.

Additionally, it is important to consider if the current system of classes to complete high school should be changed and how. What are the consequences for students that choose to work instead of complete high school? In the USA, once a student turns 18 they are legally allowed to drop out of school. 
When researching various countries school requirements for high school graduation, it is important to consider the pros and cons of graduating early. Additionally, graduating early can have a number of implications for college and universities",1
"On the other hand, it may be difficult to sort out our own preconceptions and remain open-minded. It's amazing how one look or response in a meeting can make our opinion of a person. They can shape our behavior towards a person in an often unintentional or unconscious manner. But what's even more special is that sometimes, these impressions are so powerful that no matter what a person does after, the first impression remains unchanged. That's why it's important to remember that first impressions don't always tell the full story. Despite this, it's important to accept people for who they are and respect them, rather than falling back on our own preconceptions.. 

This can be both a blessing and a curse. 
First impressions are powerful. On the one hand, first impressions may help us pick up on traits of a person we may have otherwise overlooked",1
"It is important to assess the individual needs of our students and provide access to a wide variety of classes, both electives and core classes, which will ultimately prepare them for any career of their choosing.. 
Music, drama, and art classes are often classified as electives, offering students the chance to explore creative subjects in a meaningful and fun way. However, it is important to consider the implications of some students not taking these classes seriously or having an interest in specific jobs that do not require such classes. On one hand, those who are excited and engaged by these topics will be able to broaden their education and pursue topics they are interested in. On the other hand, those who do not find these classes to their liking may be missing out on classes that offer significant life skills, such as team work, communication, and analytical thinking",1
"

Despite the potential downsides, longer school days could be beneficial in the long-term. With more time spent in a learning environment, students could hone their skills and have better access to resources which may help them in achieving their dream in the future. 

Ultimately, whether or not the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day is up for debate. It is essential to consider the short-term and long-term impacts of this decision on students, such as length of class time, standardized testing, recess, and the future success of students.. Additionally, shorter recess periods could lead to an unsatisfactory amount of time for physical activity and communication with peers. This in turn could help to develop their overall understanding of their subsequent academic path, allowing them to be better prepared when the time comes. Also, longer school days may mean longer days for tests and standardized tests such as SOLs, which could lead to exhaustion and an inability to perform to the best of one's ability. 
When discussing the potential for the school board to add one and a half hour to school each day, there are several aspects to consider in order to determine if this is a good decision. Firstly, time spent in classes would be extended which may affect the quality of student interactions with the material in the allotted period",1

"Participating in extracurricular activities can also give students the opportunity to build strong, supportive relationships, which can help them to cope with stress and related issues. Ultimately, extracurricular activities can be an effective way to reduce stress, boost grades, and strengthen family ties.. 
Extracurricular activities can have a positive effect on students, helping to reduce stress, increase grades, and strengthen family relationships. Studies show that students who participate in extracurricular activities have lower levels of stress than those who don't. They also tend to have higher grades, which can lead to improved family relationships, as parents often take an interest in their child's academic progress. Additionally, extracurricular activities provide a sense of purpose and belonging, which can help a student's overall mental wellbeing",1
"Only by recognizing the value of every individual can we strive to cultivate a more equitable society and to combat the bullying that so often threatens our sense of safety and security.. Those who bully can suffer from depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and feelings of guilt. To best address the issue of bullying, it is imperative that we work to create communities that foster understanding and acceptance. Additionally, in some states, bullying can be punishable by law. 
Bullying is a widespread problem in today's society and is a major contributor to the psychological distress of many individuals. This can involve providing support for those who bully, educating people on the consequences of bullying, and encouraging open dialogue about the issue. Unfortunately, the consequences of bullying can be severe. We must also learn to recognize and respect the human dignity of all individuals, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, class, or any other difference. People may resort to bullying because they are seeking validation, feel insecure, or are trying to cope with their own sense of powerlessness",1
"From my experiences I know that most places has really expansive food that is really good. Going to places you have never been to is great. Sometimes traveling depends on where you are going since some places are cheap or expansive. This is why I want my accomplishment to be a high paying job.. Spending our own money lets us buy anything we want. When you want to take your family out to a really nice place or a place where you think they would enjoy or relax, you can just surprise them by already getting it done and paid off. Another reason it is a good idea to get a high paying job, to not spend your family money.

The last reason is trying many different foods that could be expansive. Paying for good expansive food is worth it then paying too much for something that taste bad.

In conclusion that a high paying job is good for traveling to places you've never been to, spending lots of money without using your families money, and eating or buying really expansive foods. I think having a high paying job is good for traveling is not always cheap, you can buy anything you've ever wanted and not worrying much about using to much money.

The next reason is to buy many things as I want without spending any or some of my parents or family members money. I would want a high paying job since it could pay off many things that I don't need to pay later. My reasons is to travel to many places I've never been to, buy many things as I want without spending my family money's, and I would try many different foods that could be expensive.

One reason why my accomplishment is getting a high paying job is to travel around the world or place that I never been to. Traveling around the world could be really expansive since your going to buy many things you would need or don't need. Another reason is going out when you want to and you dont really want to spend your family money because you need a lot since you could be going to many places. I also know that going to a super fancy restaurant is expansive since all the foods could be really good or just a rip off. Having a lot of a good amount while traveling is a good because you could do anything you want with that money while your not at home. Sometimes going to really fun places or vacations foods are expansive because it could taste good and many people would might want to try some, also if it was cheap many people would've gone crazy. Also buying or trying new foods is really nice when you can buy it. The one thing I hope I accomplish is to get a high paying job. This is important because it wouldn't matter much if you used you own money but if you use your family money you might have to pay them back later on",0
"This will make more easier school than having phones during class, school should work more on this and all this is for a better if for good of our country to have better jobs better doctors, nurses etc.

I disagree on this article because cell phones are a distraction for students, i think thats why computers were made to use, to work, study, applications, papers, images and more, school should make this up and let students use a computer in class better than phone use, like i said do it for a better life, for more knowledge, to be safe and prepared for any circumstances that can show up to life.. Students think that cell phone use will make easy to study and to get high grades, every teacher, students and parent are debating if they should let students use the phone during class.

Cell phones can be used for good reasons like study look for information, thats right that make school easier but at the same time is a distraction for students, because cell phones not only can be use to study, they can be use to communique play video games and thats a distraction for every student. ""Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose think about the effects of allowing students, to have and use cell phones in the classroom. That makes everything go back works instead of going forward.

also cell phones make easier for teacher to grade, now you can scan papers with phones and you can make grades for every student, but still is a distraction, am saying this because I am a student and the same happens to me, i know what it is and i think we should not use cell phones during class not even to do homework or anything relacionated with school.

To not have those types of problems we should let have every student have a computer, computer are more useful to search for problems, articles, to write etc",0
"The city boasts a strong job market, competitive educational institutions, and a supportive government leadership. Everyday resources and services are welcome additions that often make it easier for citizens and immigrants to manage daily needs and activities. Overall, my experience living in Generic_City has been a positive one.. 

The culture and society in Generic_City differ from those of United States in several ways; language barriers, economic developments, and school systems are all examples of distinguishing characteristics. Despite these unique differences, visitors can often find similar recreational activities that bring together old and new cultures alike. 
Generic_City is a rapidly changing destination that offers a variety of socioeconomic opportunities for immigrants from all walks of life. 

As an immigrant, I am able to relate to the difficult journey of leaving one’s home in pursuit of a better life. The experiences of being an immigrant can be both challenging and rewarding; I have encountered both opportunities and obstacles, but ultimately am grateful for the growth and progress",1
"Showing appreciation for someone’s hard work or providing words of encouragement can leave them feeling good. 
In our increasingly impersonal world, the power of small acts of kindness can often be forgotten. Such simple gestures can go a long way in helping to strengthen a bond between two individuals, or even within a whole community.

No matter how small, paying it forward can brighten someone’s day. From family members and friends to colleagues and complete strangers, we can make a difference in the lives of others through small acts of kindness.

Small acts of kindness can help to reinforce positive connections between people. By remembering to take even the smallest opportunities to offer kindness and compassion, we can create a happier, more connected society.. For example, when walking down the street, hold the door for the person behind you or say ‘good morning’ with a smile. A single smile, a pat on the back and a few kind words can have a big impact on the lives of those around us. One person’s positive reaction to a small act of kindness can help to spread joy to other people in their lives, and even around the world.

Therefore, it is clear that small acts of kindness can have a big impact on others",1
"Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example

Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor

Help an old person cross the road

Teach kids how to write neatly

This kind of program could help the environment so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives.  . The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example

United Kingdom

Norway

Sweden

Denmark

Canada

And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It can help so much for others and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future and they can also help their families and other families. It can also be a great hobbies for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for example

They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers

They can teach how to welcome people

It also helps them to have a great future

The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students",0
"However, this option may not be suitable for students who have difficulty keeping up with a faster pace of studies. Additionally, a student's sleep schedule and potential for financial aid or scholarships may be affected. 
Graduating high school in three years instead of four is an option that many students are beginning to consider.  Ultimately, while graduating early may have its advantages, it's important to evaluate the individual needs and goals of each student, and decide whether it is a beneficial and viable alternative to a traditional four year program.. While it may provide a number of financial and educational benefits, there may be some drawbacks that need to be taken into account. One of the obvious pros is the ability to save time and money, and graduate college at a younger age",1
"You can also take a picnic to the park, bringing blankets and snacks to sit and enjoy with friends or family. Seeing different types of birds, from majestic eagles soaring in the sky to feathered warblers chirping in the trees, can provide a relaxing and peaceful experience. 
One of the most enjoyable ways to spend time at a park is bird watching. If you're looking for something more interactive, many parks offer organized sports such as group softball games or fishing derbies. So when you're ready for a break from the everyday, why not visit your local park and find out what's possible?. Other activities like reading, jogging, and bike riding can fill a day in the park with fun",1
"However, it is possible to overcome any obstacle if we are persistent and remain positive.

To illustrate the potential for success, there are countless success stories of people who have managed to accomplish difficult goals. I will use multiple sources to illustrate the potential success stories, while also discussing potential obstacles and how to handle them. My essay will ultimately emphasize the courage and drive that it takes to accomplish goals and ultimately capture success.. 
When attempting to achieve a goal, most of us are motivated by personal success and the fulfillment of our ambitions. It is proof that anything is possible if we set our minds to it.

In drafting an outline for my essay, I will focus on how to best accomplish goals as well as why it is important to stay motivated. Thomas Jefferson was one of the most driven historical figures of our time, and he never shied away from a challenge. There will always be challenges that stand in our way, such as large workloads, financial barriers, and lack of time. From completing college while facing financial hardship to earning a six-figure salary, these stories can provide inspiration and fuel our ambition. His philosophy to accomplishment was simple yet effective; set a goal, plan out the steps it would take to reach that goal, and relentlessly pursue it until success was achieved. He recognized that obstacles were inevitable and that the path toward success might be a long and marked with pitfalls, but he persevered until he accomplished his goals.

Today there are various strategies that we can use to effectively accomplish a goal, such as breaking it down into manageable steps, identifying realistic deadlines, and staying motivated by celebrating small milestones along the way",1
"Anyway, what informato can give us technology in our entire life. In the rest rest of this eassy i will say that why limitation of contact to the use of technoloy is important and has positive effects. In additaion, techonloy has alot information which is we need for now, past and for our future. Has the limitation of humans contact due to the use of technology had positive effects on peopl;s lives . Every one knows that without technology life is hard but, if we have to save our health aslo. technology can change our life without technology we can not contact the world with humans and information about world.

In conclusion, i have to sat that has humans limitation of contact to use technology because has positive efects. We have take care our healt and body to save from dengeours happening with technology. I will explain why we should have limitation of contact ot using technolohg.

First,Why limitation of contact to the use of technology is important and has positive efects; It seems to me that , when i used to much my phone i feel so pain in my eyes and head because i didn't had limitation of contact to the use of my phone. For example some people destoiyerd their eyes because of using to mach technology.

Third,what inforamtion can give us technology in our entire life. Also, limitation of humans contact to the use oftechnology is good for our healt and body.

Second, limitation of humans contact to the use of technology good for our health and body because when we use alot our body going to hurt and we always feels sick and we can not eath food as much is we need, feell deperessed.

that's why limitation of humans contact to the use of technology has positive efects. And phone,computers .... Finally, in my opnion technology can help us alot in our whole life but, also can destioyrd our life. With technology our life giong to easy also can hurt oue life.",0

The move to a healthier menu has also not been proven to be beneficial in the short or long term. According to a survey conducted by ABC News, over two-thirds of students dislike certain dishes on the school's menu. While some may appreciate the change, others are vehemently opposed, believing that endangering the established school lunch menu is an unnecessary move. Furthermore, the introduction of these dishes has also failed to take into account the traditional favorites of many students. This has created a negative atmosphere, one in which kids dread lunchtime, rather than look forward to it. This type of adaptation would make dishes more nutritious without having to completely change the menu.

Ultimately, the introduction of healthier options to the school lunch menu is an unnecessary switch with more drawbacks than rewards and may be more of a hindrance to students rather than a help. A study conducted by the National Institute of Health reveals that while healthier choices may promote better eating habits in the long run, students do not immediately feel compelled to choose more nutritious options when given the chance.

One possible solution would be to introduce healthier options without taking away existing favorite dishes. For instance, introducing salads and wraps to the menu with hints of carrot, celery, and lettuce, or adding fruits and vegetables to existing dishes. 

In recent years, many schools have attempted to improve student health by introducing a brand-new health-conscious menu to the school lunchroom. This could include incorporating nutritious ingredients into the cooking process. It is important to take into account the traditional dishes that students may enjoy in addition to introducing new healthier options in order to make lunchtime an enjoyable experience for all.. 

Research indicates that many students simply do not like the taste of the new dishes and fail to find them appetizing",1
"I agree with this prompt about the first impression, based on my own experience and for what I've seen in myself is related or better said similar on my every day life, and what I really mean by that is: First impression that we show it won't change that easy as many people expect to change between one month to a year, not because we couldn't change it but because this is who we are, also because this is how we act and it won't change because is part of ourselves.

In addition to this prompt i think it might be impossible to change our first impression not because we can't change it, but it'll be because is part of our personalities, in my case should I say is part of how I really am, how my culture distinguish me, that's what makes me unic and by trying to change a part of me it would make me feel empty, because first impression means a lot to me and is all thanks to my past experiences that I've been through.

In conclusion to this paragraph i think that first impression is important, it helps you to understand how a person is, also it helps you to analyze that one person, and most of all i think it helps a lot when you're patient when trying to understand others at the first time, sometimes or most of the time people would judge others by their first impression without seeing what's really their intention, this is what I think about it, we shouldn't judge just by the first time you meet someone even if you think that person is an stranger, just give them a change to prove you're wrong with their actions and their way to treat people, thank you.",0
"

However, sometimes family, external pressures, or even fear of failure can impede a student from pursuing their dreams. One way to do this is to take advantage of the resources offered by schools, like the help of teachers and access to career counselors. Even if the odds may be stacked against them, students should find the courage to follow their passions and use the resources available to them to turn their dreams into reality.. By starting to research and think about a career path early on in life, students can save themselves money and time in the long run. Furthermore, commitment to a career can help create a sense of independence, allowing students to make crucial decisions for their own future. 
In today's increasingly competitive job market, it is important for students to commit to a career path at a young age. It is important for students to remember that their career path should not be dictated by anyone else, and that personal ambition is a virtue",1
"

Personally, I have experienced this change in opinion firsthand. After becoming close friends with one of my colleagues at work, I was able to look past the physical and professional barriers we initially had between us and appreciate the qualities that made them so unique. 
First impressions have a great power to shape our interactions and relationships with others, in both social contexts and business settings. I initially got the impression that this person was cold and unfriendly, however, after continuing to talk and hang out with them, I was able to see the friendly, humorous, and creative person they are. My own experience has shown how the best friendships or business relationships may often begin with a completely different impression to the one you are left with.. 

In conclusion, it is clear that first impressions can be significantly altered after getting to know someone better, regardless of the environment. When meeting someone new, we establish initial thoughts and opinions of that person based on behavior, appearance, and initial interactions. The same can be said for a friend I made in college. However, these impressions can change drastically after getting to know a person better and seeing multiple sides to their personality and character",1

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be incredibly beneficial when making important decisions in life. For example, seeking guidance from a financial advisor when making major investment decisions can help to ensure the decisions are informed by the current market conditions, and will ultimately result in a much more profitable return on the investment. 

Further, a mentor or life coach can be incredibly helpful when it comes to personal growth. Similarly, when considering major career changes, a school or university career advisor can help identify the most beneficial courses to take and the most advantageous job prospects available to an individual. By seeking advice from experts and authorities when considering major life decisions, people can gain the clarity and support they need to make sound decisions that lead to successful outcomes.. By cultivating an open relationship with someone who has more experience, people can gain the insight and advice they need when navigating personal challenges, and make more sound and holistic decisions as they evaluate professional and personal options.

When it comes to life's important decisions, having the right guidance can be a game changer. Having an outside source to help make choices can often lead to more successful outcomes, as they are often experienced professionals who can offer valuable, unbiased advice",1
"These programs are designed to teach the younger generations a variety of skills, such as walking, social etiquette, and respect for others. In the United States, the Big Brothers Big Sisters program operates on a national level, pairing older students with at-risk youth in an effort to provide mentorship and guidance. It is believed that these programs not only provide educational opportunities, but also open job prospects and give participants the chance to explore talents they may never have realized before.

Moreover, programs like these could have a positive impact on the environment. 

All in all, programs involving older students helping younger students, provide a great benefit for all involved, as well as for the environment. For example, an increase in mentorship opportunities for younger generations may lead to increased understanding and appreciation for nature.

Many countries around the world have implemented similar programs tailored to their specific objectives. For instance, in Denmark, there's a program called udvekslingsstudent, in which older students from Danish high schools mentor their younger counterparts in both academics and extracurricular activities. With more research, more organizations and countries may deploy these programs in the future..

There are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you can't depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?. Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I don't study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on.

Thomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! that's how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...Its is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like ""Yes! I did it!""and that way they won't have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should. We the people shouldn't be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isn't as bad. People who don't motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;I'm writing.

An inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who don't accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?

The way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done. Also you want to have a break,so you won't stress out as much.                                                                                                                                                 . In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media.

In my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus.

For us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life",0
"Providing these extra opportunities could benefit students who need extra help, while still protecting the students from too much exhaustion. After researching the pros and cons of changing the school day, I believe that there should be a balance between the traditional length of the school day and the addition of extra time for electives and tutorials for students who need extra help. On the one hand, there is the argument for a longer school day, which may provide extra time for various electives and tutorials that can help students who need extra assistance. 
The debate over the traditional school day is a prevalent one among educators, students, and parents alike. In my opinion, this balance is essential for a successful school day.. On the other hand, proponents of the traditional school day argue that this extra time has the potential to be too demanding and may lead to student fatigue",1
"For example if you are at work and some one provoke you and you reack to the provoke you could lose your job.    . What I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to say was that if we help others we wold be doing a lot for others. the second reason that I agree is that I think we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. I also belive by bing nice to people you could make there day better because you dont know if that peson had a bad day at work or something bad hapen.

Seconly I agree with THomas Jefferson writing because we can accomplish more if we are always doing some thing. I also belive that Thomas Jefferson writing stans out for those people that dont have a home or a family y that can suport them if you can try to make that person day better by getting them a some water or food. Thats why i think if you go an talk to your boss when some one is causing you problems is better if you react an you lose your job for not contlroling your self.

In conclution I think we should help any one that needs the help and not just think that they would be fine because we dont konw what they been throug and we would like for some one to help us when we are in troble or when we are not dong well. For example if we see someone that is tring to cross the street and they cant do it by them self because of a bad weather or because that person has a disability you should help that person because belive it or not you would make that person day. I agree with this writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something. Lastly but not less I think that inactivity also can serve a purpose.

The firs reason that I agree with Thomas Jefferson writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing some thing. I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to tell us not to givre up.

Lastly but not less I belive that inactivity also can serve a purpose. If you get in troble because some one you and you keep the problem going it can afect you later on when you going to get a new job because they going to see that you cant control your self. I think it also meen that is that if you are working and you dont know how to do it ask for help like that the next time you do it you can do it better. Inactivity also can serve a purpose because if some one is provoking you and you jump up and keep it going then there can be some problems. For exampel if you are tring to pass a class or a SOL try your best and no matter how much you fell get up and get up stronger and keep tring. I agree with the writing ""

Determine never to be idle

"The American jazz legend Duke Ellington was famous because of jazz music for being so good at what he did.

he said this phrase "" A problem is chance for you to do your best"" and what the means is that if theres a problem with something you can try your best or do your best to fix that problem think of a solution or make a solution or to that problem to do good and keep going forward to fix that problem and that's the meaning of the phrase hat Duke Ellington said.

The phrase that Duke Ellington said is a good phrase and i totally agree with it because the problem you have or that you will get is a chance for you to do you best at fixing it or solving because the problem will give you a chance to do your best unlike if you come across a problem of just get a problem and you dont try to fix it or dont care or sit back and just watch your problems just pile up and then problems just come and come one after another then you have more then one problem and its just better if you do good on your first problem and you fix an if its big problem and you over come it at the end you will feel great like Duke Ellington he is now legend at jazz music and you know t is not easy to get were he got to be called a legend at jazz music and on his way to the top to become a legend all ways remembered every were you go for he had to over come lots of problems the hate the way he was going to play jazz were he would play his jazz to start up who could give him a boost or help with the jazz to be known more around him were he would get more new instruments money for a place to keep all his music how would he sell his music and all those problems he had to over come and fix and he still made it to his dream and know he is legend.

In conclusion when there is a problem its good to do your best at it or any problem even if you have more then one problem just over come because in the end it will turn out to be a happy ending.              ",0
"I discovered that the more I was honest about who I was, the easier it was for me to be surrounded by positive individuals who pushed me to reach my goals and dreams. With more experience under my belt, I eventually became better at recognizing bad relationships and toxic people. Trying to fit in and please these people was a mistake, as they only brought me down and it was not the healthy environment that I needed to grow and succeed. From a young age, I learned that if I choose to be truthful and honest, I will likely make wiser decisions in life and build better relationships. 

Throughout my life, I’ve experienced many people who were dishonest and inauthentic. Setting boundaries and not putting up with toxic people is the best way to make wiser, healthier relationships in the long run. 
Growing up, my parents instilled in me at an early age the importance of authenticity and honesty. This made me understand the importance of setting boundaries and being comfortable with saying no - something that is still valuable to me today. We have the ability to choose who we invest our time in, and I have learned that it’s better to choose wisely.. 

Overall, personal growth and development starts with understanding the importance of being honest and authentic in life",1
"Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. . For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why it's a great idea to go and have lots of fun.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world",0
"So, I know there is a country described like that. How warm is it. The Japanese market, the one place I want to go at most in my mind. And they all have their own special places. At this time, the laughing sounds is even louder than morning.

Japan, a such wonderful place, a place that I would like to visit.. Only this image is enough to grab all people's attention from the country. During some special holidays, a bunch of people will came here and participate some small activities which only have at night. The nicest scene is not just that, but also when the night is coming. Many little pinky leafs formed numerous soft and fluffy flowers. In this world has many countries, some are big, some are small. Although some countries are not as that big and not outstanding, but they must have some places that can grab people's attention. With this happy atmosphere, and walk slowly to find out the things you want to buy. And now, just imagine that when all leafs are falling off from the tree, that scene just looks like many butterflies are dancing in the sky. However, the such beautiful scenes in Japan is also the one thing that attracted me. I think that's a such enjoyable thing.

The Japanese foods are also famous. I can't describe it, but I know there is a wonderful place in Japan where can eat a lot of things, and also can buy anything you want. Sometimes just bring your food outside and find a blossom tree, then sit under it, looking at the image while eating. Japan, the one place in the world I would like to visit.

Whenever people mentioned this country, I believe that what they're thinking to are the scenes and foods over there. Everytime, you already can hear the laughing sounds even you're not step in. The blossom tree is the most beautiful image I have been wanted to see from Japan",0
"These activities each offer unique skills and knowledge that could be useful in my future career or educational goals. I will explain the potential benefits, skills and knowledge I hope to gain, and the strategies I will use to manage any potential drawbacks such as time commitments.

Conclusion

That was all my reasons why I disagree what Albert Einstein said. Is there a way for Imagination to help you?

Can Imagination be helpful to you

Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there. Hook

Is it really true that Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Thesis

I honestly disagree with this knowledge is important.

Claims

Knowledge is more important than Imagination.

Can Imagination be helpful to you.

Imagination can happen to some people.

Knowledge is more important that Imagination

Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Say that you just played your new game and you start to imagine in your head how fun the game was ,and what things you did in the game. Lets say you want a snow day you just Imagine its snowing outside but you still have school and theres not really snow there. Knowledge is more important than Imagination, what can Imagination do to help you, Some people can start to Imagine and think that it will help them. Some people do Imagine things but why?

Imagination can happen to someone

A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone. those where my reasons why i disagree.. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head",0

The experience at the doctor's clinic was eye-opening, and I feel more equipped now to pursue my career aspirations in medicine.. Inside, a team of doctors, nurses, and support staff worked in a flurry, gathering supplies and monitoring patient charts. As I watched, I took detailed notes about the doctor's work environment, the materials used, and the decisions they faced. 
As I approached the doctor's clinic, I could feel the buzz of activity. We spoke at length about their experiences in the medical field, and they shared with me some of the challenges and rewards of their job. 

At one point, I received an invitation to observe a real-life operation. I asked questions about the tools they used and the situations they faced on a daily basis, and they provided me with insightful advice for pursuing a career in medicine. I watched as the doctor and staff members interacted, discussing the decisions that had to be made and the treatments that needed to be done.

When it was time for my appointment, the doctor welcomed me warmly into the office. In the operating theater, I witnessed the doctor and nurses in action, and I was struck by their confidence and skill as they operated on the patient",1

One of the best ways to show intelligence is by having a deep understanding of a particular subject matter, through diligently studying and researching facts about that area of expertise. Additionally, someone who is a skilled writer can demonstrate their talent through experiences such as writing short story or articles for publications.

To show off one’s athletic ability, it can be anything that involves physical strength, flexibility and endurance. Being able to explain why these skills have been developed, such as growing up in a particular environment or actively seeking out related opportunities gives it more credibility. This could include being able to memorize an entire text book on a certain subject, or being able to make a beautiful painting in a short amount of time. An additional way to show intelligence is working out puzzles and strategies for problem-solving, such as creating a spreadsheet or other type of presentation to explain complex concepts.

To show off talents, it can include skills in music, art, writing, and other creative talents. 

Overall, many unique skills across different areas such as intelligence, talent and athletic abilities, all lend to a person’s individual identity. Reflecting on how you have been able to develop these skills and demonstrating how they are unique from others is a great way to prove to the world that you possess a special and rare combination of attributes.. Being able to show how they achieve higher endurance by continually increasing times for running a certain distance or being able to lift heavier weights are both ways to show athletic abilities.

The key to each of these skills is to demonstrate the qualities that make them unique. For example, if someone is good at playing the guitar and participating in choirs, that is one way to demonstrate their talent. As an example, for someone who wants to show off their athletic ability, they could demonstrate things such as running, weightlifting or playing a sport",1
"Dear Principal

I don't agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I hope that you will change your mind after reading this note.

Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME. I think that students needs exercise. There are lots of reasons why students shouldn't have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress.

If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment's in school. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future.

Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. I am also a sports fan my myself. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything.

If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. I know how it feels if that happens to me.

I wouldn't like it if I have to worry about my school work and my favorite sport. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. Changing school policy is a bad idea.

I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school",0
"For example, when you are in high school you need to take your time and investigate patiently what careers are more availables for you, you need to concentrated on what you are interested becauase everyone have differents aspirations and differents visions of life.

However, not everyone agree with this position some people claim that choose a career at a young age can be beneficial for the students because that way you have an expecific goal and you can focus more in what you need. Students changed their aspirations because over the time they can find out new abilities and differents skills.. Nevertheles the opposition overlooks an important point is you do not have enough time to think about new options, over the time students gets new skills and you have to be sure about what you really want

One most clonclude, commit a cereer at a young age is not a good idea because you do not have enough time to think about new options, over the time students gets new skills and you have to be sure about what you really want. For example, some schools offer to you a tutor and they help you to decided based on your interests and they recommended have differents options and spend a lot of time thinking about what is more covinient for you.

Secondly, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you do not have enough time to think about new options. Is a good idea for students to commit a cereer at a young age? Some peple believe that choose a career at a young age can be beneficial for the students while other people believe choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big responsibility, you do not have enough time to think about new options, over the time students gets new skills and you have to be sure about what you really want. This is important because it is not easy for students have expecifics aspirations and good options of careers at a young age.

First, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you have to be sure about what you really want, you have to inform you about others posibilities, you need to know what are the benefits that some careers offer to you",0
"The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things. Even though, that people had adversities they always had a positive attitude towards the problems, that hope they needed to become someone. The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude.

It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, in the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities"", many people had a hard time before becoming successful. People with a good attitude do not give up when facing problems. The importance of having a positive attitude can be bigger of what some people may think. To be positive in life is really important, since it helps people to face problems and become successful. To see the good side of the things in life help to be successful. When people have a good attitude toward a problem, to face it becomes easier since people will look for a solution instead of being stuck. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life.

Many people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. Having a good attitude help people to not give up when facing adversities.

Furthermore, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier.               . Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life.

To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through. A positive attitude describes how much effort people are putting into the problems they are facing. A positive attitude can change the view of the problems. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. Having a good attitude, will make things easier to go through. For example, a person with a positive attitude will always see the good side of the problems. Some people may say that a positive attitude is not always needed to become successful, however a positive attitude is the key to success in life. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because a positive attitude will help not to give up and will make things easier.

Physical activity is vital for overall wellbeing. With regular practice, we can reap the many rewards increased physical and mental health, better problem solving, and enhanced self-expression.. Not only can they be incredibly fulfilling and enjoyable activities, they also offer substantial health benefits and allow for meaningful self-expression. Sports help maintain strong bones and muscles, reduce the risk of health issues like obesity, and provide necessary stress relief. 
Playing sports and music have long been universal sources of joy and entertainment. In addition, playing a sport can help develop problem solving and leadership skills.

Writing and performing music also provide numerous benefits. Through music we can explore inner realms of our psyche and express our true selves in ways that can’t be done with words. Learning an instrument can boost creativity and improve cognitive skills.

"This showed that depending on the type of liquid, different colors could be observed when a light is shone onto it.. We examined the heart rate of the frog before and after stimulation of its legs with a paintbrush. This gives evidence to show that the movements of the legs are related to stimulation of the heart.

The second experiment involved using a flashlight and a liquid. 
The first experiment was conducted on the interior of a frog. When the flashlight was shone onto the liquid, the liquid glowed in a specific color. This was because the liquid had a property called fluorescence which made it glow in response to the light. We found that the heart rate of the frog increased once stimulation was applied",1
"People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

Being a failure is not bad. To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. A failure is what makes us strong and successful we just have to give that failure enthusiasim to keep trying and to succeed.. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.

Playing a sport is not easy. I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying.

Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up",0
"On the positive side, students may have more opportunities to engage with their coursework in-depth and get more out of their educational experience. 
Adding one and a half extra hours to the school day for students could have a vast range of consequences, both positive and negative. Furthermore, it may create additional financial burdens as students would need to pay for childcare for any siblings they may have. It could also give them more time to participate in extracurricular activities and develop new skills. It could also discourage them from joining extracurricular activities by reducing the amount of time they have available to participate. Ultimately, the potential consequences of adding one and a half extra hours to the school day for students are far-reaching and should be carefully considered.. On the negative side, it could increase the amount of stress students face and lead to higher levels of fatigue and burnout",1
"He weighed out all his options and, after carefully considering all sides of the decision, Joe made the best choice he could..

After careful research of the options available to reach his desired goal, Joe was still uncertain",1
"Going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm can help be successful in the end because you tried and tried again and it gave you more confidence to go on and try things you haven't done before. Going to the next level is a big thing in life good things start coming your way and more people start to like you because of the challenges you went through and failing helped you become successful at the end of those challenges.

I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it can help us in life and in the future.. Giving up ruins your life.

In life there will be challenges coming your way and you should take those challenges head on and if you fail try again and be successful, because out of those challenges comes a great price that takes you to the next level. When we fail we learn from our mistakes and try again and be successful because failure is actually helping you in the pursuit of success.

On the pursuit of success we will have some hard times ahead of us, and does hard time are the mistakes we will end up making and form does mistakes comes success. Once again giving up is not an option in the book of life. Failure helps thousands of people become successful in life.

When you are trying something new, you have to happy about it, and when you fail doing that new thing you should still be happy because it is your first time doing it, and when you fail you always get a second chance to do it again, and when you fail the second time you get another chance, it will keep going until you get it at the end and giving up is not an option. But for other people it takes the a few times before they can get it, that is going from failure to failure. And when you try new thing and you fail and you give up strait away you, are not being successful, you are just ruining your life an becoming a failure because you gave up strait away. You should always be happy about trying new things. I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it is true. For some people when they try new things the only get it once without any mistakes",0
"Despite the fact that I worked extremely hard to gain their trust and admiration, I found that it was a losing battle due to my poor first impression. Despite our best efforts, those who make an unimpressive first impression often find that subsequent efforts to shake the initial perception are simply not enough. As a freshman in high school, I was excited to join the basketball team. At first, I couldn’t understand why they were so skeptical about me, but then I realized that my reputation was based on a poor first impression. 
First impressions can have a lasting impact, and in many instances they are almost impossible to change. 

To illustrate the effects of first impressions, I’ll use an example from my own life. Upon entering the gym for the team’s first practice, I was surprised to find that I already had a negative reputation among some of my teammates. As a result, first impressions can shape our future interactions and experiences with them. Unbeknownst to me, my teammates had already judged me based on my physical appearance and the fact that I was new to the team. This is because we tend to use first impressions as benchmarks in forming an opinion about someone or something. As a result, first impressions can have a lasting impact and it’s important to make a good one when you meet someone for the first time.. 

These experiences have taught me that first impressions are almost impossible to change",1
"It is not a good idea that the students commit to a career at a young age, because it will be to complicataed and difficult for them to take high school classes and their college classes at the same time , however if their high school are select to guide them toward a specif careeer let them take similar classes for example first week high school classes, and second week college classes that way they will not struggle in both differents courses and they can graduate with good grades . Also, it would be a good opportunitie for them to get done their career at a young age and start making money from what they are apassionated on it farthermore, some young people are interest in work on what they like and this could be a great apportunitie for them to commit to a career and start workin on what they have been apassionated on it and get a job that it would be able to made their families proud of them.

Commit a career at a young age give people the responsability to help their families and support them and with the time people at a young a age get more mature in life ,inorder for people to have a great future in life they should take their own responsabilities and learn from their mistake and with the past of time people learn how important life it's ;while people are gettting more elavate then others peple start to descriminate others who are down don't let people wash your head

,always be you because ,today you are up and tomorrow no body no it don't let appearance cheat on you.

Parents have to give support their child with the decision to commit a careeer at a young age, because that's what they want; don't be desagree with them because the only thing that they want is to be independent and lot of mothers don't let their childs be an adult; farthermore, mother's have to impulse their child to make their own decisions and let them learn from their mistakes.

If their sons/daughters go to work or finish their careers far away from their homes it will hurt to their families, understand they're been more adults them your litles baby's no more it doesn't matter if they are your adorations let them be free.

In conclusion,people are allow to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes and next time they can make better decisions to allow them to choose the better opportunities people put on their life inorder to know what's right and wrong and wich make them to be more responsibles and mature in life.

Many have come to realize that life doesn't always is pink color ,people have to make their best effort doesn't mater if you fall down or make mistakes ,wake up and do it again until you do it right.",0

Online education has grown rapidly over the past decade, providing convenient and flexible opportunities for students to learn. Additionally, remote learning can ensure that students are not disadvantaged by weather-related cancellations, minimizing disruptions to schooling. As such, it is important to weigh all potential factors before deciding between an online or in-person learning environment.

All in all, online education can meet a variety of needs, often allowing students to learn in a more flexible manner that suits their individual needs. By taking into account the diverse needs of students, educators can take advantage of online education to make up for missed school days due to personal, health, or sports considerations. That said, online education can be lonely and isolating, as students miss out on conversations and collaborations with their peers. Furthermore, online learning can be less distracting, as students have more control over their environment. With careful consideration of time management, distractions, and potential isolation, remote learning can be advantageous for students with missed school days or weather-related interruptions.. Time management is an important factor to consider; in online classrooms, students are often responsible for establishing their own study time, whereas an instructor can structure a traditional classroom to ensure that learning time is used efficiently. 

In-person and online classrooms offer their own unique advantages and disadvantages",1
"
Mentoring programs that pair older and younger students come with many benefits. Firstly, older students can use their knowledge to help their younger colleagues, as they will likely have more experience and insights to share. For example, an older student may be able to provide an inside view of a college or offer tips on applying for scholarships. In addition, the younger students can act as mentors of their own in terms of their grasp of technology, familiarity with digital media, and the latest trends in youth culture. Finally, the overall collaboration between the two ages can bridge the gap in knowledge and experience, creating an open and symbiotic atmosphere of learning.",1
"She reminded me to never give up and to keep pushing through, even when faced with uncertainty.

The wisdom my aunt has shared with me has been integral in how I live my life. Her support has helped me find my own inner strength, as I have come to the realization that it is alright to make mistakes. 
My aunt has always been a crucial part of my life. Ultimately, her guidance has been invaluable to my formation as an individual, and I am grateful for all of the life lessons she has given me.. Growing up, she was the first to tell me never to give up and to remember that it is ok to make mistakes. I often reflect on her words of advice; particularly when I am in the process of making a decision. She told me to just take things one step at a time and to remember that the choices I make do not have to be permanent. From an early age, her words of wisdom and years of experience have shaped the way I look at the world and how I make decisions. With her sage advice, she taught me that mistakes give you the opportunity to grow and to learn.

One of the most vivid examples of her advice was when I started to become overwhelmed with all of the opportunities in front of me when studying for college",1
"This allows me to make choices that are best suited for my individual circumstances and beliefs.

In conclusion, it is far better to make your own decisions in life rather than seeking guidance from experts or authorities. Taking control of my decisions has allowed me to learn and grow far more than any external expert or authority ever could. This gave me the opportunity to explore and learn independently, expanding my knowledge well beyond the preconceived ideas of a single person.

Another example of why it’s best to make my own decisions can be found in my career. 
Making my own decisions has proven to be an incredibly beneficial choice in my life. 

For example, when I was deciding what college to attend, I chose to ignore the advice of my high school guidance counselor and followed my own instincts. I did my own research and compared the various programs available to me, ultimately choosing a college that was different from the one recommended to me. Rather than trying to follow a predetermined path proposed by someone else, I chose to make my own decisions about what job I wanted. For instance, when it comes to matters of health and wellbeing, I like to do my own research and make decisions that are based on my own understanding of my body and needs. This enabled me to explore opportunities that I otherwise wouldn’t have been aware of and ultimately led me to a field that I am passionate about and enjoy working in.

Finally, when it comes to important life decisions, I prefer to make my own decisions rather than following the advice of authority figures. Making my own decisions has allowed me to learn, grow, and make choices that reflect my personal beliefs and individual needs.",1
"Instead of languishing in the hypothetical, you can take concrete steps toward making your goals a reality. 
Taking action rather than being a passive dreamer has three key advantages: 

First, taking action will make your dreams more achievable. With each new action you take, you’ll find yourself closer to your goal. For example, if you’re trying to launch a project, you can take action by joining relevant Facebook groups, attending local meetups, and actively engaging with potential collaborators.

By taking action as opposed to just dreaming, you can make your goals more achievable, gain momentum, and build meaningful connections - three clear reasons to take action rather than remain inactive.. For example, if you’re starting a business, you might take action by researching potential markets, writing a business plan, and creating a website.

Lastly, taking action can help you make meaningful connections. When you take one step, it’s easier to take the next. Taking actions in pursuit of a goal can open you up to new relationships and collaborations. For example, if you want to get a new job, you can take action by researching companies in your industry, updating your resume, and attending networking events.

Second, taking action helps you gain momentum",1
"

The key to maintaining enthusiasm throughout this process is to remain optimistic and focus on our progress. 
The renowned British statesman Winston Churchill once famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” His words express a powerful idea: that failure is essential for success. With each failure, we gain more experience and knowledge which can be used on our journey to success. 

Winston Churchill’s quote encapsulates the idea that it is possible to utilize failure to propel us towards our desired outcomes. Viewing failure in a positive light allows us to stay motivated and benefit from the lessons learned. By keeping our enthusiasm alive and staying optimistic, we set ourselves up for achieving our greatest successes.. In order for us to reach our goals, it is inevitable that we will experience failure along the way. We should use this knowledge to help power us towards our ultimate goals. Having a strong mindset and the right attitude can be the difference between succeeding and throwing in the towel. This notion is particularly relevant in our modern lives, where every day we set ourselves goals and strive for success in all aspects of our lives. This should be embraced, rather than feared, as failure often gives us insight and teaches us valuable lessons",1
"It can bring optimism and clarity of thought, making it much easier to be successful in the long run.. 
Having a positive attitude is a powerful tool that can bring construction and happiness to one's life. The attitude can be contagious and spread to those in one's family, friend and work circles, creating a cheerful environment and an outlet to become successful. It is also important to take responsibility for one's actions and to look at both sides of a situation to try and consider the other person's perspective. Having a positive attitude is vital when seeking to achieve success because it allows a person to have a constructive outlook and positive energy to motivate them to reach their goals",1

Lastly, introducing new foods or changing the menu could cause disruption or even dissatisfaction among students. This could potentially lead to diminished morale and a less positive school environment. 

One outcome could be that students may be less likely to eat the food offered if they are not accustomed to the new items. If students don't eat the food served in the cafeteria, they may not be getting the proper nutrition they need throughout the day. Food that is low in nutrition and high in unhealthy ingredients can not only be detrimental to physical health, but can also impact students' mental health and wellbeing. While this can be a good way to cut costs, there are also potential negative outcomes to consider. 

In conclusion, before making any changes to cafeteria food, school administrators must weigh the potential positives against the potential negatives.. Furthermore, if students are not fully nourished, it could potentially lead to poorer academic performance.

Another potential outcome is that the quality of the food offered may decrease, leading to unhealthy eating habits. 
As school budgets are stretched, some schools are considering changes to the food offered in cafeterias",1
"Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes.

In conclusion setting examples by your own behavior to influence others is a smart thing to do and you'll be surprised by how many people youv'e influenced.             . In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example.

My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it.

There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. Setting examples by your own behavior to influence other people is better for many reasons but still has its pros and cons.

My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on",0
"Furthermore, it also gives parents peace of mind knowing that their children are safe and not engaging in potentially dangerous activities. It can help reduce crime and keep the public safe, as well as offer economic benefits to cities. 

Overall, implementing a curfew for teenagers can be beneficial for many reasons. By reducing the amount of criminal activity in public spaces, it can help create a better and safer environment, which creates a better quality of life for citizens. 

Admittedly, there are some drawbacks to implementing a curfew, such as potentially infringing on the rights of young people by preventing them from participating in certain activities. 
Implementing a curfew for teenagers can have a positive impact on crime rates and public safety in cities. To counter this, cities could offer alternative activities geared towards teenagers and create a safe environment for them to congregate. By requiring teenagers to be home at certain times, it eliminates potential opportunities for crime, especially among young people. 

Creating a curfew also has economic benefits. Studies show that curfews can help reduce the amount of criminal activity that occurs late at night. However, cities should also strive to create safe and engaging activities for teenagers and provide them with opportunities to stay out of trouble.. Additionally, this can also boost local businesses who may suffer from broken windows and loitering",1
"Anyway, what informato can give us technology in our entire life. Every one knows that without technology life is hard but, if we have to save our health aslo. is part of technology to help people contact with each other and we should have limitation of contact to using these techonlogy when we need , we can use technology.

"Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". To see someone impression, that might be possible to chang. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. So to see people impression we have to see thier past and what they been throw, Many of them change there mood, and some might change after a prolem has been solved.. People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think",0
"Writers, artists, fashion designers, singers, and photographers are just a few examples of roles in which one must use their creative skills and imaginations. Musician Kendrick Lamar utilized his rap skills to tell creative stories and deliver unique messages.

Creative thinking and the ability to imagine is not only important in the workplace but also in everyday life. Common skills associated with these creative roles are artistic vision, storytelling abilities, musical flair, understanding of color, and the ability to craft unique ideas. 
Using imagination and creativity is incredibly useful and important in many jobs and fields. Everyone has the potential to use their imagination and creativity - the only limit is your own mind.. For instance, fashion designer Diane Von Fürstenberg used her imagination and creative vision to dress and redefine women's wardrobes with her signature wrap-dress. One way to use imagination and creativity in everyday life is to approach a problem from a new perspective. For example, if something isn't working, think of creative solutions that could help overcome any challenges. Imagination and creativity can also be used to explore new hobbies or interests, such as painting a picture or creating a DIY project",1
"Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. I've always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it. It helped me learn to be competitive because it's a competition in the real world. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. In the future, I hope that one day I will win a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life.

""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. It also sounds great when you get paid to do something you love like competing in tournaments. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament.

""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. If I can buy those then I won't have to have help from my family. Even if we've gotten tired of doing other activities together, we've never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. ""Super Smash Brothers"" brings others closer together with their families and friends.. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. I learned that doing activities are never as fun when you're doing it alone. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others.

My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. If you don't get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldn't do that thing again for a while. I know that I can't just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more",0
"Thomas Jefferson was one of the most driven historical figures of our time, and he never shied away from a challenge. His philosophy to accomplishment was simple yet effective; set a goal, plan out the steps it would take to reach that goal, and relentlessly pursue it until success was achieved. He recognized that obstacles were inevitable and that the path toward success might be a long and marked with pitfalls, but he persevered until he accomplished his goals.

Today there are various strategies that we can use to effectively accomplish a goal, such as breaking it down into manageable steps, identifying realistic deadlines, and staying motivated by celebrating small milestones along the way. My essay will ultimately emphasize the courage and drive that it takes to accomplish goals and ultimately capture success.. I will use multiple sources to illustrate the potential success stories, while also discussing potential obstacles and how to handle them. It is proof that anything is possible if we set our minds to it.

In drafting an outline for my essay, I will focus on how to best accomplish goals as well as why it is important to stay motivated. However, it is possible to overcome any obstacle if we are persistent and remain positive.

To illustrate the potential for success, there are countless success stories of people who have managed to accomplish difficult goals. There will always be challenges that stand in our way, such as large workloads, financial barriers, and lack of time. 
When attempting to achieve a goal, most of us are motivated by personal success and the fulfillment of our ambitions. From completing college while facing financial hardship to earning a six-figure salary, these stories can provide inspiration and fuel our ambition",1
"Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day",0
"Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. He said ""Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill."" That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it."" I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. I had my license and my life was going go too.

To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. So I study hard and where i'm I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I don't mess up again. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I can't drive. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. Life dosen't work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I won't do that chemical bond ever again.""

Often successes can help both young and older student. We both learn a lesson that nobody is perfect the first time. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again? . I over did with the salt a little bit. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you don't know something don't leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist won't be there all ways. ""Aww man, I **** hate this, I don't know how to make this spaghetti and meatball sandwich I had the wheat bread, the sauce, manssreala cheese, spaghetti and my meatballs what else in this world am I missing. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I don't pass then I don't ever get my license even when I really old. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created. Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on.

Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal",0
"Many time they need to work on summer and this affect most students, they going the school in the morning and the night they work. Also they need to make the work of the all classes because that importan, and all classes they need for graduate. most of them have many homework and they not finish on time because they are tired and need to sleep to going with energy on the school though they are not finish the homework. Nevertheless is it not a good idea for students, because they tired more early, bring more focus on some classes but not in the others, and they not take a break on summer.

They can be tired more early because some time they worry for the work that they have . Nevertheless the grades can be going down for the reasons that the students not put attention on classes, or not make the work. Althogh some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Clearly the students forget the importan that all classes are for graduate.

The students not take a break on summer because they want to going the summer school for make more classes. In concept the students need more time to make the school work because if they take the offer to graduate in three years they need to give everything on time.

Most of them bring more focus on some classes that others because they think that some classes are more important and the others not. The students can be tired because they want to make the more importans classes, but this is more hard. some families going anothers countries for vacation and the students can not going for the reason that they need to stick for study. . For example, students pass more time study and not take a break. For example, they make this for graduate more early but, they do not have time for they family or for the work. Clearly going on summer school affect students but, this can be help for advance classes.

In conclution some school help students to graduate more early like in three years. Most of them need to going on summer school because they need to pass the classes. For all students the graduate is it importans, but everyone need to take the time in the school an have good grades when they are ready to graduate this is more importan. They bring more focus in the importants classes and the others classes not. This can be give them problems if they not make anything for they grades going up because if they have bad grades they can not graduate in three years. Most students going to school sleep because in the night they study for exams, or make some proyect that they left",0
"
First impressions are very important as they shape an idea of who someone is and who they are likely to be in the future. I immediately felt out of place and my discomfort was evident in my interactions with them. If I had made a more positive first impression, I strongly believe that the rest of the semester would have gone much smoother.. As I walked into my first class, I was met with skeptical glares and glances from some of my classmates. As time went on, my classmates started to warm up to me and show interest in getting to know me, but the initial impression I made made it more difficult to build a connection with them. I have experienced this firsthand during my first year of university",1
"In order to truly lead a fulfilled life, it is necessary to be willing to take risks, be open to new experiences, and try the things that challenge us. Doing so will yield tremendous rewards, both personally and professionally. After rising up from an impoverished childhood, Oprah created an entire media empire despite not having any previous experience in the television and film industries. 

Another example of taking a leap of faith outside of one’s comfort zone is drawn from my own personal experience. She took a risk, believed in her dreams, and ended up creating history with her tremendous success. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote that, ""Life is a journey, not a destination."" This simple statement succinctly captures the importance of exploring beyond our comfort zones. However, once I made the conscious effort to step out of my comfort zone, I have achieved more confidence and have gone on to accomplish some of my biggest life goals. When I was younger, I was incredibly shy and introverted and was always nervous and afraid to try new things. As Emerson said, “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.” Exploring beyond our comfort zones will always lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our world.. 

Ultimately, the best approach is to embrace the idea of continuing to explore and push limits. 

One great example of a person who stepped outside of their comfort zone and achieved amazing success is Oprah Winfrey",1
"Students can fail a test over and over again but whiles he's failing hes learning from his mistakes to pass his test.

Working on something new or getting used to something new,you wont get it right the first time you would mess up or fail but once you keep getting used to it you learn from your mistake which helps you to become successful.

If you ask most successful people of today,some might respond by saying they experienced alot of failure on the way to the top some might respond with a no,this states that failure might plays a role in being successful it may also not play a role in being successful. A scientist can start an experiment and fail over and over again till they get they expected the results. Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm? its a 50% chance you will be successful,reason for this is that some people give up too easily,some people get tired of failing and failing again. . You dont need to fail many times before you get successful.

Some people never put in work to be successful as they are today some just became successful out the cut. Right now the world we live in you dont really need to put in alot of effort,there are many ways of being successful for example we have social media! Social media now has a big impact in the world we live in.

Scientists are perfect examples of this statement",0
"People need to believe in themselves, stay dedicated to their goals and be passionate about what they do in order to be successful. Failing to learn from mistakes can have disastrous consequences, as people are prone to repeat them and make the same mistakes over and over again, thus preventing them from achieving the success they desire. Learning from mistakes is also an important factor in order to succeed; People should be willing to reflect on their mistakes and figure out what they could have done differently in order to improve. In conclusion, it is essential to understand the meaning behind Winston Churchill's famous quote, and should carry motivation and dedication in order to be successful, as well as learning from one's mistakes in order to prevent failure in the future.. Winston Churchill famously said that “success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm”, and it is important to understand the meaning behind this statement if we wish to be successful in life. Encouragement and motivation are essential in order to achieve success in life. 
    Success is often a result of failing multiple times—but never losing motivation or enthusiasm in the process",1
"In family life, collective decisions that take others into consideration tend to create an atmosphere of unity and understanding. It is clear that cooperation, teamwork, and consideration for others contribute to success in nearly all contexts.. In the workplace, colleagues who work together effectively and demonstrate consideration for each other tend to be more successful than those who go at it alone. 
Collaboration, team-work, and being considerate of others have been proven to shape success in various contexts. Finally, in social relationships, collaboration and consideration can lead to long lasting connections and positive interactions. In school, working with peers on projects and recognizing individual strengths and weaknesses can result in enhanced academic performance",1
"While learning about music, drama, and art can be enjoyable, they are not always the most important classes for students to take.

In conclusion, music, drama, and art classes should not be required, and should instead be offered as electives. It can be argued that these classes should be electives rather than required courses.

First, in many cases these classes can be pointless for some students. 
Music, drama, and art classes have long been required in many schools, but it is worth questioning whether these are essential courses for students to take. For some, these classes can become a chore and not a source of joy or learning.

Second, music, drama, and art classes can be unfair for students with different abilities. Many creative subjects necessitate creativity, skill, and/or talent to excel, something which not all students have. Forcing less-able students to take these classes can result in them feeling isolated and unable to keep up with their peers.

Finally, these classes are not always necessary when it comes to achieving education goals. For instance, a student who does not have an inclination or desire to learn an instrument or create art may go through the motions without actually absorbing the material or making any real progress. These classes can be irrelevant or difficult for some students, and are not always the most important when it comes to pursuing an education.. Classes such as English, Math, and Science are vital in order to acquire qualifications and pass standardized tests, which can lead to future career opportunities",1
". If we are always doing something we get things done faster and there is possiblilities of starting new things. Sometimes we over thinks that aren't that big of a deal and a big part of it comes from not taking the time to rest and refresh our memories. Woring all the time can exshuased ours bodys and make us think a little less. Why should we wait to finish something we can finish the same day, we never know what can happen. With a fresh mind set it can make things easier than we thought. We can perfect things we didnt think we could. I believe Thomas Jefferson is right. Maybe taking a break can refresh are memories and remind us how important things are to us. It can give a chance to see different views of are own ideas. I also believe the inactivity is good not only does it give a chance to rest but we also can think through our ideas. Many people would agree with Thomas Jefferson just like I do but would also agree that taking time to rest is also getting things done",0
"You may miss out on trying new activities and exploring different paths. Furthermore, you may change your mind as you get older and find it harder to adjust to a different career. However, committing to a career too early can be detrimental to personal growth. Young people tend to be particularly energetic and motivated and so can focus on their career ambitions early on. 
Committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and drawbacks. On the positive side, an early commitment can help to focus your education and give you an impetus to work hard towards your chosen goal. Therefore, committing to a career at a young age can be a substantial decision and it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons.",1
"Indeed, these are the components required to achieve any goal, no matter the size or scope. To put it simply, results can only come from consistent action over an extended period of time. 

If one chooses to be idle, then they are likely to idle away the days in procrastination and avoidance. With consistent effort, one can create a lasting legacy and memorable impact on the world.

Persistence, hard work, and determination are the hallmarks of successful people. Consistent action does not merely mean physical action. A well-defined plan plus consistent implementation is the means by which dreams are actualized. Instead, they will make use of time, using it to hone their skills and work towards the life they hope to build. 
Thomas Jefferson once declared that “Determine never to be idle. It covers devising plans, laying foundations, and dedicating time and energy to a specific goal. 

By adhering to Thomas Jefferson’s quote and being proactive rather than reactive, a person stands the best chance of succeeding. The process may be lengthy and laborious, but the rewards are well worth the effort.. But those who understand the importance of hard work and determination will not sit by and allow life to simply pass them by. Making the decision to “never be idle” takes courage, resolve, and dedication, yet they are essential to progress. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.” His words illustrate the concept that taking consistent action can be rewarding in prodigious ways",1
"I definitely think that programs make a positive input in these helping young life.

'. I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age.

My first response is some children can commit to a career at a young age, if they want to improve and they want a good future, they have to go to school and many of children can helped from their parents.

For example; if someone want a career at young age they have to work hard, and pay attention, some time is going to be difficult for them but they can do it.

Children engage in a career at a young age to prepare themselves for their future .

Also, is a good idea for students to a career at a young age because they are improve in a good age and they thinking about their future, but in a career at young age some children want to graduated at a young age, first they have to work hard at school, and there are many way, and programs to be graduated from Hig School for a career at a young age.

In conclusion, kids who take advantage of programs, and High Schools, are qualifying these students for their lives ahead in order to have a good future with a career they want",0
"To embrace the positivity potential within ourselves and our experiences is to open ourselves up to the possibility of a life full of growth and accomplishment.. Positive thinking can help us look at problems from a different perspective and push us to pursue solutions. 
It is often said that attitude is everything, and this is especially true when it comes to success in life. Striving for success is so much easier when we’re not constantly putting ourselves down and expecting failure.

Ultimately, choosing to maintain a positive attitude is one of the most important steps we can take towards a successful life. Knowing that we can take on challenges, that we can push our limits and still come out on top, is a powerfuliumph of positivityhedge courage in our own capabilities and can be hugely motivational. Positive thinking has been proven time and time again to be a key component of achieving both short-term and long-term successes, from more mundane everyday accomplishments to reaching our biggest dreams. This can have a profound impact on our mental health and the ability to cope with challenging situations. Positive thinking is the practice of choosing to focus on the good rather than the bad in any situation and thereby engage with life more positively and productively.

When we choose to focus on the good in a situation, our stress and anxiety levels tend to decrease. This can also increase our emotional intelligence, which in turn can lead to better communication and relationships with those around us.

Furthermore, positive thinking can bolster our self-confidence and encourage us to pursue opportunities for growth and advancement",1
"He states that ""incessant execution of labor is the only proof of our existence, and, as long as we are executing, we cease to be mere shadows, and become real and living things.” 

Jefferson's perspective can be applied to the world today by valuing effort and dedication. While hard work and dedication may not always have an immediate reward, in the long run they enable us to lead more fulfilling lives and excel in whatever challenge we face.. 
In his essay 'On Motion and Merit', Thomas Jefferson argues that we should embrace labor and constant movement in order to live our most fulfilling lives. For example, when studying for a degree or preparing for a job interview, the amount of effort and dedication a person puts into their task will be reflected in the results. The same principle can be applied to any challenge; those who strive to excel and devote themselves to their tasks will be rewarded with greater satisfaction and personal growth.

In conclusion, Jefferson's views on constant work and motion can be applicable to the world today. In the modern era, hard work is often a key factor in finding success and achieving individual goals. He believes that it is excellence, rather than idleness or comfort that create true happiness",1
"They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. Life doesn't for that way. Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school.. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want",0
"Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team.

Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.

To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone. For instance, working in group gives more ideas from different people's sense of humor and people get chance to work with different people whose thoughts and working style is different.   . Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless",0
"I think and i think i speak for the whole school we at least should have a D average because if you really want to play in a sport or do an activity you should keep your grades up above an F that way you passing you class or classes but you also know that its not all fun and games you have to do your studies first in order to be in any type of activity and if you do good in school you can accomplish anything in life. Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I know that us student are responsible for our grades in school but a B average just to play sports or be i some sort of activity is pretty dumb most students have C averages if you change this policy you will have lots of mad parents or students i think you don't want to be the bad guy here. I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport but you have to like its because it keeps you out of trouble well its true i mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community.",0
"Focusing on a future career endeavor gives them the motivation they need to aim for higher goals, challenge themselves academically and learn skills that will be beneficial to them in their future careers. By running career paths by friends, teachers or mentors they can gain helpful advice as to what paths might best lead to their aspirations.

Anxiety about the future may lead to procrastination, but planning for a future career is an essential part of being a high school student. Thinking about their future career gives students the motivation they need to stay engaged and focus on their academic goals. For these reasons it is important for high school students to start thinking about their future career.. It is less about knowing exactly what you want to do and more about setting a goal. 
The world of work is constantly changing, and uncertain job markets can make it intimidating for high school students to even think about their future. It can also provide clarity regarding their educational options and create opportunities for advice from teachers, mentors or peers. Planning for a future career helps students to stay motivated and focused in their academic pursuits.

When high school students are thinking about their future careers they become more engaged and invested in their academic studies. Knowing that they are working towards a specific goal that they are passionate about is what regularly drives students to excel in their classes.

Considering their future career can also provide a better understanding of their educational options. Despite the anxiety, it is important for high school students to begin investing in their future career. Young people are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available, but articulating the path they want to pursue after high school can make it easier to decide what type of school to attend or even whether to attend college at all",1
"And one day I asked one of my friend what you did to be successful in your life. So another attack of failure in my way, I did not no how to study because there was no one to help me what should I do in that time so fall at school. They were making fun of me when I spook English. All my families were worry about me. like when I came America with zero English that was the biggest straggle in my counsel. From experince , I'm saying yes that the failure makes my life better. Former British Prime Mrimister Winston Churchill once said that ''success consists of going failure to failure loss of enthusiasm. Use reasons and specific examples to support your ideas.

Yes I agree.

The Failure in My life.

The failure in the life is just the first step of counsel to success. That word change my life to think positive. Because I do not what let other people make decision of what should I do or not.

Self development

Third was to wake to believe of myself and to make nay decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                . As human we can learn anyn things that we thought that is hard to learn it. But that never stop me from what I want to do. Nothing can make me stay a way from what make me successful.

And the end, as human our enthusiasm can make us stronger then failure. there were a lot of pressure no me . We have to look what other people did in the life because of enthusiasm. Because of what other people were saying about me like that impossible that you can go further than that you are now which is can not get high school diploma there were a lot of failure in my life .From failure to a big surprise that I making this year, I will be my graduation form high school and the nest will be collage. I did not let the language or anythings else to stop me back from what would me my life best.

School and Study .

Second , as student that was the hardest than that I though . ''she said be yourself and if you are important to yourself that will makes it different''. I could not focus with what I was doing like school and work and other thing because of people around me. Now I'm a superior in the pace I work for it. So way where was applying for jobs the company require have whether Spinsh or English so I can not speak any of other, for tow year I was just home, job no money to help my family back home because of language

But I did not stop after two years fund a job so I was dishwasher, it was too tough to communicate with my Mangers and employees too. So over and over I fall of everything. No back round of school like knowledge or education because I never been in the school in my childhood so that made it for me so difficult to understand what the teachers were saying. I could not eat well for two years and I got sick. ""Do you agree with of Churchil's statment about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success ? Take a position on this question.

"Parents also benefit from online classes by having more time to participate and be involved in their child's education. 

A successful example of online and video conferencing classes can be seen in the South Korean education system. Teachers, on the other hand, benefit from having easier access to students in different parts of the world, allowing them to teach at a larger scale. South Korea managed to not only transition classes to the digital format quickly, but also help prevent the spread of the virus while still providing students with quality education. For students, online learning environments provide a more flexible and comfortable learning atmosphere, which can reduce the stress of commuting to school. 
Attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing has been of great benefit to students, parents, and teachers during the pandemic. After the pandemic caused physical classes to shut down last year, online and video conferencing classes were quickly implemented - and were very successful. This paved the way for other countries to adopt similar measures, proving that online or video conferencing classes can be very successful.",1
"From there, it is necessary to explore education requirements for the chosen career path. Researching career paths from a young age is essential, as it carries the potential to shape and direct students’ futures in a meaningful way.. For some students, choosing a career at young age can provide focus and a goal to work towards. Additionally, it can be especially detrimental if students are forced into certain career paths without having the opportunity to explore their own interests. 
Taking the first step in identifying a career path can be a daunting task, especially for young people. It is important that the direction reflects the unique interests and talents of the student. But it can also limit students' flexibility in the long run, as changes in interest can be difficult to pursue. It's important to understand the potential negative effects of taking such a route",1
"It is our job to be confident in our own abilities and to know that our paths are unique to us. 
It is important to always be yourself and never let others influence who you are. Being yourself will lead to growth, greater self-awareness, and the confidence to truly stand out and make your own mark in the world. We each have our own gifts and talents that we should be proud of. 

A great real-life example of this is Ariana Grande. When we give in to the opinions and pressures of others, we are not being true to ourselves. So never give up, never lose sight of who you are, and always remember to be yourself.. She was true to herself, her sound, and her style, staying true to the core of what makes her unique and is now one of the most successful singers of our time. 

It is also important to remember that life will have its difficult days, but if you remain confident in your abilities and keep yourself true to who you are, you can push through anything. She did not let the pressure of the music industry shape her talent or who she is as a person",1
"The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it. I am agree with the Emerson's statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. . And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself.

it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone.

I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly.

Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong.

Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement",0
"All in all, by doing your research and taking the time to consider your plan for the future, you can be well on your way to acquiring the job you intended to work for.. Knowing the pros and cons of these great programs can help us better decide if they are right for us.

We can also look to many successful people for guidance and motivation when trying to reach our career goals. Researching these stories and seeing how they achieved their goals can be very beneficial in our own pursuits. Taking the time to make sure you are properly informed and well-experienced can make all the difference. As citizens, it is our duty to understand the ins and outs of the election process to ensure that we make informed decisions. Along the same line, it is important to understand the impact of planning in our lives, and take time to come up with a plan that will guide us towards our desired objective.

"From Martin Luther King Jr.'s courageous stances to the motivating example of a personal trainer, setting a positive example can have far-reaching ripple effects.. First, it sets a clear vision for how a person, or an organization, thinks and behaves. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. By setting a good example of discipline and dedication, they will often be able to encourage clients to strive to reach their personal goals.

Finally, setting a good example models the desired behavior and helps to foster a sense of inclusion and mutual respect among team members. was a prime example of someone who set a high moral standard that extended beyond his own actions. 
Setting a good example is the best way to influence others for a variety of reasons. His commitment to equality inspired millions to act justly and bring about much-needed reform during the civil rights movement.

Second, setting a positive example can lead to greater motivation in others. Take, for example, a personal trainer. This can create an environment that is conducive to open and honest communication, leading to greater collaboration and problem-solving.

Setting a good example is indeed the best way to influence others",1

When I was in high school, I was determined to get a full-time job for the summer in order to save up money for college. No matter how big or small the goal might be, so long as I stay focused, stay determined, and work hard to make it happen, I know I can achieve greatness.. Despite the fact that it wasn't the most glamorous job, I showed up to work on time, hit my goals, and even worked extra shifts.

My hard work and determination paid off in the end. Not only did I save enough money for college, but I also gained valuable work experience and earned the admiration of my supervisors, who promoted me to a managerial position. This experience taught me the power of hard work and determination. It took hard work and dedication, but I eventually found a job as a cashier in a local grocery store",1

This shows that my father really cares about my future and want me to do well in life and showed me some wisdom in of how hard like will be if i don't do well in school. This shows that my father gave me some experience to get respected into the family.

Another thing that my father has shared with me is how to work at a business. For instance for the past few months my father has showed me how to do paper work at his second job. Has there been anyone in your life that shared any wisdom or experience with you? If not, why not ask someone that is important to you? They would love to share maybe a dad, mom ,grandparents they have tones of experience in the past. He would do bad choices like going out with his friends all the time and not listen to this parents. A person who has shared wisdom or experience with me would be my father ,because he has showed me how to be respectful to adults and show me how to work some business papers.

One thing that my father had shared with me is how to respect adults. My dad has to count the money that he was getting and how much to give back the workers. As well as listening to the adults, bow when entering a door and greeting them. For example, my father wasn't always the best child. In closing my father taught me how to do business and how to process one because I want to do business.

In conclusion a person who has showed me wisdom and experience would be my father by teaching me to respect adult and how to do paper work at his job. They thought he was trouble child, Soon when I was born ,and when i was able to talk and walk my. So a few times my dad would come into my room and teach me how to split the money they were making and pay the bills. Those days he showed me showed me how much money everything is ,and made me realized that I need to work very hard because if I want a simple job that I doesn't do much that gave a job that can pay my bills I need to work hard in school. My father would make me say please and thank you. H+e had showed me by telling about his past and show how to mange a business when I am older. My father did not want me to me like him when he was younger so he made sure I was respectful to my grandparents",0

"Energy efficiency measures help reduce the amount of energy resources consumed, reduce energy costs, and reduce the amount of pollutants that are released into the environment. By engaging in these initiatives, students will benefit their surrounding community and environment for generations to come.. Moreover, by conserving energy, students can help prevent the damaging effects of the greenhouse effect and make a positive difference in the world. They can also take part in initiatives that directly help people who are in need. 
In today's world, many students recognize the pressing importance of getting involved in their local community to make a meaningful and lasting difference for current and future generations. For example, students can assist at a food bank, donate clothing to homeless shelters, or volunteer at a homeless shelter. They can positively contribute to the world in many ways, from picking up litter to helping those in need, saving endangered animals, and preventing the greenhouse effect. 

Overall, students can help their community and the world through a variety of methods, including taking part in service projects, helping people in need, saving endangered animals, and implementing measures to conserve energy. By taking at least some of these steps, students can use their energy efficiently to power up the world. These projects demonstrate how students can make a difference in their surrounding environment while helping those who are struggling.

In addition to public service projects, students can take action to save endangered animals by advocating for humane treatment, preserving habitats, and promoting awareness. 

One way students can help positively change their local community is by taking part in public service projects, such as cleaning up a street or park, or organizing a charity auction",1
"Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools.

Overall, Working from home would benifit me because I like to work on the computers, I can take breaks, see my family, and be on my couch.. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home",0
"If you have a dog—or want to make one—making friends with other dogs is also a great way to spend time outdoors.

At the beach, there are more opportunities to relax and clear your mind. Take a walk and enjoy the surf, the sun, and the sand between your toes; go swimming, surfing, or paddleboarding; or just sit by the shore and reflect, letting the sound of the waves slow your breathing and soothe your soul. 
The beach and the outdoors present a wide variety of activities for everyone to enjoy. Going to the community park can be a great way to unwind, with lots of opportunities to meet new people, take your dog for a walk, and get some fresh air. If you're looking for someone to connect with, the beach is also a great place to meet people and make friends.. Training a dog can be both a challenging and rewarding activity, and you'll be able to watch your furry companion learn new tricks and skills",1

"Additionally, spending time with friends and peers can be an integral part of nurturing and expanding on our knowledge – being able to share new information and bounce ideas off each other can be invaluable. 
The enjoyment of educational activities is often rooted in the process of learning itself. In conclusion, the enjoyment of educational activities can come from many different sources, including learning new things, spending time with friends, and learning from mistakes.. Learning new things is an inherently rewarding experience, as our brains are biologically wired to respond positively to new and challenging experiences. Finally, mistakes and failures are a normal part of the learning process, and instead of looking at them as negative experiences, they can be seen as invaluable opportunities for personal growth and exploration",1
"After analyzing what went wrong in the application process, I applied to more positions and kept my enthusiasm up by challenging myself with new experiences. However, instead of letting it dampen my spirits, I chose to use it as a learning opportunity. By taking heed of Churchill’s words, I always strive to keep an energized outlook on the future and use failure as a learning opportunity.. Even when I fail, I always try to dust myself off and keep pushing forward with enthusiasm and an open mindset. 

I discovered the importance of this quote when I was applying for a job after graduating college. From this experience, I have learned to never settle — no matter how many times I fail. I have also learned to evaluate why I failed and use it as an opportunity to grow. Despite learning important skills in the university and preparing extensively, I was rejected from the position I wanted the most. After some reflection on my own life, I have come to agree with Winston Churchill’s quote, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm”. Although I was aware of the possibility of rejection, the actual experience was incredibly disheartening. 
Living a life of meaning and fulfillment means learning from our failures and embracing every experience with enthusiasm. After months of hard work and dedication, I finally got the job I wanted.

This experience taught me the importance of keeping enthusiasm in the face of failure",1
"so must people prefer to work and make money than have more hours of school. because everyone get tired or estreced, do not make enought money to buy resources, and dont have enougt time to be with the family.

The beneficts to conserve energy is to sleep the eight hours. because both of them are important for our life. In contrast if you do not sleep well you feel like you will felt sleep. so is better less hours of school because eveyone will conserve enegy and the less hours of school can bemore better because everyone would be consentrated and learn more.

Is hard to be in school and have a job after school. and the hours of school everyone can be more consetrated and don't felt sleep and learn the possible.. so they can conserve anergy and resources and have have enought time with the family. if you spend more time in a job or in school there is not enought time for the family and olso everyone need time to make the differents responsabiliies that have.

for these reasons my school should not follow this model because many people get extreced or cuit school. If I am working and also going to school and the school day extend for two hours. so for these reason my chool should not fallow this model. I feel very extreced, so many peolple cuit school. for this reason many people prefer to have money because can buy any resources or enyting that they need.

for example. so you can conserve the energy and don't be extreced about be more time in school. Some businesses have adopted a four day work week with each day consisting of ten hours

.To conserve energy and resources, my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours. And prefer to work.

There are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not inought time to be togeteher with the family.

everyone need time to have and be with the family because family is importan. but must people what need is money",0
"But some time people they don't like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. they said that becsause they never think about thre future or maybe they don't want to do nothing in the life and that is not going to work. In my position do work it's some i like to do every day because that's how i learn more stuff. for exaple I have a lot stuff to do for gratuade from hight school i have to pass my esol and have a good great grade if i don't graduate from hight school that choise i have is to work out side. That is mean if we don't work or study for a vetter life them we are not going to have nothing for .Exaplem if you are

18 or more you have to look for a jod becase you are respomsible for your self because your parents there are not going to give you anything what you want you have to work and buy your own stuff. Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle"" that is mean like some time we are busy. This is something posible we can do in us life.

Some may said that to do nothing is better life. However, if a want the opportituti to do something in the future the best choie is to study effort my self and go to the college to have a better jod.

people Sometimes they're bussy in keys that is something posible in us life becuse we want to become a good person and resposible in the future that's that way we learn it is easy to do something never give up.. I agree with this prompt becasause it's something posible and if we always doing something.

In my opinion we acomplish more if we are always doing something because some times we have stuff to do for example going to work after school or study after school. IF we have a park time after school that is something good because you are reciving money for your self and maybe you can help your parent with bills.

Some peoples think that if we don't do something in this life we ca have a vetter remposible",0
"Immigrants do not give up despite the many failures and obstacles they face in their pursuit of a better life. 
For example, Dr. It is this remarkable courage and determination that makes Immigrants some of the strongest people in the world.. They demonstrate the truth behind Churchill's statement that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Arambula and Atthaphon exemplify the unstoppable resilience of those who come to the United States and are determined to make a better life for themselves and their families. 
Immigrants come to the United States from all over the world in search of a better life, often facing difficult odds along the way. Despite these odds, many Immigrants persevere and build successful lives in their new home. Joaquin Arambula is an immigrant who found success after coming to the United States from Mexico. 
Another inspiring example is Atthaphon Sriburanasunthorn, an immigrant from Thailand who overcame language and cultural barriers to obtain an education and eventually become a neurosurgeon.

Immigrants like Dr. An advocate for health education and Latino communities, he now serves in California's State Assembly",1

If everyone have a good attitude we live in armony and don't had problems to each others. The attitude is one of the main charisma that a student has to have. The workers don't have problems with the chief or the boss.

Second, I think that the attitude is important have in the school because every student have to go to the school everyday with a good attitude. I think that in the family is more important to have a good attitude. many people don't have a good attitude with others , but it's important have good attitude in everywhere to be a good people.

Research has shown that having an older student assist in teaching a younger student provides numerous benefits. The knowledge and experience the older student has to offer can help the younger one gain a better understanding of their subject material. By working with an older student, the younger student can benefit from a higher level of intelligence, better preparation for the future, and improved efficiency with their schoolwork.. Additionally, the older student can provide help with homework, allowing the younger student to get a better grasp of the material and develop stronger study skills over time. As an older student, the younger student can gain insight into what it will take to be successful in their studies as they prepare for life beyond school",1
"Seeing these examples of success helped me to better understand the determination and hard work it took to overcome obstacles. Additionally, I was driven forward by the inspiration of others and their success stories. I knew I wanted to be successful, but was finding it difficult to make decisions about the path I should take. Setting a goal helped to narrow my focus, giving me an achievable target that I could set my sights on. Having received a college degree in my chosen field of study, I was well-prepared to begin my career but lacked direction. At the same time, I also realized that the journey could be filled with obstacles and required hard work and dedication in order to achieve it. 

By focusing on small achievable tasks each day, I was able to slowly progress towards my goal. 
I have had firsthand experience of the effects of setting a goal in life. Taking this initiative to set a goal and strive towards my aspirations allowed me to grow not only as a professional but also as a person.",1

One of the main debates of 2020 for many students is whether attending classes from home is beneficial or detrimental. Furthermore, students become more comfortable using technology and digital tools, which can give them a head start in their professional career.

On the other hand, there are also numerous negative aspects that students should take into account regarding classes from home. It is undeniable that virtual education has its advantages and disadvantages that must be deeply considered when making the decision of whether to attend classes physically or virtually. Additionally, by learning from home there is no need to worry about a long commute: this can free up more time for studying and leisure activities. 

In conclusion, there are both benefits and drawbacks to taking classes from home, but each student should carefully consider their own situation and prioritize their individual needs when deciding whether remote education is the best option for them.. Additionally, when learning from home, students can sometimes become more isolated and distracted, which can lead to a decrease in concentration, low motivation, and reduced academic performance. This can lead to a more personal and self-motivated learning experience. 

For starters, classes from home allow students to go at their own pace, as well as giving them the opportunity to work on their own and on their own time. As virtual instruction eliminates in-person contact, it can be harder to expand the student's knowledge base and nurture their creative thought processes",1
"Especially the way people look at you will be changed to positive and respect. I agree with that. Nobody could be a good doctor, a good architecture, or anything good think, unless they tried hard and focused. Nobody want to hire or work with a lazy people, because they have none, they can't make a good result. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."".. With the good habit, we always feel good and comfortable to study, learn, and do everything. In the road of the success, it would never had a footprint of lazy people. We should not feel enough for something, that'll be a reason make us become lazy. So working hard, and always doing something is the key to open the successful gate.

In the road of the success, it would never had a footprints of lazy people. Good habit also help you create a good process.

An active process creates the positive success. Restaurant would not able to serve a delicious meal, if they didn't have a good preparation. We can't have a good result, if we'll be lazy, and inactivity doing, learning something. An active process creates a the positive success, and in the road of the success, it would never had a footprints of lazy people.

We'll create a good habit and accomplish more, if we are always actively focusing and doing something. We are the same. It'll make everything easier. Never enough for something. So we should work hard every time, and we should not think:"" Inactivity would serve a purpose"".

We should work hard to get and good process, and the good process'll create success. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... People,who are always doing something will get a good habit. We accomplish more if we are always doing something",0
"Motivation and having energy are some keys that can help people aim for something big and be albe to accoplish their goals.

Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set.

The great artist Michelangele once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

Setting your aims low and achieving your marks is not the great danger or a danger. However, setting your aim too high and falling short is a great danger because you can learn from it. The greater danger for most of us is setting our aims too high and falling short because many people try to aim for something that's imposible for them to accomplish, falling short on your goal will make you want to give up, and not having the motivation and energy will get you no where.

Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we can't accoplish it.

For example: some people aim to be perfect; but that's imposible because no one is perfect.

Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they don't have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en they're wasting their time.

The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if they're aiming to high.

Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short.

Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure.

This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for.

Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if you're a failure, then you'll face many challenges and suffer.

Many successful people in the world accomplish their goals because they have the motivation and energy on doing better; but many people don't have a motivation or energy that they get no where in life.            ",0

Thats why I thank that having a good attitude will make people want to hang out with you.

Last but not list having a good attitude will make people respect you. Some benefits of having a good attitude are that more people will like you another reason is that people will want to hang out with you and the last reason is that people will respect you.

Having a good attitude will get people to like you. It will make people respect you because you will treat people with respect and theres a saying that says treat people how you would like to be treat. A reason why is because you won't be boring and will have positive things to talk about. It will also get people to like you because they will tank your a wonderful and positive person.

In conclusion, there are clear advantages and disadvantages of both working in a group and working alone. Conversely, when working in a group, it can be possible for one’s focus to be shifted and diluted as working in a group is an interactive process. There is also potential to build off of one another’s ideas. Working in a group can have many advantages; work can be shared more evenly, there is potential for more innovative ideas, and it can be a more social and enjoyable task. Having people to work with and trade ideas off of can be seen as a benefit. Whether one chooses to work in a group or alone ultimately depends upon the task at hand and the individual’s preferences.. 

When it comes to ideas, working in a group allows for more creative freedom due to the helpful insight and ideas from others. 
When it comes to completing a task, people may have various preferences on whether to work in a group or alone. On the other hand, working alone can also have its own advantages such as allowing one to focus and stay focused on the job, and ensuring that all the responsibility is solely on the individual. 

In terms of focus, working alone can be important as it allows the individual to settle in and stay on task without potential distractions from others. 

When it comes to workload, working in a group has the potential to be more efficient due to sharing workloads and having several minds on the same task. With having all the responsibility solely resting on one’s shoulders when working alone, there can be pressure that limits creative thinking. On the other hand, when working alone, an individual will have to carry the entire workload and manage their own time and motivations. Conversely, when one works alone, there is a greater chance for boredom and disconnection from the task. 

In terms of fun, working in a group has greater potential for being enjoyable and entertaining",1
"By starting earlier, teens can gain more experience, explore available options, and earn qualifications that can accelerate their progress. It is important for teens to consider their options carefully and think about the potential upsides and downsides before committing to a specific career path.. 

In conclusion, while deciding on a career path in teenage years can give young people a significant advantage, there are potential risks in making this decision too early. Additionally, teens can often become so focused on one career that they miss out on various other opportunities, especially if the chosen career path doesn’t work out. While there are some advantages to deciding on a career at an early age, there are some potential drawbacks that should be considered. Teens who pursue this approach are also likely to have a greater clarity regarding their career choices when they become adults. 
It is not uncommon for young teenagers to dream of a career and make the decision to pursue a specific career path in their teenage years. 

However, there are some important disadvantages to young teenagers making the decision to pursue a specific career. 

The primary advantage of young teenagers choosing to pursue a career early is that it can give them a head start on their desired career. One of the primary drawbacks is that, although teenagers may have a clear idea of what they want to do, they may not take into account any personal and professional changes that may occur as they enter adulthood",1
"Based on my experience people should be positive and be around positive people, listen to positive music and found activities that incorporate positive attitude.

People should find new friends that give good vibes and help them become a better person, because sometimes the problem might not be themselves , might be people thats around you telling bad stuff, and always making you a have a bad day.

Changing the music that you listen to, could help you be more positive, because most of the songs and artists that most people listen to these days, sign about, drugs, killing people, gang related stuff, and thats good if you want to be positive.

Founding activities that incorporate positive attitude could help also, like going to church, going to the movies with the family, or going to a motivational speeches, will get you into a positive mood and forget about all those negative stuff going on in your life.

Being positive is good, and it makes you feel good and have success in life, but not always is good, because, life sometimes is unfair and we have to deal with it, we cant be leaving thinking that everything is good, when the reality is that the world is getting worst and worst everyday.

Looking ahead in the future, i see the new generation incorporating positive activities over the whole world, and making the whole world see life of a good and successful perspective.. One day my mom told, "" son, be positive in your life,and everything will be of success"". Since i started to be more positive in my life, everything was looking better, i found the job that i wanted, i bought my first car, and, me and my family move to a new house, overall everything was looking better",0
"Take for example, two people you meet at a party. Building a strong sense of presence by making eye contact and conveying confidence in one's words and body language are also essential. When it comes to a person's physical appearance, paying attention to details such as clothing, postures, and facial expressions can go a long way in developing trust. A person's attitude, values, and sense of humor, for example, can only be truly observed over a longer period of time. Person A is dressed very sharply and has excellent public speaking skills, alluding to confidence and intelligence. Finally, engaging in positive conversations with those you meet and actively listening to their ideas can help establish a positive initial impression.. Person B, on the other hand, is wearing more casual clothing and is more reserved in his speech. However, this initial impression doesn't always tell the full story and it's possible that person B may actually be more competent over time. Developing communication skills such as the ability to ask meaningful questions and make meaningful conversation can also be incredibly beneficial. 
First impressions are often incredibly influential when forming opinions of one another. A person's looks, personality, and communication skills all play major role in how we perceive them initially. Most people would form an initial impression of person A as professional, while person B might be seen as more casual and laid-back. 

There are several ways to improve your first impression",1
"Online classes, i think that if students really trying to learn something is not need for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach al the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every class room, and i think that online classes are not a bad idea because they been teach by a computer and they have to pay attention or they will fail, but at school they wont fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and thats how they will pass classes better at school then online .

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",0
"But he tried again and again and he never gave up and now he is one of the most famous journalists in Morocco without any experience and still better then the one that do have experiences.

First of all ,an employee doesn't need experience to find a job , he just need to be loyal to his job and work hard and be such an honest person to make his work go even higher and help spread love and respect at his job to all the people .

Second , it's not necessarily that it has to do with jobs obviously ; it can be acting or sports or anything you want to do .You don't certainly need to have experience to do it just like Mohamed Ali said :'Everyone start out as a beginner "", but in term of jobs you just have to show your employers how much you deserve this job and that you can be a better candidate to hire . For me , experience have nothing to do with jobs everything depends on the work you're going to do and not the work you have done , and I'm pretty sure that the persons with no experience will rock it more than the ones that do have experiences and just keep in your mind the positive energy and you'll make it just like my father did and my french friend did .. A lot of a good workers are doing all their best to find new jobs and a believing future for themselves , most of them are responsible and confident that they can do anything to make the work up and even more better than it before , but they usually don't find it because they don't have experiences and these employers don't want to hire them just because of that .

Although, a lot of people may argue that employees may need experience to find jobs but actually none of that is right .There's a lot of people that found jobs and succeed without experience , you just have to keep believing and never give up. My father didn't found a job too and he is mom was sick and he had me as his son so young . My father told me that mostly the workers that don't have experiences are the ones that work hard and always bring ideas that push the job even higher and they usually have positive attitude and a positive vibe that makes the boss love them more then the other employees.

Third, I don't know why all these employers don't give a chance to the employees just to see what they can do , there's a lot of people that didn't even got a chance to show their work , even thought they can be the best at it .I have a french friend that wanted to be a teacher assistant for a french class here in the United States of America , but all the schools didn't accept her as a teacher because she didn't had much experience in teaching and that is just not fair .She is french and she can teach better because she is from the country where the language is coming from and that's how the students will learn pretty easily , that's why I believe that the employers should change their opinion about the experiences.

Finally , It really doesn't matter if you don't have experiences because if you believe in your self it means that you can get any job you want , just keep the hard work and all these employers that still think that experience is necessary will regret it after because they will see you at the top . He had no experience in any domain and he needed a job pretty badly to pay the rent and grandma's surgery . But you need to prepare for it thought because you don't want to look like a person that can not bring the job up and that you don't know anything about it",0

Extending the school day by one and a half hours could provide numerous benefits for both students and teachers alike. For students, this extra time could be used for enrichment activities such as tutoring, clubs, and elective courses. Ultimately, extending the school day by one and a half hours could be an invaluable asset for both students and teachers.. For teachers, this additional time could be used to provide professional development and mentorship opportunities, giving them the chance to further develop their skills and share knowledge with their colleagues. This could provide them with the opportunity to explore and develop interests outside of the traditional curriculum",1
"From seeing inspiring and powerful messages in television commercials to reading motivating articles on the internet, people are often moved by the messages they ingest without ever knowing the source. 

In addition, people can be influenced by the media without direct contact. In fact, individuals can be influenced by various other sources, such as television, the internet, or simply by other people's ideas. 

For example, when a person views an influential figure and is inspired by her ideals, she may start to emulate the characteristics that make that person successful. 
In his statement, Albert Schweitzer argues that ""example is the only thing in influencing others."" While this statement holds true in many cases, it is not a requirement for influencing people. With the myriad of possible influences available to people, direct example is just one small piece of the puzzle.. That doesn't necessarily mean she has had direct contact with the individual, and yet she is still being influenced. 

Therefore, while direct example certainly has its place as a powerful tool for influence, it is not the only one and certainly not the only way to affect the behavior of others",1
"Fist, the student will have more knowledge. So when you learn new stuff you can be ahead of your class. The reasons i would argue for students and teachers having a after school program. Passing quizzes can bring your grade from a F to a D+. Finally , So they students can study for quiz and test and pass the quiz and test. Passing test can bring your grade from a F to a C+. If you get a good grade on mostly all your test then your gonna have good grades and thats a fact. There's more reasons but those are my reasons.

When you go to school you learn. So they bring you from a failing grade to a passing grade.

Teachers and Students Volunteer to meet with those who either have difficulty in a certain subject or wanna finish there homework .

Why is it after school ? . Learn more and youll have a better career.

When you get tough new stuff it can be fun to learn about the new stuff your learning about . Learning new stuff can make you twenty percent smarter than you usually are. quizzes are mini test so you should also try to pass them because both are huge deals. The more you learn the easier it is to get in collage . The longer you stay the more you learn more . Learning new stuff can get you a better job in the future.

There's always time to learn new stuff .

By going to a after school program you can study for quiz and test. Second , When students are in private with teachers the teachers will teach them new stuff. Collage looks at people who learn a lot so the after school program is gonna make them have a better future",0
"While technology has revolutionized how we live, the side effects cannot be overlooked. 

Technology has undoubtedly become an integral part of our way of life. One such side effect is that people are slowly losing their ability to think for themselves. 

The exponential growth of technology over the past decade has meant that technology is now everywhere. This addiction has significantly reduced the amount of time that we are spending thinking and reasoning for ourselves. However, it is important to recognize the negative effects that it can have, as this may lead to us losing the ability to think for ourselves and be self-reliant. This has led to many people becoming dependent on technology as a mental crutch, and caused us to lose our ability to think independently.

Another way that technology has negatively impacted our lives is how it has become both an addiction and a distraction. As an example, the many online banking sites and financial calculators available have become the norm, as opposed to manually calculating and budgeting ourselves. If we are not careful, our current generation and future generations may suffer because of it.. 
In the modern technological world, it is hard to ignore the potentially negative impact that technology has had on our lives. With the ability to access the internet and social media from wherever we are, a large portion of our days are now spent aimlessly browsing. Instead of relying on our own problem-solving abilities, we are increasingly relying on technology to do things for us",1
"There is also evidence that online classes can foster student engagement as students are in control of when and how they access their education. Online classes also often lack the personal connections and relationships that come from face-to-face instruction. One pro is that online classes can be taken at any time and from any location, making them more accessible to people who have difficulty attending a standard class. Furthermore, several studies have shown that students tend to be less successful in passing online classes than in traditional classroom courses.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to taking online classes, there are also disadvantages to consider. 
Online classes have been increasingly popular as technology advances and the need for social distancing increases. Additionally, online classes make it easier for students to collaborate and communicate with one another in discussion forums or chat rooms. 

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to taking online classes. There are several advantages and disadvantages to taking courses online. It can be difficult for students to motivate themselves when there is no professor present and no regular deadlines and expectations. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to take online classes should be made on an individual basis, taking into account student engagement, difficulty of passing, and student-teacher relationships.",1
"What would happen if school offer the program to student that qualify for the program that only take three year of high school instead of the four years. Here are some examples, and reason why is a good idea for school to offer this types of programs.

Reason number one is that students that had A's and B's in the past years like middle school and the beginning of high school maybe qualify for the three year insted of the four year of high shool, because they are so intelligen that they not need the four years of high school.

Reason number two is that if they graduate from high school they may like to apply for a community service for there college aplication.

Reason number three is that some student don't have the money to pay for college so they may need a year to save some money to pay for college, or some student may not like college so they are only going to finish high school, and they are going straight to work, and the more experience you learnd form a jod the better it is so is a good idea to begin at a younger age.

So i think that the program that school offer to studen for them to take the opportunity to graduate early from high school is a good idea beacuse it will help them alot in there life.",0

The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. Furthermore, local school districts could be faced with strain due to the heightened burden of providing teachers, resources, and updating curriculum to accommodate the addition. In conclusion, the implications of adding extra time to the school day should be carefully considered before any additional hours are added.. For example, it is possible that student performance could improve if they are given extra time to focus on studies or better understand the material. Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours",1
"However, when the students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside which is bad for the students safety. Imagine you are in school and you had to sit an a room with four wall. Beside, the students will not have a lot of time to sleep.

Furthermore, one day the students will not have the energy to go to school. How would you feel after all of that? Beside, students might not function well, since there is more class time which means more classwork and homework. An addition, when students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside. Which is a unfair for students and it's bad for the students safety.

Next, students will not have time to spend with there family members nor there friends because they would have homework and projects to do. In the same token, students would not be motive to play or have fun because all they would think about is school. However, they are tired from the school and school work as a result, they will not function right. Students will not function well, since there is more class time which means more class work. lastly, one day the students will not have energy to go to school.. In the same way, they would not be motive to play or have fun because the students mid will not construed. And then you had to stay in that room for another one and a half hour. That is why the school board should not add one and half hour to the school day.

First, some students have sports, clubs and many things to do after school. Moreover, you had a frustrating day because of teachers, students and school work. Additionally, some students have sports and many things to do after school. Which put the students in a high risk.

In conclusion, The school board should not add one and half to the school hours. And the students might not even want to come to school any more. For example, my friend plays soccer and she had school for another one and half hour when she went to practice she passed out, since her brain was not function nether were her body. Neither will teacher have time to spend with there kids, since they have test to grad and paper work. Similarly, they will become depressed and have a negative mood. Moreover, students and teacher will not have time to spend with there family members, nor there friends because they would have homework and projects to do",0
"It may seem insurmountable at times, but failure can often be the stepping stone to success. Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it plays a pivotal role in the pursuit of success. The relationship between failure and success is one that, if handled correctly, can lead to incredible accomplishments.. Learning to fail and getting back up again is key to growing and achieving success. Even when starting a new job or feeling the pressure of not having complete confidence, failure can give you the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and make sure you don't make them again.

"So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.

Second reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.

Overall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.

Overall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. When you do not even use it half of the time. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after.                                   . Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. At times we take advantage way too much. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Rather than wasting alot of materials for no good reasons. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.

There is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there",0

". Like the more you imagine about things you experience through your job, the less knowledge you have to learn about something that haven't exist in the ability of inventing something creative that is very useful and better than anything.

All you have to do is believe in yourself and use your imagination like to decide whether invent something particular than the other like building a house, a long bridge, and create like a watch to study about anything and learn more about it, you can invent, create, study anythingby using your imagination by experiencing more about things you want to do when you grow up by using your brain, and knowledge to put more effort into jobs. I agree that imagination is more important than knowledge because when you imagine of doing something very important, like for example; you want to be successful in school education to become like a doctor, teacher, artist, or scientist.

Anyone in the world can be a smart and better person by working on a job to study about objects, study about computers like the use of technology and the learning of cybersecurity, and to visualize and gain your experiences on working in any job you want work on by putting effort and using your brain.

For example, you can imagine of becoming a scientist to learn about sceince, like chemicals, plants, experiments, and understanding more information about science and other objects by experiencing things. You can also invent instruments, like an accordion, violin, guitar, and a piano, and you can imagine anything like cool stuff, like being an expert at teaching in school like a teacher, studying science,

being a doctor, a builder to invent or build stuff like buildings, or a manager who is in charge of training any team or an athlete for the next match, by having the ability to use your imagination.

We all know that using your imagination is a better thing to do than using knowledge, like imagining to build, invent, or do anything in your experience by learning more imformation, support, and details about using imagination of doing anything",0
"These sources of guidance provide an opportunity to learn from experts and ask questions in order to gain an informed opinion. It provides an opportunity to take responsibility for the outcomes and to learn from mistakes. Having the ability to make decisions on one's own can be beneficial in the long run; however, seeking guidance can also have its advantages.. Having control over decisions helps build confidence and autonomy, allowing individuals to develop their own problem-solving skills and gain experience with making important decisions.

"That could be a good opportunity for students if they finish school early they can be more independent, also can make more money a early age and build a magnificent future, another good thing it's they can buy whatever they want, and don't have to be necessary ask their parents for money also save money for their career at college.

At school we can see different kinds of age some guys are older that others, so maybe some students want to finish school a early time, If the students finish school early they can be more independent, and see how life goes life isn't easy and all of us one day will learn how to be more independent. Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Be independent it is a responsibility because you have to take care about something as; pay some bills, if you have car, well take care about the insurance, for some reason you live by yourself have to pay where do you live, and other responsibilities.

Second, make money a early age is a amazing thing to do because you will prepare for the future your goal is finish school, and maybe that would require extra effort like take courses during the summer, or work in the evenings to make up things that you need to do in another class, maybe that require extra work.                . Build a great future would make your life easier. All dedication that you put, for sure you would have a recompense in the future, also don't have to worry for money because you are working hard for that.

Finish school early that can help you to be more successful like work for your own things, so if you need something you don't have ask a your parents for money; to get what you want, and another good thing is you can earn, save money for you career in college. A young age you are getting prepare to what's is next.

However, everyone choose what they want, some things would benefits your future and if you wanna make it work out in less time you can make it possible, there always another way to find out what you want, need, and to be a succeful person in the future. At some point, you may not able to take elective courses but that decision is made by yourself, if your goal is finish school early you have to leave some things to get what you want",0
"Those who always work also always compare themselves to others who are working, and often times do not take into account that what they are doing is very unhealthy. Thomas Jefferson, writer of the Declaration of Independence and founding father of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" In Jefferson's eyes, a world spent in constant work and motion represents a more productive and accomplished world. Therefore, a world spent constantly working does not always represent a world of accomplishment.

Some argue that if one is not always working, then one cannot accomplish as much as one can, as a minute spent idle could lead to a day spent idle, and so on. Time spent idle does not equal time spent wasted; time spent idle is time spent reflecting, planning, and developing. This is because their brains cannot comprehend the constant work, and moves to other unhealthy tactics of releasing emotions. A prime example of this concept is the work of artists. All of these concepts combined greatly heighten the chance in the deterioration of mental health. A world that is idle when it recognizes its need to be has more value than a world that is always working, as it allows time for cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration.

In the body, the brain represents an entity that is constantly developing, creating new ideas, and planning for the future. Thus, if the world was constantly working, there would be no inspiration. Also, brainstorming represents one of the most important parts of formulating any plan for any person in any situation, and constant work does not allow time for that brainstorming and inspiration to occur. The potential of the human brain would reduce, as the human brain would never have the time to step back and reflect on its past experiences and how it wants to reflect lessons learned from those experiences in the future. Furthermore, if one's life is spent constantly working, one's brain is exposed to extreme competition and high standards. A person always working does not represent a person living life to the fullest. Inspiration flows from person to person, and if everyone was working constantly, no one would serve as a source of inspiration for others around them. For example, if Thomas Jefferson had not taken time off to create new ideas and plan for his country before writing the Declaration of Independence, the United States would be very different from the way it is today. This concept ties in with the concept of unhealthy comparison, which further proves why mental health is one of the largest reasons as to why the world cannot constantly work. If a human was always working, there would be no time to create new ideas or plan. Many studies show that top students in classes, those who never stop working towards their goals, can have a greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, or addiction to drugs. A world that is always working may also be a world that is burning out, diminishing the value of building connections and reflecting. These two concepts are unhealthy for the human brain, as one may believe that they actually are not working hard enough and need to work themselves even harder, when reality shows that they already work themselves unhealthily. Without inspiration, the world would not be where it is today.

Cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration represent three of the most essential reasons as to why the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson cannot apply to how the world works today. Several stories in the world detail the downfall of the most intelligent people, simply because the never took a break for themselves. In schools, teachers emphasize the necessity of brainstorming before writing, and this concept is emphasized so much because inspiration is what leads to the development of mankind. If one's brain is constantly in a working state, it will never spend time appreciating the beauty of the world around it and taking in inspiration for future plans. The United States and our world today would not be the same without time spent idle,. Role models also result from the need for the world to take a break, as it allows for humans to gather inspiration from others and plan how they want to lead their lives. A world spent working constantly is a world exposed to bad mental health.

Finally, if the world is spent constantly working, then there is no time for inspiration of any sort. However, there is merit in a world that does not work without break and resolves to be idle at times. If students did not take time off to develop, their potential for achievement in life would reduce. In colleges, the requirements for acceptance do not only include academic excellence - they also include extracurriculars and attention to when the brain needs a break. Contrastingly, if one is always working, then one has a much greater risk of crashing. Time spent being idle carries the potential to be a valuable learning experience to the human life, as well. Constant work leads to stunted development, deteriorated mental health, and no sources for inspiration. Every idea would be thought of on the spot, and the potential ramifications and consequences of each idea would not be carefully taken into consideration. Mental health is an essential reason as to why the world today does not and cannot constantly work as Jefferson wants it to. In addition, the human brain requires breaks to keep working, just as the human body needs sleep to continue on the next day in a healthy state. If an artist such as Vincent Van Gogh or Claude Monet was constantly working, said artist would never spend time collecting inspiration, and the work of said artist would be mediocre instead of beautiful and inspiring. Without time spent being idle, the inventions, buildings, ideas, movies, and other parts of the world today would have never come to fruition",0
"Having a positive attitude all the time is not the key to life. Being that you could have a happy life is possible but you will always come across obsticles that you can't just be positive about and not caring for. Imagine a heart break, loving someone for so long but them leaving you just cause they didn't want to date you anymore. Having a positive attitude all the time would only make things worse cause you don't always have the best days. In cunclusion, having a positive attitude is not the key to life because you will always have a gloomy day and there won't be an escape then.. Would't you be misserable if you had a positive attitude all the time, always looking happy and never looking down. If it was then why do so many people have to get hurt in our day and age. That's why Being positive isn't they key to life, if it was the key to life then why do so many bad people live on this earth, and want to do bad thing to others just living the're lives. Someone can tell you bad news, like someone dying, you can't be positive during someones death, especially if its someone close to you. Something can always happen in any moment at anytime in you're life. Due to the lack of happiness people get depressed, sad and lonley.

"Furthermore, addressing a wide variety of individuals allows a message to reach diverse audiences, and to be tailored in a way that increases its persuasive power.

In some cases, a combination of behavior and discussion may be the most effective method of influencing others. Ultimately, the best approach may arise from an understanding of the individual’s needs and preferences. By engaging in discussion or debate, we can both present evidence for a particular point of view and invite counter-arguments. Demonstrating the desired behavior or attitude can show others what is valued and expected, and provides them with a template for following that example. By providing an example to follow and discussing why it is being pursued, it is possible to shape the thoughts and beliefs of those around us. While setting a good example is one reliable method, there may be better ways to influence other people depending on the situation.. 
It is often said that “actions speak louder than words” – and indeed, setting a good example through one’s own behavior and choices can be an effective way to influence other people. However, there may be more impactful and direct ways to influence those around us.

Speaking openly and persuasively on the issue is one key way to influence others. Doing so can help to spark ideas and challenge perspectives in a way that simply modeling the desired behavior may not",1
"The history would repeat itself and many of the tragic historical events that happened in the past would happen again.

There would be no regulation in the country. laziness is a big wooden door which can only open by ourselves and once we open that door, theres always something big waiting to happen and once we accomplish that another big adventure awaits.

In the history of United States, there were many people who idolized idle. If we could just go out and just help one person and day, that person would help another and another to another, this would be such a great accomplishment.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson said and believe that there is more happiness in doing something everyday then being a idle. We talk about the American Dream a lot but being lazy and just waiting for something to happen will not take us anywhere.

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more.

We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive.

Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish.

I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work. I hope everyone see's how much bad impact idle is in our lives.. Even small chores prepare us for something big. the country was poor, people died because of huger, disease etc but now the country has accomplished so much then the people in our past would have imagined. There are people who believe in not having to go outside their house because they have all the technologies or they think they have nothing to do. We had a government who let the country run free, this had a great impact to the country. Technologies serve their own purpose but we have our own purpose, we are born to do something big. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to. The country is well know all over the world now. Imagine the president and the government of our country being nothing but idle and letting the country run on its own. The country has accomplished by establishing government regulation which removed all the laziness from the country",0
"Imagine myself on that scenario with the lights, music, the public, while I am realizing a magnificent performances is something that makes my feel really grate. Kids play to have different jobs, but I know, since I was a baby, what I want to do. Some students aren't really interested on the place they go, playing around, acting boring, but not me, I am really interesting in this opportunity, in all the special details of the world of preforming arts. I want to inspire people in the same way that actors inspires me.

My love for the performant arts isn't the unique reason why a should go, I am a respectful and courteous person; a hardworker which goal is to learn everything about arts. The world of the entertainment, in special the theater, is something that always catch my attention, thats why I would like to visit the Art and Performance Center.

The principal reason why I want to go is for my family influences, my grandma has been dreaming about me been an actress. I know she would be so happy if I become an actress.

Also, the Art and Performance Center has been the place of one of my favorites presentations,""The Rose"", the feelings that the esterpians transmit during the hold act are powerful; they make you feel that you are part o the show, or even better, they make you feel that is not a show. When I was littler, I use to participate on local shows every summer, her proud smile and happy tears make me feel that I was on the right place, doing the right thing. I remember going to the theater with her, telling me that her biggest dream is, one day, see me on one of those performances or shows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          . From the backstage to the actual scenario, everything would be a delaitful experience for me.

For all this reasons, I would like to go to the Art and Performance Center, seeing all the components and experiences that brings you the fantastic world of the theater",0
"With advances in technology across all areas, the future promises to be even more exciting.. One of the most significant positives of technology is its effect on education. Online books such as those available on Kindle or iPads make it easier to access a wider range of titles, and can also be cheaper than buying a traditional paper book. It has made many aspects of life more convenient and efficient. This will unlock many potential applications with far reaching implications. For example, advanced medical diagnostics and treatments, smart homes that monitor energy usage for cost and convenience, and more personalized learning experiences tailored to individual students.

In conclusion, technology has had a very positive impact on people's lives, particularly in education. 
Technology has revolutionized the way people live and interact with each other. Additionally, video chat apps such as Zoom and Skype enable students to collaborate and communicate with each other in greater detail and from afar.

The possibilities of future advances in technology are virtually limitless. It has allowed for more personalized instruction, greater access to materials and resources, and opened up entirely new ways for collaboration among students. As computer science and engineering become more widespread, computers will become ever more powerful",1
"I know is hard to trust someone who doesn't act or look the same as you. Ideas are part of what you should take seriously in your life. Other unknown person's decision is what you should never do in your personal life.                                                                  . I would take my decision and ask my self should I trust them or not?

Secondly, trusting your team will not always be the same but you should follow your instincts. However, every day or every time you want to ask someone for help you must know who you are asking. Example, one day I made a bad decision of not cleaning the back yard of my house for like three months and it was fall and what happened was that it got full of leaves. What I do when I have to take a decision of doing something is to think the decision twice.

In conclusion, never give up a decision of you doing the right thing. Also, getting it done is not going to be easy but sometimes you need to try. For example, lets say you are a soccer player and you have a game but you don't trust your team mates what is going to happen is that you might lose that game. Always do what your parents says or ask you to do because they are the ones who wants you to accomplish your dreams, be there when they need you, talk to them when you need to. Should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? People should make their own decisions because if you trust your decision there is no reason why you should ask someone else. When I saw my back yard full of leaves I ask to myself why did I make the decision of not cleaning the back yard. Putting some trust on your decision can help you do what is right or wrong. The idea of going to school should be one of the most important things you should do.

Thirdly, asking for help in taking a decision is not a bad idea. Other people who you should talk to are your siblings. For example, if you want to ask someone what you should do after graduation must come from you but sometimes you can ask questions to your family and talk about it, they might know what is the right thing you should do.

People agree with you taking your own decisions than doing what other says. If you take wrong decisions will cause you things that you don't want. However, part of your decision needs to come from your heart.

Firstly, If you want to accomplish a dream in your life you need to put some extra work trying to get it done",0

"While working alone is beneficial in some cases, it is often more beneficial to have a group of people who are dedicated and motivated to work together towards a common goal. This can help ensure that no one person is overwhelmed with too much work and hold the team accountable for completing their tasks in a timely manner.

Furthermore, working with others provides an opportunity for people to learn from each other. Working in a group also leads to a sense of community and collaboration, which can help build rapport between members. 

In conclusion, it is clear that there are many benefits of working in a group versus working alone. 
When considering the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that teamwork has certain advantages. From increased productivity and effort, to learning from each other and creating a sense of community, working in a group can help people to make progress on challenging projects, learn new skills, and work together towards a common goal.. For starters, when trying to tackle a complex problem or project, there is often more brain power within a group than an individual. Working in a group enables different individuals to come together and share their unique insights and perspectives, helping complete the task quickly and efficiently. Discussions and brainstorming can help bring new and innovative ideas to the table and help everyone learn from each other. Working in a group also allows people to divide the workload, so each individual is responsible for a certain component or task. This helps create a supportive and encouraging environment, which can inspire individuals to continue working hard and reach their goals",1

"Not everyone is able to be like that.

Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. Students know what is best for them and know what will benifit them and find a path that would be best for there needs.

Some people might say that having students pick a career at a young age will help them in the future because it will give them more time so strengthen that career and become very good at it. For example if a student is being forced in a scientific field of learning but they know that science isnt there strong suit they will have a hard time and start having a hard time in that field. There are people who are sad and deperessed on the job they have now. It takes time,focus, and motivation for a student to find the career they truly would want to take in the future.

Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. And in doing so when they are doing something that they never imagined themselves doing then depression and regret will start happening.

With the job they are being forced into doing they might not be able in doing it. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. People wished that they could of done something to change what they do for a living and do something they will be truly happy with. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. What people dont understand is that some students might not be intersted in that and would want something they would b happy with so they can improve on the stuff they know they are good at and have alot of skill in. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing. Students have the right and the liberty in choosing a carrer they would want to do for the rest of there lives they dont need to be pushed into doing it they should take as much time as they need to find what is it that would make them happy.. There are people who are not happy with the career path they took",0
"In the end, I was accepted to my dream school and graduated with honors. Each failure has provided me with the tools and experiences necessary to better persevere and face the next challenge. 
As someone who has experienced failure on numerous occasions, I must say I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasm. Instead, I applied to more schools, studied harder, and took on more extracurricular activities. 

For example, in high school, I applied to college and was rejected. Most of my successes have been a result of my ability to keep pushing forward despite my many failures and lack of enthusiasm. 

All of this is to say that failure is an integral part of life and if accepted and embraced can be turned into success. I learned the importance of adapting to changing circumstances and developing a positive attitude in order to achieve my goals, which is why I agree with Winston Churchill’s statement that success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasm.. Although it wasn't what I wanted at the time, the experience taught me that failure is not the end of the world. Throughout my life, I have learned that every time I have faced a difficult challenge or failed at something, I have become a stronger and more resilient person",1
"Maybe you just don't understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. For example, when you're working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. . This method can also help you with a project. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something that's completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. You know he is wrong.

Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you don't understand the information or don't have enough to back it up. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them.

If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure it's correct and the best. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didn't have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldn't give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test.

You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing it's more likely to be true than the one that doesn't. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and that's what helped survive for so long. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting.

So, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person.

You should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem. More is better than one. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better",0

When it comes to advice and wisdom, listening to the elders can be incredibly beneficial. Generic_Name may have insight into areas such as career choices, investments, and other matters that are related to the world today.

Take the example of Generic_Name and Grandma—both have plenty of life experience to offer. Grandma, on the other hand, may be able to offer advice and wisdom related to topics like family dynamics, social situations, and moral guidance. Listening to the wisdom of those more experienced can be an incredibly useful resource for anyone looking to make well-informed decisions.",1

"When we face up with difficult problem, it gives us more valuable experience in the life, i think this experience is too hard to find in book, or school. Day by day, everything is changing rapidly. Therefore, the student finish high school early; it is very neccessary to prepare for new challenges in the life.

As we can see, the economy is delicated and various, so you have more time to find an occupation which is suitable for you. I think this is a most important problem. Actually, the life is a challenge: it isn't easy to you. To me, the students should be a good citizen because the society needs them to develop. A good behavior is more necessary than graduation, and they have to practise or use the lesson that were learned in high school, so they will get a lot of experience.

The life is an adventure, discovery, and study. In my opinion, most of people fall down in their life because of lacking of experience.

In short, i support this idea because it make us mature, independent. At that time, he was learning how to grow a special coffee, which is the only one not only in vietnam but also over the world. At the present,

his company is the best coffee company in Vietnam. Sometimes, they woud like to become an independent person, so nobody can coerce to do something even their parent. Due to this problem, the student not only study in textbook, or document but also learn from substantial. It's also a good way to demonstrate your ability. If you graduate in high school early it will give you more time to learn new things from your life, so you will grow up and have a lot of opportunities to success in life. For instance, Generic_Name who i admired, was a founder the Coffee Shop Company in my country. He said to me that difficulty, experience are the keys to success. After graduating from high school, they are a good person, aren't they?. Besides, we have more chance to success and to do new things. In my eyes, it is not important that the students finish high school in three year or four year. From my point of view, this is a good idea because most students have a different situation in their life. He was still graduate high school early and then i worked for his company. I believe that 50% senior were confusing about their future because most of their time is in school, class, which forgot going ouside to expand your knowledge and doing some part-time jobs to get new lessons. If you would like subdue it you have to prepare everything as soon as you graduate high school",0
"Using the right verb can add clarity and accuracy to a sentence and help ensure that the intended meaning is accurately conveyed. Additionally, if the wrong verb is used in a legal or professional document (such as in a contract or court filing) the consequences can be especially dire, as wrong verb usage can potentially invalidate the document and lead to further scrutiny and allegations of fraud. 
Verbs are an essential part of the English language and play a key role in our writing. 

For example, if a sentence states that someone ""ran quickly"" instead of ""sprinted quickly,"" the reader may assume the subject was running at a leisurely pace. However, using the wrong verb can cause confusion and misinterpretation, which can lead to miscommunication. While simply using the wrong verb will not always lead to detrimental results, it is important to understand the potential consequences of such errors and to take the necessary steps to ensure verb accuracy when composing any document.. 

In conclusion, it is critical to always use the correct verb when writing. This example highlights why it is important to use the correct verb in writing, which can be done by being thoughtful with one's word choice and referencing a dictionary if a certain verb is not certain.

On the other hand, if the wrong verb is used on purpose or with the intention to deceive the reader, then the consequences of using the wrong verb can be much more serious",1
"Finally, working alone can also be more efficient, as there is no need to compromise or resolve conflict.

Ultimately, working alone can be the best choice for students. It provides the freedom and flexibility to explore new ideas while still allowing a person to gain the skills they need to succeed in the future. Additionally, there is always the possibility of conflicting opinions within the group, which can lead to group conflict and wasted time.

On the other hand, working alone offers several advantages. It also encourages teamwork skills, which will be important for future workplaces. It can foster individual creativity, as working without the opinions of others provides the opportunity for a person to create something truly unique and original. It also acts as a great stress reliever and builds up mental strength, as it gives a person a chance to focus on their own ideas, plan their own projects, and draw inspiration from their own experiences. 
Working alone and working in groups each have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Working in groups can be good for brainstorming and problem solving, as it allows a team to come up with more solutions and ideas through collaboration and sharing. However, it can also be a challenge, as a team must be able to trust each other and compromise to reach an agreement. Working alone also reduces the amount of stress associated with group dynamics and enhances the learning experience for the individual.",1

Creating an after-school homework club at our school could be a great way to help students succeed. 

One challenge is finding a way to recruit and introduce students to the club. We could use word of mouth, as well as flyers, email, and other methods of advertisement.

Another issue is keeping the club going. If students are able to improve their skills as a result of involvement in the club, this can result in higher test scores, improved grades, and ultimately increase our school's reputation. We could maintain and increase interest and commitment with regular meetings, competitions, and rewards. It could also create a ripple effect throughout our local community, which could have a lasting effect.. Any program requires long-term commitment and a vision for the future. While there are potential challenges to creating and running such a club, potential solutions exist. Students need to be made aware of the club and its agenda, and also understand that it is a safe and supportive environment. We could seek help from teachers and administrators, as well as community organizations and businesses that may be willing to contribute resources.

Creating an after-school homework club not only offers students the support and guidance they need for their long-term academic success, but it can also have a significant impact on our school's overall performance. Having a broad and engaging agenda would help to keep students motivated.

Finally, an important challenge is finding resources and help for running the club. Research demonstrates that students who have extra support with their homework can improve their academic performance over the long-term",1
"Without our imagination, we would be stuck in an unchangeable world, unable to adapt to the knowledge of the present.  . 
One of the greatest aspects of the human condition is our capacity for imagination. Imagination is the driving force behind the advancement of humanity, because without it, progress would be impossible. Simply put, imagination is a fundamental element of knowledge. Without imagination, knowledge is not only static, but limited. This ability to creatively explore alternatives allows us to develop informed strategies based on our own inner wisdom. In our daily life, imagination plays a critical role in every decision we make and every idea we conceive. From selecting the right job to supporting our family, our imagination gives us the capacity to create scenarios and visualize the outcomes of various actions",1
"Even in the toughest of circumstances, Gandhi stayed true to his convictions, which is a strong reflection of Emerson's sentiment.

Another example would be the renowned scientist Marie Curie. Despite immense pressure to conform to the oppressive colonial rule of the British, Gandhi chose to stay true to his beliefs and values, leading India to independence without any bloodshed. Despite living in a society that championed men’s scientific contributions over those of women, Curie continued to follow her passion for science and influenced many modern discoveries. He argues that in a world that is constantly suggesting changes in order to fit in, being true to one's own self is an incredibly difficult, yet highly rewarding accomplishment. It is through the accomplishments of these inspiring individuals, as well as countless others, that we can understand the truth of Emerson's quote: that to be yourself - despite any obstacles that may arise - is truly the greatest accomplishment.. She was incredibly successful in her field and gained recognition in a time where women were largely underrepresented in the field of science and were actively discouraged to explore their true potential.

These examples demonstrate the strength of Emerson's quote, as both Gandhi and Curie succeeded despite the attempts of the outside world to shape and mould them into something they were not. 

One real-life example that serves as an embodiment of Emerson's quote is Mahatma Gandhi. 
Our understanding of the world is never static and is constantly shifting and evolving, and Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote reflects this",1

Cell phones have become ingrained in our lives, providing unparalleled opportunities for connection and resources. Furthermore, with the growing prevalence of cyberbullying in schools, having access to a cell phone can provide a student with a sense of safety and security to alert adults and authorities in the face of potential danger.

Overall, allowing the use of cell phones in school is a move towards greater connection and academic support. Additionally, with the addition of cloud storage, cell phones can be an efficient way for students to easily organize and store notes, assignments, and other documents.

Aside from educational uses, cell phones can provide an important source of connection and support. From calculator apps for complex equations to interactive dictionaries for foreign language studies, cell phones have a wide variety of useful functions for bolstering a student’s educational pursuits. In a high-pressure academic environment, staying in touch with family and friends can be a key factor in the success and wellbeing of a student. 

Cell phones can assist in a student’s learning, providing useful tools for classroom activities. With the necessary safety measures and policies in place, permitting the use of cell phones can be a crucial step to providing students with the best possible learning environment.. Therefore, with the right safeguards, it is both feasible and beneficial to allow the use of cell phones in school",1
"
Character traits can be extremely important when it comes to tackling a variety of different situations. For example, one may need to be patient and understanding when in the home, confident and productive when in the job, or collaborative and respectful when in the school. When entering different environments - such as the home, the job, or the school - it is important to choose character traits that fit the situation. Choosing the right character trait in any situation can also be key to success. Having the flexibility and ability to assess any situation and choose character traits that are most appropriate can improve a person's chances of achieving their goals. Ultimately, having the capacity to accurately select and demonstrate the right character traits in any environment can be a huge advantage.",1
"Some opponents also argue that it is unfair to force extra-curricular activities upon students who may not have the same financial or social resources to devote to them.

At the end of the day, the evaluation of these arguments must come down to the priority and best interests of the students. Evaluating the arguments in this light suggests that mandatory extra-curricular activity may not be the best option for all students. Opponents, however, contend that mandatory extra-curricular activities are too burdensome to students, especially when paired with the already heavy academic load that many students face. 

Proponents of mandatory extra-curricular activities believe that such activities benefit students by teaching them valuable skills needed for success in the real world, such as teamwork, time management, and communication. Therefore, mandatory extra-curricular activities should only be encouraged in cases where students are both interested in and able to properly participate.. However, with proper school and parental support, it could be a valuable opportunity for those interested in and capable of participating. They also believe the activities give students a sense of pride and school spirit, while giving them a chance to explore new interests and meet new people",1
"However, if a want the opportituti to do something in the future the best choie is to study effort my self and go to the college to have a better jod.

people Sometimes they're bussy in keys that is something posible in us life becuse we want to become a good person and resposible in the future that's that way we learn it is easy to do something never give up.. In my position do work it's some i like to do every day because that's how i learn more stuff. they said that becsause they never think about thre future or maybe they don't want to do nothing in the life and that is not going to work. IF we have a park time after school that is something good because you are reciving money for your self and maybe you can help your parent with bills.

Some peoples think that if we don't do something in this life we ca have a vetter remposible. for exaple I have a lot stuff to do for gratuade from hight school i have to pass my esol and have a good great grade if i don't graduate from hight school that choise i have is to work out side. I agree with this prompt becasause it's something posible and if we always doing something.

In my opinion we acomplish more if we are always doing something because some times we have stuff to do for example going to work after school or study after school. Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle"" that is mean like some time we are busy. But some time people they don't like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. This is something posible we can do in us life.

Some may said that to do nothing is better life. That is mean if we don't work or study for a vetter life them we are not going to have nothing for .Exaplem if you are

18 or more you have to look for a jod becase you are respomsible for your self because your parents there are not going to give you anything what you want you have to work and buy your own stuff",0

While there, I had the opportunity to work side by side with computer engineers to develop innovative software products and find solutions to complex computer problems",1
it also helps with safety too if there was something going down like a robbery or a shooting adults will probaly try yo protect the younger kids and than when some adults see some kids by themeselves they will see other adults and run to protect more kids. . is setting an good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people or are there better ways too influence others my opinion is that setting a good example can influence other people around you why because if they see you do something good they might catch on and say oh since he was being nice im start doing the same thing and start doing good deeds and that will help others because than people will start catching on and start being to nice to everyone. and if your in school and you went to class and show up on time teachers can use you as an example for coming in on time being ready to do your work and people will look up tp that and say i want my teacher to use me as an example and start doing the same thing they'll be on time and ready to do there work. your setting example for the younger kids because most of the kids look up to there older siblings saying when i grow up i want to be like them so setting an example for the youth or anybody is great,0
"Working in a group encourages people to learn from each other and to share both their commonalities and differences. One major benefit is the exchange of cultural knowledge between group members. Furthermore, the effectiveness of group work in terms of learning has been demonstrated to be higher when compared to learning on an individual basis. On the other hand, one of the disadvantages of working with a group is that it can be time consuming and can lead to teamwork issues if proper guidelines are not followed.. It also encourages the development of communication and language skills, as it provides an often fun environment to practice the use of language in different contexts. Working with a group also provides support to each group member, as individuals learn from each other and share experiences. 
When it comes to working with a group, there are several benefits",1
"I think the effects of older and younger students working together is good because i think that the students can help each other in many things and if a younger student is getting picked on then maybe the older student can defend them and i just think that if older and younger students are paired up then they can work together and help each other on things outside of school. Also the older student can possibly be an influence to the younger student like for example if the older student wants to be a doctor then maybe, just maybe, the younger student can be influenced and wants to be a doctor when the student is older.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      . And maybe one of the older student can become really good friends with the younger one. I think that all schools should have programs like this because then the younger student can learn from the older one. I really think that students are smarter when they are with other students that are not in there age group. I think that older and younger students being together is a really good idea cause that means that the older student can help the younger student and If an older students needs help with something one of the younger students can possibly help. I honestly think that schools that have programs like this are really good cause students can cooperate with each other and work together and maybe become friends",0
"Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong.

Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. The key is work hard do not Give Up.

In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. Hard working pays you back!

Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard.

First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. Which means they become well to do when they born. For instant knowledge. I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate.

Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. Now adays tecnology descover the world. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. He is working hard like us. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for.

Which means works are the rode to get our dreams",0

If i go and do all of this i would never forget about it. I could learn how to speak Portuguese, I can find out how Brazilian food is or i could even learn how to make it. I would want to try it because I never had it. I could even ask for directions if i didnt know where i was going.

I would like to try out Brazilian food.                         . I would try to make it because I could make it at home and never forget about my experience with Brazilian food.

I would like to go and see the Fantastic Parade in Brazil. I would always remember the good times i had in Brazil. I would even go and see one of the famous parades held in Brazil, one of my friends went to Brazil to see the parade and he said ""It was beautiful."" Going to Brazil would be great.

I would like to learn Portuguese because I could get along with the people and even be friends with them. I would see it and take many pictures and never forget about it. It would want to know how it taste and if i like it i would try to learn how to make some of their foods. Generic_Name

"You look up to him as an idol because, of what he accomplished in his lifetime. Something we all have in common is character traits, without it our lives would be meaningless we would not achieve nothing big or anything to be proud of. But we can always change our character traits, it's similar to an opinion on something or someone. Mainly because adults have a lot of things to worry and take care of, their character traits can cost them to miss out on big opportunities like a job or a promotion. In fact, adults have a hard time choosing character traits. You either wanna be like Kobe or be better than him. we decide if we want to be happy or sad,making good and bad decisions all those are character traits that we choose with our minds.

Lets say you are inspired by Kobe Bryant. Ever since, we were kids we started choosing our own character traits. it can be good or bad based of the environment we live in, how we were raised, and personal experiences. Our lives are based off the character traits that we choose.. That right there is a character trait, the ability to choose who influences us by what they have accomplished. We choose who influence us. Unlike,most kids that dont care about the consequences nor judgments, kids usually choose careless traits but as they get older and become adults, they realized their mistakes and they choose traits with precautions. Some people believe we can't choose our character traits because we did not decide nor choose the way we wanted to be born, we did not choose if we wanted to be tall, short, black, white etc.. But, they miss the fact that character trait is not about the things we can't change, its about the things we can change and decide for ourselves to become a better person or be like someone who influenced us.

Choosing character traits is not an easy task for everyone",0
"In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.

Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.

It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them.

Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.

As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.

Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Those were my .. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesn't have any and stays at home playing video games. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.

However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work",0
"Having a positive outlook in day-to-day life can cause positive ripples that affect both the individual and those around them. Additionally, the positive attitudes of other people can be incredibly motivating and encouraging. Experts believe that having a positive attitude is key for students who want to make the most of their academic and professional careers. 

Having a positive attitude is essential to success in life. By having a positive attitude, it is easier to set achievable goals and maintain motivation to strive towards them. By changing the way one thinks and approaching situations in a more constructive manner, it is possible to open up more opportunities for success. Ultimately, having a positive attitude is invaluable for leading a fulfilled life.",1
"Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes.

Lastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit.

In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits.

In conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. . In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course.

Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just won't show up that whole school day. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take",0
"All children have different interests and curiosities, and by allowing families to choose which extracurricular activities are right for their children, it allows children to explore the activities that genuinely appeal to their individual needs and desires. This understanding gives them the best knowledge of what activities will best benefit their child, which a school may lack. 

Overall, extracurricular activities should be a decision left up to families, not schools. Families often work together closely to decide which activities are right for their children, building an increased sense of communication and trust between the parent and child. Although many would argue that it is the schools' responsibility to provide activities for students, there are several reasons why families should make this decision. Allowing families to make this decision ensures that the child participates in activities that are tailored to his or her interests and abilities, strengthens the bond between the family, and provides the family with the most intimate knowledge of their own child.. 

First, extracurricular activities are often highly personal. 
As educational institutions and lawmakers look for ways to improve students' academic success, there is intense debate over whether student involvement in extracurricular activities should be mandated by schools or left up to each individual family. 

Finally, when extracurricular involvement is decided by the family, it brings the family closer together. 

Second, the family has the strongest ties to the child, and deep knowledge of the child's abilities and goals",1
"With social media, people can now stay connected with their friends and family members regardless of where they are in the world. Movie streaming services have made it possible for people to watch their favorite films on any device, anytime, anywhere. With online stores, shoppers can now purchase items from the comfort of their own homes. Shopping, for example, is no longer an out-and-about experience. Technology has made it easier for people to stay connected and share experiences, creating new opportunities for social interaction.. 
Technology has drastically changed the way people interact with each other and conduct their everyday activities. The same goes for movie-going. Finally, technology has also changed the way people engage in social activities",1
"Additionally, being in a play can be very beneficial in the future as it may open up opportunities to act in other plays or even in films. Taking on new roles and studying how to approach them can be beneficial to your development as an actor. Therefore, you should take into account the benefits associated with being in a play and how it could help you reach your goals.. 
Acting can be a very rewarding and fulfilling experience. Being involved in a play can also give you a sense of satisfaction and satisfaction as you are able to share your talents with an audience. Being in play can allow you to explore different emotions and roles, while also providing an opportunity to develop your acting skills. To become a successful actor, you must be dedicated and hardworking in order to achieve fame",1
"Furthermore, people have become dependent on technology as a crutch--they utilize it as a way to feel connected with others, even when they don't have any real human contact. 
In today's modern world, technology is an integral part of everyone's lives. From the social media platforms that people use to stay connected with others to the devices that allow us to work from anywhere in the world, technology has undeniably reshaped the way that people communicate. This disrupts the natural cycle of social interactions and disconnects people from reality, making it difficult for them to form meaningful relationships with others.

My own personal experience has demonstrated the importance of human contact in maintaining one's mental and physical well-being. And while the use of technology will always be necessary in our lives, we must remember to prioritize real human interaction as an essential component of our health and well-being.. When I was stuck at home last year due to the pandemic, virtually every interaction I had was through a laptop or phone screen, and I really started to feel the negative effects of it. Without it, people do not get the validation and emotional support that they need in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. Unfortunately, this has led to the limitation of physical human contact, which has had numerous negative impacts on people's health.

Recent studies have found that people who spend less time engaging in face-to-face, social interactions are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. But why is that? Simply put, it's because physical interaction is necessary for human connection. I found myself anxious and overwhelmed, and I often felt lonely and isolated. It was only when I was able to get out of the house and meet with a few friends in-person that I was able to gain back my sense of control and calm my frazzled nerves",1
"In order to be truly successful, the two must work together - knowledge must inform imagination, and imagination must inform knowledge. 
When considering the importance of knowledge and imagination in our day-to-day lives, it becomes clear that both are essential for success in both individual and collective endeavours. 

To summarise, imagination and knowledge are both essential for success in life and in teamwork. Knowledge provides the structure and boundaries for our actions, whilst imagination can help to push boundaries and create something new. The application of knowledge, such as scientific facts and figures, an understanding of history and culture, and awareness of technical skills, can provide a solid foundation for decision-making. . For example, as part of a successful team the knowledge gained in formal education can be beneficial in terms of brainstorming methods and strategies for solving problems. Imagination is perhaps best understood as the ability to think creatively and to think outside the box. For instance, imagining new and innovative ideas to drive a successful business is only possible when one has the appropriate knowledge - knowledge of the relevant legislation, of best practices, and of the industry. When used in combination, the results can be remarkable and far-reaching. Often it is the ability to imagine solutions that can be the difference between failure and success. 

But knowledge alone is not enough to drive progress and success",1
"The goal should be to provide options that still provide nutritional benefits, without sacrificing the taste and enjoyment for students. 
One of the steps that can be taken to make school lunches more enjoyable for students is to serve fresher, healthier foods. 

By taking these steps, schools can create more enjoyable and nutritionally sound lunch options for their students.. For example, healthier versions of macaroni and cheese, pizza, and taco dishes can be created that retain the traditional flavor profile while providing a nutrient-rich meal. 

To address the potential consequence of removing popular items from school lunch menus, alternative foods can be offered as substitutes. This can be achieved by including more fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as wholesome whole grains, lean proteins, and other healthful components. Additionally, school lunches should be prepared in a safe and hygienic manner, with kitchen staff following best practices of sanitizing and cooking food thoroughly",1
"

Technology can also provide numerous benefits for students depending on their learning needs. 

However, it is important to discuss both the pros and cons of digital device use in the classroom. This is why appropriate parameters must be established so students use the technology for educational purposes only. 

When looking at how cell phones and other digital devices are used in the classroom, it is important to be aware of the potential issues while also recognizing their potential to help students learn.. For example, auditory learners could use devices for podcasts and other audio exercises, while visual learners may benefit from watching videos and interacting with interactive slides. This can come in the form of word processing apps, language translations, and other software that can explain and define complex words and terms. Their major benefit is to provide students with a range of tools and resources to help them understand new material. Teachers can also create activities to get students to engage with their phones to facilitate discussion and debate. While students have more opportunities to explore concepts, there can be issues concerning distraction and cheating. 
As technology continues to evolve, cell phones and digital devices have been integrated into the classroom more than ever before",1
"However, it is important to use it in the right way, responsibly, to avoid the negative effects that can result from using it improperly.. 

We can use technology to stay in touch with family and friends, to wrangle our schedules and even to conduct our work. Technology can even enable us to pay bills online or send money to others. 

However, when technology is used in the wrong way, negative effects can result. 
Technology has become a ubiquitous part of our day-to-day lives, but how we use it can have a considerable impact on our lives. Too much information can easily be shared online, and people can be victims of cyberbullying or identity theft. People can become reliant on technology at the expense of relationships, face-to-face interactions, and physical activities. It can also be used to help us stay informed about current events and even explore and learn new skills. There are many ways that we can use technology in positive, beneficial ways that enrich our lives and create opportunities and conveniences. 

In conclusion, people can use technology in positive ways, which can open up a world of possibilities and opportunities. It can be used to store memories, inspire creativity, or plan trips. People can unknowingly browse and access websites that may be harmful or disrespectful to others",1
"In some situations when something bad is happening out side your home is better to stay as far away as you can and do'not intervene is better to stay idle.

Finally,I some occasions is inactivity serves a purpose. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. If I'am inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. Like a personal trainer or a coach.

Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. In some people's life activity play's a major role in there life's. Being active or doing something all the time is good. You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. You do accomplish more if you stay active and you can meat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.. That's why it's better to be active.

Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. My thought on the prompt are that I think it's better to be active. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise.

I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself",0
"Eating healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients to maximize energy and focus for game practice.. For students with busy family and school commitments, stress and fatigue can interfere with their ability to practice for a game. It is important to manage time effectively in order to make time for practicing, however a good diet can also help. 
Excerpt:

Without proper sleep and nutrition, students can suffer from serious health complications that could impair their ability to practice and compete in games",1
"With students gaining an advantage from these classes and engaging with local businesses, both students and businesses can grow and develop together. 
As the business world evolves, so does the way in which students are able to gain hands-on experience and learn best practices from industry professionals. With the help of technology, businesses are able to connect with students in an efficient and convenient manner, allowing each party to benefit from the partnership.

For young students, these partnerships can be extremely valuable, providing them with experience and insight into the world of business. Through partnerships and business classes, students can gain valuable experience and set themselves up for success in future employment.. Through student-company partnerships, schools across the nation are introducing students to opportunities to engage with real businesses and explore the professional world. Having direct access to professionals in the field can provide a real-world education which no traditional classroom can offer. Furthermore, businesses can benefit from these partnerships, as they can build potential relationships with experienced employees who have already gained the knowledge and skills necessary for success.

On top of that, schools are beginning to offer classes in entrepreneurship and business which equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to understand the industry",1
"
Confidence is an important factor when it comes to achieving anything—whether it is in our personal or professional lives. An entrepreneur may forgo a promising opportunity out of fear of failure because they lack self-confidence. It is the all-important catalyst that helps us to move forward with our goals, despite the odds. When we don’t believe in ourselves, we may doubt our potential and give up on our ambitions. Having confidence in oneself gives us the motivation and drive to strive for what we want in life, even when the odds are against us. They will be encouraged to keep going and stay motivated because of their internal belief in their skills.

On the other hand, lacking confidence can lead to a negative attitude towards achieving goals. This would lead to missed opportunities and ultimately, leads to an unfulfilled life.

In conclusion, for any achievements—big or small—self-confidence is the key. Without it, we may lack the necessary drive to see our aspirations through.. For example, an aspiring author may be confident in their abilities to write a book, even if they don’t have any published works yet. This raises the question of whether having self-confidence before achieving a goal or experience is necessary for our success.

I believe that having self-confidence is the first step of all achievers, big or small. With self-confidence, we can stay motivated and persevere in the pursuit of our goals",1
"

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]. Of course, B range students can benefit from these activities too, but by limiting participation to those students, the school is denying C range students an opportunity to experience the positive effects of sports and team-based activities.

Secondly, allowing C range students to participate in teams and other activities could help to break down stigmas and encourage greater inclusivity throughout the school. Activities such as sports and other team-based events can provide students with a great sense of success and accomplishment, and can also act as a valuable form of stress relief. By changing the policy to allow all students to participate, regardless of their grades, it could positively impact the school environment and promote a sense of social solidarity amongst students.

In conclusion, I am advocating for the school to change its policy to a C range for teams and other activities. This will ensure that all students, regardless of grades, are able to experience the benefits of teamwork and physical activity, and will also help to create a more inclusive environment. 

Firstly, by only allowing B range students, the school is inadvertently preventing many C range students from participating in activities that could prove beneficial to their mental and physical wellbeing. The current policy may suggest to C range students that they are not good enough to participate in certain activities, and this can negatively affect their sense of self-worth and belonging. I am proposing that the policy should be changed to C range, and I have two reasons to support this argument. 
    
Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to express my concern over the school's policy of only allowing B range students on teams and other activities",1

Graduating high school in three years instead of four has become a more popular option for many students; however, this can be associated with several drawbacks. Moreover, the intensified workload can also result in greater stress for those attending school in three years rather than four.

Despite the potential drawbacks, remaining in school for four years can have considerable advantages. Having an extra year of high school allows more time to hone academic interests, thus increasing college readiness. It also allows students to take more elective courses, partake in extracurricular activities, and take part in college preparation activities such as test prep and college visits. For those taking this path, the fast-tracked schedule means having less time for family activities, elective classes that are outside of general academic subjects, and college preparation activities such as SAT and ACT prep as well as college admissions visits. Graduating after four years of high school also gives students more time to appreciate their high school experience and make lifelong memories.",1
"Consequently, lack of kindness can also lead to a lifetime of distrust and alienation from family and friends. 

Overall, an understanding of both the positive and negative effects that kindness can have on others is paramount to establishing meaningful connections and relationships. It's important to understand that when we show kindness to others, we can also benefit from it as well.

On the other hand, neglecting to show kindness can have significant negative consequences. 
The power of kindness should not be underestimated – it has countless positive effects and advantages that people often overlook. Perhaps the most important benefit of all is that it can have a lasting positive impact on all involved. People who live without kindness tend to feel alone, anxious and like they don't belong, leaving them with a sense of unease and helplessness. Such knowledge can help people use kindness as a powerful tool for building bridges and achieve more harmonious communities.. On the flip side, a lack of kindness from acquaintances or family members can leave someone feeling lost and without a support system, which can have a permanent effect on their view of themselves and the world. Kindness brings positive energy into any situation and helps to build strong, meaningful relationships with those around us. 

For example, a small act of kindness from a stranger can make a person feel appreciated and noticed, which can further impact their lives in a positive way",1
"

To ensure that students can continue to meet their academic responsibilities without sacrificing important sleep, it would be beneficial to explore different alternatives to the extra hour and a half. Many students already feel overwhelmed with a full day of classes and after-school activities, and such a lengthy school day would only exacerbate that feeling. For instance, school boards could consider offering extra periods, or “modules,” throughout the year, outside of the traditional school day, to give students the opportunity to focus on their studies. Between homework time, extracurriculars, and sleep, something would inevitably have to be cut from the equation and most likely it would be needed sleep. 
Adding an extra hour and a half to the school day could have a drastic impact on students’ ability to complete homework and get enough sleep. Furthermore, the extra hour and a half would undoubtedly cut into the amount of time students would have to spend on their homework. By spreading out the extra hour and a half rather than compressing it into the regular school day, students could continue to earn credit for classes while avoiding the potential pitfalls of excessive school days.",1
"
Honesty is vital in creating a strong foundation for relationships. However, being too honest in some situations can have negative consequences such as causing unnecessary hurt. When both partners agree to always tell the truth, there is a sense of trust that is established that feeds companionship and understanding. Honesty is important, but so is withholding harsh truths or sugarcoating situations in a way that preserves your relationship and your partner's feelings. In relationships, being thoughtful and understanding when it comes to honesty can make all the difference.",1
"One should not make a big problem with the laws and the constitution of the schools. It is obligatory of the student need to take the high school for four year that is most better and continue with the traditional four years of school. . For some people that is not a good idea to finish the High School in three year, because in another part is not agreeable and unjust for some student who study for four year to see something new, so this is disagree because the students need to study four year in High School.

Finish the high school in three year is a big bad idea because is to short to finish the high school,

and another parts some students don't wants to go more to the school so they choose that new program for a short year to graduate in high school.

The other parts is not for all High schools to finish in three year, so is most better to delete that program and cancel about to finish the high school in three year and the students who follow that program they need to take the normal high school. To change the new program for all high school of the country is not easy, because some schools don't agree to doing that so is most better to continue the traditional four years.

If they change that program for all schools of the country they have a big responsibility about that, because most of

High Schools they have a big problem and work for example to change like that credit for graduate to the high school, the SOL text so is not a very good idea to doing that.

The conclusion, this is the best option, is to follow the rules of the schools",0
"College will give me the right educational path to confidently pursue any goal.

Part 2:
By going to college, I could realize a variety of opportunities, such as becoming a famous chef, getting a job, or even becoming a professional sports player. Moreover, to climb the ladder of success, I must know how to apply what I have learned and excel in whatever field of endeavor I choose. 
Part 1:
Attaining an education is paramount to achieving my future aspirations. Furthermore, college also provides tuition assistance, grants and scholarships giving students the opportunity to gain financial aid for their education. Additionally, college offers the opportunity to broaden my social network, thereby opening up possibilities. College offers the necessary skills and resources that will provide me with the competencies to learn how to handle myself in a professional environment. . 

Part 3:
Financially, college can open up a wealth of resources to one’s disposal. From a source of professional contacts to networking events, college provides access to financial and job opportunities that one cannot otherwise access. College also provides me a chance to meet new people, participate in challenging activities, take on new adventures, as well as expand my understanding of the world around me",1
"

However, working with a team or group of people can present its own set of challenges. 

Educational activities can have both positive and negative outcomes when it comes to learning, socializing, and making friends. In order to manage these differences, it is important to agree on a few ground rules in advance. These could include respecting individual points of view, having an open and honest discussion where every opinion is heard, and communicating clearly with each other. In addition, these activities can be a great way to make friends and broaden social networks. Setting these boundaries can help ensure that educational activities can be a positive and rewarding experience.. On the one hand, participating in educational activities can have a range of benefits. Disagreements and arguments are common, and it can be difficult for everyone to share an opinion without offending someone else. It can develop important communication and team-building skills, promote problem-solving abilities, and foster creativity and critical thinking",1
"A positive attitude may also lead to a greater respect for one another in the classroom, as one may be more understanding and open to the ideas and opinions of their peers. A positive attitude can help build confidence by providing a sense of control and allowing one to remain optimistic. All in all, having a positive attitude can have a powerful impact on one's academic success.. 
Having a positive attitude as a student can have many positive benefits. This can lead to improved productivity, better relationships with peers and teachers, and better grades. With confidence, students may better believe in their ability to accomplish their goals",1
"What I had previously considered to be so far out of my reach became something that I could actually achieve. I also observed colleagues who had already mastered one skill and moved onto learning another. With each new challenge I tackle, I am reminded of the possibilities that await.. Suddenly, learning something new felt easier, as I had a solid foundation that I could build from.

To continue learning, I adopted strategies such as breaking down large problems into smaller ones, reviewing the solutions to challenges others had faced and expanding my horizons by learning new coding languages. They taught themselves entirely new concepts and achieved amazing results.

The mastery of something not only gave me confidence, but also encouraged me to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can learn and what I can do. 
As I began to master the basics of coding, I realized that I had a newfound confidence in my abilities",1
"Because now the students now how much does the career cost, and where he can go studied when he finish high school. also high school has a lot opportunities, for students that wants to take collage course. And see if there are others career that students would like to take.    . But there are many students that take career just to take them but thats no the career they like so they end it up not achieving nothing.

In high school, is where a lot of students work so they can get money and buy what they want and Also to pay their college career. But there are many students, that don't care about their futures, others don't think about their futures in high school. Those courses can help, because it teach the student the things that he needs to learn therefore hes prepare the career, he wants to take. Because the student can get their mind set and think about what courses the student wants to take in high school. So thats why committing to a career by the time you get to high school helps you, have more time to view different careers and choose the one u like the best.

Many student that are almost in high school, think about how high school going to be like. And also to be able to search where the he wants to go studied and pick the collage that teach the best for his career.

And finally preparing for a career before high school, gives the students more opportunities. So it helps committing to a career before going to high school it can get you prepare for your future. So I agree for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. And acomplish what you want for your future. Students that go to high school are expecting to do more work and be with a different mind set. Going to high school, is the time when students need to think what they want to do in the future, and pick a career that they like. For the time students get to high school, Is time for the students to focus more on their future. So identify a career by the time students get to high school help. So they can be prepare for their careers, and when they get to collage they now a lot about the career they want to take. So been able to choose a career before high school helps. Also to pick a career that you like,and you enjoy doing it. High school is the time when students are able to get focus and think about a career they wanna take. Also choosing a career when your young helps, because students have more time to get more information, about the career",0
"Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student don't want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some parents don't want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools.

Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision.

Lastly, some student don't want to stay after school program or any other activities. . If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then it's up to their families choice, but most of students don't want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. Although, many people believe that extracurricular activities can enrich students educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study and complete their homework assignments. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldn't made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student don't want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities.

First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents don't wants to do the extracurricular activities. Some student don't want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents.

This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities",0

Although being courageous and sure of one's identity is a personal accomplishment, having help from school, teachers, and groups helps in forming an independent and strong personality. Having assistance is beneficial to remain true to oneself in a world that may strive to make us something else.. Teachers are essential mentors who can impart not only educational knowledge, but also valuable advice and life lessons. Sharing advice or personal stories can provide the support and validation that is required to remain confident and sure of oneself in a trying environment. However, the struggle to remain true to oneself should not be done alone. While it is a personal journey, having assistance and guidance from school, teachers, and groups can be invaluable. It is important to not only accept help but to also understand that no one can manage on their own. This can help someone understand the different points of view that exist and have a respectful, well-rounded opinion. 

Schools provide a place to acquire knowledge, debate, and learn about different lifestyles and cultures. 
    Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement emphasizes the importance of being true to one's self despite the external pressures that society can impose. In the face of conformity, standing out can be daunting and it can be difficult to trust one's own instincts or opinions. Talking to peers or joining a group can provide a forum of people who are often living or experiencing similar issues",1

Student-mentor programs can be extremely beneficial for young people. These programs provide a sense of community and camaraderie, allowing mentors and mentees to engage and learn from each other.

Moreover, student-mentor programs can help students to develop emotional maturity and positive behavior in school. Mentors can act as role models while providing support and resources to far better create an environment conducive to growth and development. The guidance that mentors provide can help to prepare young people to become competent and socially responsible learners in society. Not only do they provide mentees with an experienced and knowledgeable adult who can offer guidance and help them to gain confidence, but it also gives mentors an opportunity to share their wisdom and insight. Thus, student-mentor programs are not only important, but they also have a lasting impact on both mentors and mentees.",1
"When we first meet people we see their first impressions and we see on how they are or we check on how their behavior is. First impressions is what I learn from many people. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. Impressions are something you can't change from people.. First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them.

Everybody is unique in many different ways. I think it's impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it.

Some people don't understand that some people can't change even if its for the better or the worse some people will just always be the same. People have many impressions and yes it is hard to change.

Impressions are special to some people but it also could effect people in certain ways. We all have a instict on where we look at some people and judge but we also see the attitude in the people. Ways where your whole behavior might change or attitude or maybe your whole person",0
"Learning how to regulate the temperature for plants is essential for their growth and development. 
After hours of researching pet daycares, I learned about the level of care they provide to our beloved animals, including not only food and water but also plenty of physical and mental stimulation in forms of indoor activities and access to outdoor space. 

Animals such as fish require a certain balance of water temperature, pH, and salinity among other variables to remain healthy, which must be taken into account when creating a home for them. 

The living conditions for plants depend on a number of variables, including temperature, levels of soil moisture and nutrients, and light intensity. 

Lastly, for individuals interested in becoming a swimming teacher or lifeguard, I learned that other certifications and qualifications may be required, including first aid and CPR certification, lifesaving abilities, and aquatic instructor certification.",1
"We can become a target for bullying or mockery if we express our opinions openly and honestly. On the other hand, remaining true to ourselves can be incredibly liberating. We may face criticism or disapproval from others, or be excluded from certain social circles. Additionally, it can be difficult to remain true to ourselves when faced with peer pressure or when around people who don’t have the same values.

Overall, being true to oneself in a world trying to make us someone else can be a challenging yet rewarding journey. We can take pride in our authentic selves, rather than being a clone of what society expects us to be. 
Being true to oneself in today's world can be difficult, but it can also be very rewarding. Having the strength to stand against the tide and remain true to ourselves can be the greatest victory of all.. It allows us to stand out from the crowd, to be seen and heard, and to express who we truly are.

The primary advantage of being true to ourselves is that we can make sure our choices are based on our own values and beliefs. This can increase our self-esteem and strengthen our confidence, allowing us to face life with more courage and positivity.

The primary disadvantage of being true to oneself is that it means going against the grain. Our authenticity is ours and ours alone – something that no one else can take away from us. On the one hand, society has a lot of pressures and expectations placed upon us, which can make it difficult to stay true to our values and beliefs",1
"Now working by yourself gives you more benefits like, no one is going to steal your ideas or just copy what you do or write about which happens a lot when you are working with a team.

Working with a group is more like team work, is more like people doing less, what i mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each others and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of yourself, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping you

Working with a group is not too bad but it can be, me as a student i do like to work with my friends but they always copying me which i do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me. Working with a group or working by yourself.

There is nothing more beneficial than to have a team work, having to work with people that you like, and the people that know what to do; is one of the best thing that could ever happen to you. It makes me feel like i can do more without having to need help from others.

In this world i have learned so much things, i have learned that you need to put you first, you need to think about you first, also that you need to have your own back. and my answer is that you should never feel useless, you should always think about yourself. Is sad the way they always have to be in a team to be a better person in life, which is not fair because some times they are not even the person that did the work.

I prefer to work alone better than to work with a team, is not like i do not like to work with other people; that is just how i am. When i work with other people i feel like it doesn't benefits me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. Working with a group in my opinion is something that should never happen, you might be asking why?. ",0
"More is always done when we do what we need to do, other wise we get lazy and say ""I'll do it tommorow"". So we have to get stuff done so we won't have to worry or stress about it later. They both worked so hard for their companys, not waiting a day for something to be complete. When we dont do anything get stressed out, and worry about it to much, more then we're suppose to. A couple of years later Apple came to be to what it is today, Steve Jobs worked hard to get his company to where is today, by working hard and not by doing nothing, but by always doing something. There are Entrepreneurs around the world that didnt wait to do something with themselves. Bill Gates was always busy doing something to get stuff done for a company, now he's the owner for Microsoft. Doing something will always bring positivity around you, into your life, another example is Steve Jobs. Around the world, there are people that accomplished alot, always by doing something, and not by doing nothing. We never know if tommorow will ever come for us to do the tasks that could be important. He stayed in a small garge, worked day and night to invent a computer, the MacBook, with this computer, he was going to become a famous Entrepreneur. to conclude my essay, we should always do something the moment we get the task, other wise it will never be done.. Doing nothing is easier then doing something, but doing nothing has a bigger consequence then doing something. Steve Jobs didnt wait to do something for himslef, he dropped out of college, but it didn't stop him from doing what he wanted to after that. It's good to have a mindset where you like to get stuff done, that shows that youre an honest person, and it can really say alot about a person. For example, Bill Gates, he is the richest man in the world with billions of dollars to his name,but how did he manage to get all that money? by doing something and not by doing nothing, doing what he needed to do, when it needed to be done, not waiting for tommorowto do the tacks that he needed to do to get where he is today. These two Entremreneurs are great examples of doing something, great should come. Doing nothing will not get anyhting done, neither will waiting. Steve Jobs is a great example of how much great can come by doing some",0
"You get your work done and you move on. Is that true?! Is that the case?! Well I am not sure about that, but what I do know is that I think we students should have the options to decide what we really are confortable with, and our parents should help us with that. Other students that gets in trouble all the time are just better off learning from home. Online or video conferencing are not so bad themself, I will have done if I have the opportunity to.. But not all of those kids are hard to deal with. What If It was so bad that I couldn't go to school?! Some students are just not good at school, and just prefer learning from home online or by video conferencing. all I can think of is what I provided. Do students that attand classes from home, ever cheet?! we'll never know if they do. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attand classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. We all need to turn in our work on time or it will be counted late, same test, same quiez everything. But this is what my attantion goes to. It is hard as a kid or a young teens to go to school and have to deal with other kids, and I get it, because it is hard for me to deal with other kids too. We all are doing the same work, depanding on our grades. There, at home, there is no one to to fit with. The only differance between people that are taking online or video conferencing from people at school is that they are not going to school. I would like an answer for my question, but I bet there will never have a proper answer.

There is a lot of resons why it is good for students to be able to take classes from home, and I will never be able to tell you all that resons. Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. We all have to studie for our test, quiez... Anyways, It's not like people at home are doing less work than people at school. They aren't in a classroom. their will be no more trouble.

Most of the times our parents say that going to school and socialism is good for us. Less take me as an example; I had personal problems before, and It was auwefull",0

Having an after school homework club offers significant advantages to students in their academics. For one, it helps them improve their grades, giving them the opportunity to receive support from tutors and peers in tackling difficult material. Finally, with the help from the club, students are less likely to forget assignments, allowing them to stay on top of their studies and remain organized.. It also allows students to better reach their educational goals, providing an extra layer of guidance and encouragement in improving their skills and understanding complex concepts",1
"Watching games, on the other hand, allows people to be more passive observers of the action, and can bring them closer together with others who share their passion for the same sport.

People shop for many reasons, and in several different environments. Elderly people who read non-fiction books increase their overall psychological wellbeing and reduce their stress levels.

Playing sports and watching games can both offer different advantages. The vast range of different clothes and cosmetics allows people to experiment with their appearance, discover their style, and find new products that they may not have been aware of before. Regular physical activity helps to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, while team sports can also help to foster personal connections and improve communication skills. 
Reading books has been found to offer many benefits for a variety of different groups. Shopping for necessities, such as food, often takes place in larger stores offering a wide selection, while shopping for luxury items often happens in more specialized boutique stores. Playing sports offers the potential for physical exercise, the opportunity to learn and improve skills, and the chance to build meaningful connections with peers. Moreover, adults who read for educational or professional purposes are also likely to improve their knowledge and understanding of the topic. Additionally, playing sports can be a great way to make new friends and improve social skills, while trying different activity can put people in new and exciting environments.

Shopping for clothing and beauty products is a great way for people to express themselves and be creative. Shopping can also provide a great opportunity to find bargains, making it a great way to save money.. People may also choose to shop online in order to browse a greater variety of products and take advantage of convenience.

Team sports can be appealing to some students, as it allows them to build relationships with other players, develop a sense of belonging, and have better communication skills. Team sports offer opportunities for personal growth, as students can learn from experienced coaches and players, work together to reach common goals, and learn how to work together in a team.

Playing sports can have many benefits, both for physical health and personal growth. For example, kids who read for enjoyment show better academic performance and develop better critical thinking skills",1
"It would help me to learn more about the ever-evolving medical field and new technologies, while at the same time invest in the future of healthcare by educating the next generation. Growing up, I was exposed to a number of medical professionals in my community who inspired me to pursue medicine as a career. I believe that partnering with the next generation to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration would be useful for both sides. 
 My interest in the medical field began at an early age. I cherish the knowledge I have learned and am driven to pass it onto the next generation. By providing mentorship, I hope to not only facilitate the learning of the new generation of medical professionals but also inspire others to pursue their dreams and ambitions.",1
"For non-traditional students, online courses also provide a more flexible option for taking courses as needed from any location. 
Taking a class in a classroom setting as opposed to taking one online can offer a variety of distinct benefits. 

In contrast, taking courses online can have its advantages as well. Courses online are often more convenient and can be taken at any time from the comfort of the student’s own home. However, depending on the subject material, taking courses in a classroom setting can offer its own unique and varied benefits that may prove invaluable in educational advancement.. 

Being in a classroom setting also offers access to hands-on learning which can be immensely beneficial for certain subjects such as physics, chemistry and engineering. In a traditional classroom setting, students may benefit from face-to-face discussion and interactions with their peers, developing a stronger sense of community that can encourage higher engagement in class activities. Additionally, depending on the course materials, online courses can be more cost effective, with fewer materials required and lower tuition costs from universities. 

Ultimately, the best option for any individual might depend on their own individual needs, the subject material, and their preferred learning style. Furthermore, a physical classroom setting allows for a better understanding of the material, as students are able to interact directly with the instructor and receive demonstrations firsthand. Furthermore, being physically present in a classroom allows the student to feel more connected to their instructor, which can provide regular feedback on assignments and help to ensure progress. Additionally, the scheduled class time can be helpful for students in developing a regular routine for studying and completing assignments, as well as for keeping themselves on track",1
"When mistakes are made, it is important to understand the difference between successes and failures. While it may be tempting to give up after a setback, it is important to learn from the mistakes and use them to make adjustments for the future. However, it is important to recognize that success is not always guaranteed. Having the support of family can provide comfort and encouragement to keep going, even when times get tough. It is easy to give up when faced with a difficult task, but peristence allows us to see the journey through to the end. 
Perseverance plays an important role in achieving our goals. Family support is another key component of achieving our goals. It is the ability to stick to a plan and continue to move toward a desired outcome despite any obstacles and impediments that may arise. It is only through successes and failures that we can develop and grow as individuals.. But, it is important to consider that family support can be both beneficial and detrimental to success",1
"
I recently took some time to look inward and reflect on my interests and skills. Additionally, I will look for ways to apply my talents in real-world scenarios, such as submitting stories and articles to publications or giving speeches and presentations at events. I'm excited to explore my potential and further develop these two talents in the coming months.. To hone these talents, I plan to practice and develop my craft in various ways. Going forward, I will read up on writing and public speaking, join online courses or forums, and network with people in the writing and speaking industries. After considering what I'm passionate about and what I excel at, I pinpointed two possible talents: creative writing and public speaking",1
"They are likely to be more informed about the situation and can provide a unique perspective. Additionally, advice from close friends or family can be a huge help in making decisions. For these reasons, getting input from multiple sources can be a great way to make a better decision.. Listening to others can provide insight into both why a choice should be made and why it should be avoided. Hearing different perspectives can make it easier to consider all of the pros and cons. 
Having multiple opinions can be beneficial when making a choice. It can also prompt creative solutions for the issue at hand",1
"Furthermore, committing to a career at a young age increases the likelihood of finding meaningful employment quicker and with greater job satisfaction. 
Committing to a career at a young age can offer many potential benefits – not just to those considering a career path, but also to the wider society. Those who commit to a career early benefit from the opportunity to specialize in a much shorter time frame, allowing them to become experts in their field and develop skills relevant to their chosen field. On the other hand, those who wait to commit to a career until later may find more varied experiences, but these experiences may not be related to a chosen profession or field.. This experience can also open up doors to further educational opportunities such as postsecondary study. By committing to a career early, individuals demonstrate a level of maturity and a dedication to the profession which can have a positive influence on their job prospects",1
"Working alone can help to prevent this distraction. One benefit of working in a group is that it allows multiple perspectives and ideas to be discussed, compared, and explored. 

However, working in a group can also be a challenge. For example, if one person is stuck on a certain task, their peers can help them brainstorm and come up with a solution. Team dynamics and disharmony can impede the progress of the task or project. Having peers to motivate and support each other can also be beneficial to the progress of a project or task. It can also be hard to remain focused when others are discussing topics unrelated to the task at hand. However, if support or advice is necessary, it can be difficult to obtain when working alone.. Additionally, everyone is often expected to contribute in a group setting, while working alone can allow an individual to work at their own pace or within a comfortable space. 
Working in a group has many advantages compared to working alone. With a variety of different ideas being discussed, more comprehensive solutions can be developed",1
"Ultimately, it is essential to thoroughly assess the potential benefits and disadvantages of shortening the high school program before making this decision. For now, it is most beneficial to remain with the traditional four-year high school program.. 

In addition to the program changes, credit and SOL text changes would need to be implemented in order to successfully transition to a three-year program. This could include the elimination or consolidation of certain classes, requiring faculty and administrators to work together to balance the needs of each student. Despite the potential benefits, there are several potential issues that could arise if all high schools were to undertake this program. Such as a reduced exposure to a variety of course offerings, placing students in a position where they are left with limited options for college preparation. Proponents of shortening the high school program argue that it would offer both students and parents much needed time and financial savings. 
In recent years, the debate about whether high school should be completed in three years has been hotly contested. While the idea of completing high school in three years may seem appealing in theory, further research is needed to truly understand the implications of such a change",1
"Furthermore, this practice may lead to greater levels of stress and anxiety for students as they are expected to perform in an unfamiliar area without having chosen it for themselves. Without the opportunity to make a decision of their own free will, teenagers will have limited control over their own future. Ultimately, when schools control students' careers, it can prevent them from fully expressing their own individuality and achieving their full potential.. This can lead to decreased engagement in their academic pursuits, feelings of powerlessness and insecurity, and impair their ability to explore interests that may lie outside of the predetermined options. 
Excerpt: 

When schools choose students' careers for them before they reach the age of making the choice themselves, the impact on the students can be far-reaching and profound",1
"
The family and society we are born into can have a profound effect on our ability to make life decisions. Ultimately, our ability to make our own life decisions is significantly impacted by both our family and our society.. This can be particularly true for those with traditionally marginalized identities, who may have limited opportunities and may face significant barriers to making their own choices. Meanwhile, society's expectations, norms, and stigmas can also shape our decisions. Family values, beliefs, and attitudes are often passed down through generations and can strongly influence our choices",1
"I should also research the benefits of committing to a career while still in high school, and look into taking online courses to gain more experience. This will help me gain the essential experience and knowledge I need to build a strong foundation for my future.. Aside from studying, I should research how to get scholarships to help pay for college tuition and explore other jobs that can help me gain experience at a young age, such as working part-time jobs. 
As a high school student interested in having a successful career and owning my own business by the time I graduate, I need to research what courses I need to take in order to achieve this",1
"In addition, allowing students to use cell phones can be a challenge to teacher authority, as it can be difficult for teachers to ensure that students are not using their phones during class time. While there are clear advantages to allowing cell phones, such as convenience and possible access to educational resources, there are also risks such as distractions and challenging teachers’ authority. This can interfere with learning, as it can take students’ attention away from their academics. In addition, cell phones can provide access to educational tools, such as instructional videos and online resources that can supplement a student's studies. 

Ultimately, a decision must be made about allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time. 
In recent years, an increasing number of students have brought cell phones to school. This can provide peace of mind to both parents and students, as parents can be assured that their children are safe and that they are able to contact them quickly in the event of an emergency. Therefore, these pros and cons must be weighed carefully as administrators determine the best policy for their school.. This has created a debate around the issue of allowing students to use these devices during passing periods and lunch time. 

However, allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time can lead to distractions such as playing games, texting, or social media surfing. On the one hand, cell phones can provide convenience, lowering the cost of communication between families and providing a connection to emergency services should the need arise. On the other hand, allowing students to use their phones during passing period and lunch time can be a source of distraction, as well as a challenge to teacher authority.

From a convenience perspective, cell phones allow students to stay in touch with their families more easily and cheaply than ever before",1
"
Making good decisions is essential for personal growth. It is also crucial to consider how our decisions might affect the people around us. When faced with choices, it is important to actively research the consequences of making the wrong decision before rushing into any conclusions. Additionally, it is of the utmost importance to take time to appreciate life because we never know what the future might hold. By understanding our decisions and their potential consequences, we can make more meaningful and wise choices that impact both ourselves and our loved ones in a positive way.. Seeking guidance from an expert can be beneficial in order to gain insight and perspective on the various potential outcomes of our decisions",1
"We had a government who let the country run free, this had a great impact to the country. There would be no regulation in the country. Even small chores prepare us for something big. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to. There is always something to do in this world; we accomplish more when we aim higher. the country was poor, people died because of huger, disease etc but now the country has accomplished so much then the people in our past would have imagined. The country is well know all over the world now. The country has accomplished by establishing government regulation which removed all the laziness from the country. If we could just go out and just help one person and day, that person would help another and another to another, this would be such a great accomplishment.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson said and believe that there is more happiness in doing something everyday then being a idle. I agree that it is okay to not do anytime sometimes because everyone needs a break in their lives. I hope everyone see's how much bad impact idle is in our lives.. The history would repeat itself and many of the tragic historical events that happened in the past would happen again. Technologies serve their own purpose but we have our own purpose, we are born to do something big. Imagine the president and the government of our country being nothing but idle and letting the country run on its own. There are people who believe in not having to go outside their house because they have all the technologies or they think they have nothing to do. If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish.

I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work. We talk about the American Dream a lot but being lazy and just waiting for something to happen will not take us anywhere.

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more.

We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive.

Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. laziness is a big wooden door which can only open by ourselves and once we open that door, theres always something big waiting to happen and once we accomplish that another big adventure awaits.

In the history of United States, there were many people who idolized idle",0
"As the British Prime

Minister Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm"". As example of this is my friend, Generic_Name, who had to take his math test multiply times. Also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal.

Those who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail sometimes.

In conclusion, based in those reasons I support Churchill's statement, and I'm agree with the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I was really excited thinking in the way that my daily was going to change. They think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldn't have done before, is a way to waste time because, you're not going to complete it anyways. Adopting the failure is the way to become master and complete our goals. As example of this is my self. Now I have a car and my driver's license even though I was hard to make it. Then, my parents decided that it was time to let me drive. A way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. They also believe that it's really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you don't achieve success.

One reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. What happened to me is a perfect example of being consistent and don't give to get success. Actually we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something that we want because, it's a way to learn more and a way to build our confidence, and we also become successful by being consistent.         . The last year I had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. In that point I wasn's really sure if I wanted to continue with that. Second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Everyone have experimented failure in some point of their lives. But it wasn't that easy because, firstly, I had to pass the driver test, next learn how drive and finally get a car. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times.

Other reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. Then I decided con continue it and I went to take the test, I couldn't pass it at the first time. First, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didn't pass it as well. As result he passed the test with a good score. If I hadn't been consistent even that I had failed it, I wouldn't have gotten my driver license. But should we really continue pursuing success after fail many times, even knowing that, it might be really difficult?. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. But this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. Actually, we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed in something that we wanted more than one time because, being consistent is a way the learn and become successful. Then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. What happened to Generic_Name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. I felt sad about it, but after studying all the rules again I came back to take on this time I was able to pass it as well. But, I still needed to get a car, fortunately my parents brought me one. This time he studied much better than the first time but he didn't pass it again, he felt stressful ""what's going on to me"" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. If Generic_Name hadn't been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldn't have passed the text",0
"Taking a career course at a young age can be beneficial in that it helps to give students an idea of what they may be interested in, and a better understanding of the different career paths available and their pros and cons. 
When it comes to choosing a career path, it is important to consider the implications for the future. One may feel pressured to pigeonhole themselves into a certain career and may miss out on other opportunities down the line. Ultimately, the decision is a very personal one; one should consider all the factors and weigh all potential benefits and drawbacks before making a decision.. However, it is also important to take into account the drawbacks of committing to a specific career path at a young age",1
"

While there is no right or wrong answer, the reality is that students should make the decision that feels right for them. There are numerous resources and professionals available to help students make an informed decision about their future and should be utilized to the fullest. It is important to consider both perspectives and to also take the time to understand and explore the range of possibilities available to them. Family members can often be a great source of support but they may also unintentionally pressure students to pursue a certain career option. 
It can be difficult for students to determine their ideal career path and it is natural to feel uncertain about the future. On one hand, some might argue that it is beneficial for students to have a clear understanding of their dream job from an early age and dedicate their time and energy to achieving it. Ultimately, the responsibility of choosing a career falls on the individual and they should trust their instincts and make the decision that feels right for them.. On the other hand, there are also advantages to exploring the different options and allowing oneself to grow",1
"Before I know it I'm going to be out of high school and out in the real world. In order for me to feel like I'm successful I need to finish college. She stopped all of her dreams just so she could always be there for me. Attending college has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid because I'd always watch documentaries; in these documentaries people would talk about what they had to do in order to feel that their lives were successful, some people had the same reason which was that they had made the choice of attending and finishing college. One thing she never got to do was finish college. Overall, this is why I want to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

In conclusion, not everyone may want to accomplish the same thing, everybody is different, but at then end of the day there's one thing that I want to accomplish the most. College gives you the information to be successful in the job of your choosing. Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.. There are jobs out in the world that do not require you to have a college education; maybe your dream job may not require you to attend school after you finish high school, but not all jobs are like this. Personally, one of the really big reasons why I want to finish college is because of my mom. These are all examples why accomplishing college would make me feel successful.

The second reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will help me learn what

I need to know in order to get my dream job. A lot of people in my family have not attended college due to not having the funds to afford it, having to stay home to take care of a family member, and most just didn't see the point of even attending in the first place. If you could accomplish one thing in the future, what would you choose? Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

The first reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will make me feel successful. Being a pediatric oncologist has been my dream job for awhile now because I think that cancer is such a sad thing; people die everyday from cancer. Being able to have the chance to even attend college is amazing, not everyone in the world is given this opportunity. While my mom was attending college she ended up having me; she was a single parent at the time and she did whatever she needed to provide for me. Knowing I have my mom supporting me no matter what keeps me going everyday, I don't give up on things to show her that I can do anything I put my mind to. In order for me to actually have the opportunity to apply and receive this job, I can't just have a high school diploma. When I get older I want to be able to help treat and get rid of children cancer so that they an live their lives to the fullest; to me helping these kids get rid of their cancer could help prevent it form ever coming back; it doesn't mean that there is a zero percent chance that their cancer won't come back, but I want to help these kids lives last as long as possible. College helps you learn specifically about the job you want to do when you become an adult; the job I wanna learn all about is a pediatric oncologist. I know that college is a long time away for me but it's coming sooner than I think. To me being successful mean you never give up even when things get hard. Most jobs out in the world require you to have a higher education than high school. I know that no matter what my parents would do whatever was needed to be able to give me the opportunity to attend college. My mom has such a big influence n my life and I want to be able to finish college for her; I want her to see that all of her hard work payed off and make her proud. These are all examples why college will help me learn what I need to know in order to get the job of my dreams.

The third and final reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because I wanna be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college",0

"Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. They are both beneficial for that specific student. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Students who do get on are on task and on point. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them.     . Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference",0
"
Distance learning and attending classes at school both have their benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, the choice of system may depend on an individual's personal needs and learning style.. In the classroom, teachers are available to help guide students with any issues they encounter, and the structure of the classroom serves to facilitate focus on mastering material. It can also allow students to engage with course material on their own terms, taking more or less time as needed for understanding. That said, the physical limitations of attending classes can also paint a challenge for students who have to work around a set school schedule, and who may not always be able to attend or complete their coursework in-person.

In conclusion, there are advantages and drawbacks to each system of learning—distance learning can offer more freedom in terms of when and how to engage with course material, while attending classes can offer more structure and personal connection with a teacher. However, online courses are often more self-directed, and as such may require that students have strong self-discipline or adequate support to ensure that the material is correctly completed.

Attending classes at school still offers its advantages, such as personal engagement with teachers and peers, as well as having fixed end-points to curriculum: namely semesters or quarters.  Distance learning, such as online coursework, can allow for more flexibility in terms of when and where instruction is completed",1

The wisdom and experience of others can be a valuable source of knowledge and growth if we allow ourselves to explore and open our minds to the perspectives of others.. 

Much of the wisdom and experience accumulated throughout life cannot be taught in a classroom. Furthermore, we can receive subtle advice on life that might not be so obvious if we focus solely on our own experiences. Those who wish to learn and grow from the wisdom of others must take an active interest in the life stories and experiences of those around them. We can gain a deeper understanding of life, learn from the mistakes of other people, and gain purposeful guidance on how to navigate life's future challenges. Engaging in conversations with parents, other family members, and friends can be a great way to gain knowledge and personal insight. After all, conversations provide an opportunity for us to ask questions, ponder ideas, and reflect on our own life experiences. 

Listening to the wisdom and experience of others can often give us a sense of perspective and help us develop better problem-solving skills",1

"Additionally, it would encourage healthier snacking while also allowing for the occasional treat.

However, it is important to consider the drawbacks of a points system as well. By incentivizing healthy choices, there is a risk that students will be more likely to go for the healthier options simply because they get more points. 
It is also important to note that the effectiveness of the points system can vary among different students and depending on the school. Furthermore, with rising food prices, it may be difficult for students from lower-income households to afford the more expensive, healthier snacks. It could also potentially reduce the amount of food waste in school since students would only be purchasing items they actually want to eat. This system would allow students to use points to purchase their favorite snacks, while also incentivizing them to select healthier options with more points. By putting foods into assigned categories and setting different point values for each, schools could help guide students to make healthier choices while also allowing students freedom to choose.

The biggest advantage of a points system is that it would create student-specific meal plans, taking into account each student's dietary needs and preferences. 

Overall, a points system could be a viable way to provide healthy food options in schools while still allowing students to enjoy their favorite snacks. It is important to take into consideration all the pros and cons of this option, as well as the impact it could have on students' physical, overall, and academic health.. 
One possible way schools can balance school meals is by implementing a points system",1
"I think that when I work in groups I feel more confident of what I am doing. For example, getting a good grade,

having a chance to meet new people, to know more about my classmates and even make new friends. But I think they are wrong. For example, If I make a mistake my teammates will let me know. If I make a mistake does not mean that I didn't try, I always try my best every day, to be a better person. Although, not all time they will feel related to my ideas, but that's one way I make new friends by demonstrating my interest. But when somebody is working alone they do not receive any support. I believe that working in group is more beneficial than working alone.

I think that having the opportunity to meet new people is really important. Because working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. When I work in groups I receive the support from my teammates. If I get a school project and I have to choose whether to work alone or work in group, I will choose to work in a group without thinking twice. I also like to hear peoples' ideas and stories. So I can not complain that I do not have support because I do have it.

Some people say, that working in groups is not beneficial as working alone, people usually complain that they easily get distracted. When I meet new people; I feel inspired, confident and happy. Dear Generic_Name, in our school is common to see many students working in groups. For example, I like to hear peoples' stories about their life and childhood.

I personally like to get good grades on school projects. So I think that working in groups is an easy and beneficial way to do my job and get a good grade.

When I work in group there's a lot a benefits I can get: I can meet new people, hear new stories from new people etc. I would like to tell you that by working in group I can get a lot of benefits. I will learn from my mistakes. Because most of the time I like to share my ideas with other people. Because I have experience how good it feels to work in groups.

Sincerely: Generic_Name . I also do my work on time, and I even put an extra effort on my task to get a decent grade",0
"Practicing self-control and having an open mindset are important steps for an individual to take when attempting to develop a positive attitude. Visualizing success and implementing self-care techniques can also benefit one's mental outlook on life. This is evidenced by many successful people who have had a positive outlook on life and achieved their dreams. It requires a high degree of self-reflection and self-awareness to stay aware of one's own thoughts and feelings. 

To continue to keep and build a positive attitude, it is best to employ strategies such as goal-setting and creating daily routines. Finally, seeking support and guidance from positive role models can lead to a more optimistic outlook on life and help develop a positive attitude.

Overall, the evidence seems to suggest that having a positive attitude – even in the toughest of times – can be extremely beneficial to an individual's personal and professional life. They have seen hardships as learning opportunities instead of roadblocks in their way to success. This ability to be mindful is essential when striving to maintain a positive attitude. Positive attitude can truly be the key to success in life, but only if it is backed by action and determination.. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. Evidence suggests that there are many benefits to having a positive attitude, not only in terms of personal growth and development, but also in increasing opportunities for success in the professional world.

"Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. This is a good option for the students who doesn't have money to pay for college/university or who doesn't want to be dependent to his family. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Graduate early from high school is a good idea but also can be hard for all students. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Some families don't have money to pay their childrens' school. I believe also to study and get prepared better for SAT

to get a higher score can be an extra reason. Specially high schools are good places for students to learn and get fun with their friends. So, student who wants to graduate early from high school needs to work hard.. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion.

First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly.

Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students who graduated from high school don't go to college/university directly. Many students like to spend time with their friends in the school. Also, student can understand how college classes are.

Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed.

In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early",0
"Elective classes give students the chance to try something new and to gain valuable knowledge and skills that are helpful for college admissions. 
Elective classes offer high school students the opportunity to explore fields of study that may increase their chances for entry into college. In addition, these classes often count for college credit, which is convenient for students who want to integrate their interests into their college studies. Elective classes can also be tailored to the individual interests and passions of the student, allowing them to explore their career interests while still in high school.. These classes are not only offered in place of music, drama, or art classes, but they also provide beneficial experiences for students who want to pursue a career in a specific subject",1

One advantage of student-designed projects for summer assignments is that students can use their creativity to develop an individualized project which will likely be more engaging. Additionally, student-designed projects allow students to take ownership of their learning, which can be empowering and give an increase in their self-confidence.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects can provide structure and focus and help students stay motivated. This allows them to explore their interests while receiving academic credit. However, with teacher-designed projects, individuality may be sacrificed, as the projects are often assigned to a group of students as one whole.. Furthermore, the teacher is looking out for the class as a whole in deciding the focus of the project, thus potentially providing a better framework for success",1
"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it?

I think is true that our selfs choose to make it be because one main reason is because nobody force us to do something we dont want to do we our selfs choose to do it or not do it, its all in our hands in making a decision and also in a decision we decide our personally in weather being a good person or being a bad person and also have to take in count if we are going to accept our consequences from our own decision of what we have choose to be and also how is going to show in our character as our personally around people and your family.

Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character form by influences beyond our control?

We choose our own character traits but we could be influences by other people and it our decision in weather doing what the rest of the people are doing and being influences by them we should take a position on the issue and to be influence but by our own selfs and not pretending who we are really not just because the rest of the people are doing it, it doesn't mean that we have to do it to it our choose and decision in weather doing it or not, we should be influences by our own form and beyond of our own control and letting nobody controlling us let live our own life.",0
"For students, who often have competing demands on their time, being able to attend classes from the comfort of their own home can be a huge benefit. As we move deeper into the 21st century, more and more students and parents are questioning whether online courses can provide an adequate educational experience for high school students. As a matter of fact, there are both advantages and disadvantages to taking online classes. For parents, the comfort of knowing that their children are not in a physical classroom environment can be a relief. 

On the one hand, the flexibility that online courses offer is attractive to both students and parents. 
In today's digital world, it is no surprise that online classes have become increasingly popular among high school students. Students and parents should weigh the benefits of taking an online class against the potential drawbacks in order to determine which option is best for them.. For parents, not being able to physically monitor their children's progress in the classroom can be a source of worry. Additionally, online classes often provide additional resources like student-led discussion boards and forums which can be a great way for students to connect with peers and get the kind of support they might not get in a traditional classroom environment.

On the other hand, the lack of face-to-face interaction and the potential for distraction are two drawbacks of taking online courses. For students, having no peers or teachers around for support can be a challenge. Additionally, distractions such as watching TV or playing video games while taking an online class can lead to lower grades and incomplete assignments.

Overall, it is clear that online classes can provide an appropriate educational experience for high school students, but it is important to consider the pros and cons before making a decision",1
"Graduating sooner gives students the opportunity to travel home more often and strengthen those connections in a much shorter amount of time.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four can open many doors for students in terms of career, family, and financial freedom. By finishing school early and entering the job market earlier, students have the potential to make more money each year, thus allowing them to save more and support their family sooner while leading a more comfortable financial life. This can reduce the amount of debt students need to accumulate and potentially decrease the amount of time needed to pay off any debt. Therefore, it is beneficial for high school students to take this opportunity and accelerate their education to be able to benefit from these potential advantages.. 

Finally, an earlier graduation date also has the potential to give students more time to dedicate to their family. 
Graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four could be a game changer for students. 

Another potential advantage of graduating almost a year sooner is the potential for financial freedom. For students interested in a technical or professional field, being able to jump-start their education and begin working towards their dream career a year earlier can open many doors in a much shorter amount of time. One of the greatest potential advantages of graduating one year earlier is the ability to start an exciting career path a year earlier. Students graduating early are able to have more free time to return to their home town and spend quality time with their family and loved ones and help build stronger emotional connections with their roots",1
"If you make a bad impression the first time with probably that person It is going to think that you are like that forever.

There is no way you can change what others think even when you have not talk to them,people think what they want to think and it is hard to change their thoughts. First impressions are always the most important thing when you meet someone you want them to think good of you so you do your best to make them feel comfortable around you.

"Some possible goals could be to reduce air and water pollution, plant more trees, clean up parks and public areas, and so on. First, I must identify a specific goal for the project. Once I have identified the goal for the project, I must specify how this goal can be achieved. This could involve reaching out to local businesses or organizations for donations or support, recruiting volunteers, and leveraging social media. I must also create an outreach plan for getting the help needed in order to successfully complete the project. 
Organizing a community service project to help improve the environment in my local area requires breaking the project into smaller, manageable steps. Finally, I need to set up a timeline that will ensure the project is completed on time.. For example, if my goal is to plant more trees, I must determine the type of tree and how many trees will be planted and the location for the planting.

"The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences.

Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain.

As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school.

Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the school's schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules.

Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Entire generations have been based upon education. . Being Against An Extended School Day

Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension.

A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their locker's present condition. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with.

Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. In essence, a student's day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone.

Sometimes, they will not have time for family activities, or they might not have the opportunity to get involved in sports that they like, which is a good way to spent time with other students. Even though students know it's going to be a longer way, it would benefit them in the future. For example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities.

"That made things worse for me. Other individual's say that having no distractions can help them work without stopping but, sometimes there are many difficult situations where we cant do much to work while being distracted, maybe being in quiet place may help. Back then when i was a little boy, I didnt know English so it was harder for me to understand teachers, or even students till i met two other kids that spoke the same language as me. People say working in groups is better than working alone, but thats their opinion even though it helps others more than it helps other individual's. I still know working alone is better because all my life i've been working alone since sixth grade. My mother or father couldnt help me as much. In a quiet place, We'er able to finish other assighment's from our jobs or school work. Finishing our work can easily be done without a group, like in our jobs, an office, or even at school. Thats how i learned to do things all on my own without help. Not everyone has a group to be in except for people that know each other , They have many people that wish to be in a group like them. next time try working on alone, in a quiet room. It can be hard but, the reward is so worth it.

People say working alone has no distractions, finishing faster than others, or learning things on our own. Till then i worked alone, avoiding others, sticking close to myself, even studying alone without anybody. . I was happy to actually find two people that speak the same language as me but, that didnt last long because i never got to see them again. Teachers and students love to be in a quiet place because it helps them concentrate more than being in a group.

In conclusion working alone is better than working in groups. I wasnt really the person to just jump in and meet others or ask for help when i needed them.

Every person has to go through many difficult times looking for a group but, Their just too shy or too nervous to say a word to other people, I would know because i was in the same problem",0

Ultimately, the choice between distance learning and traditional classroom learning will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, so researching the two and conducting a thorough comparison is the best way to ensure that a student chooses the best option for them.. Face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates can provide a sense of support and community that distance learning does not. 
Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for students as technology has improved and educators have embraced it. It offers several unique benefits compared to traditional classroom learning, such as greater flexibility, lower costs, and access to a larger variety of courses. Students can create their own study and work routines, and work at their own pace. 

Other students may find traditional classroom learning to be the better option. They also have increased access to resources such as online discussion forums, chat rooms, and webinars. 

For some students, distance learning can be a more attractive option because it provides greater autonomy. Traditional classrooms also typically have more course options and greater access to hands-on learning experiences such as field trips and extracurricular activities",1
"Additionally, each of these entities offers a unique workplace environment. The theater company has a relaxed and creative atmosphere, while the art museum has a more formal and professional environment. 
After researching the partnerships, local companies, and organizations associated with my school, I discovered many activities associated with each of them. For example, the local theater company offers volunteer opportunities, while the art museum provides educational outreach programs to the community. I must now consider which type of workplace would be the best fit for my interests and preferences.",1
"That is why you need to choose carefully what do you want, because maybe in the future you can regret and that is a bad thing that you can erase,becasue you feel frustrate because you spend a lot of time on something that you didn't like.

Being an expert in an area is something really important, the positive things for being a master is that:

You domain your area and nobody needs to command you.

You can do the things easily and quickly.

You are an expert in what are you doing, so you are exited.

Is more easier to get good things, something that benefits you.

You can get great jobs with a good payment.

You can be also your own boss or manager.

There is also negative things for being a master:

There are many people that they are an expert in any area

You need to compet with your rival

You need to try to be the best

If you have a business and you are making some mistakes you need to fix it quickly because it can affect to your own skills.

In conclusion

I disagree with Emerson, becasue you can still growing even if you are making a lot of mistakes, you can still achieve new things,you need to grow in person and in skills,always.

You can stay in the position that you are right now but you can always grow and be better everyday.. Be a master in any area is something really awesome, because you already have experience and you already know what are you doing. There is positive and negative things for being a master.

In my opinion

I disagree with Emerson becasue even if you are a master in an specific area you never stop growing, everyday you learn more about your mistakes and about life and how to live a good one, also you learn something new that helps you in all types of areas that you have in your life.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way.

If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life",0
"Like for example: When you are stuck with any of your assignment ,or doing a project, the teacher can help you with any of your assignment, or a project. However, some teachers do not help with students because the students won't get it, or learn anything. And that it is important to ask the teacher for help because when u ask for help, the teacher won't help you because you didn't ask for help.

When you work as a teacher, it needs to be fun because the student can not be bored and that they need to do fun activity like for example: Like going outside and play fun activity playing educational games that contain subjects like Math, Science, Reading, or History ,or like playing Soccer,Football, and Basketball and do more fun so that the students can not be bored. Because a student might have bad situation, or might have a ruff day. And that many school don't have local conpanies and organization that allows students to explore certain profession.. Consequently, a teacher can handle anything, or any problem that you have, or having a ruff day and you need to talk with someone, or a teacher. Dear Manager,

Did u know that many schools do not have local companies and organization that allow students' to explore certain profession?

I believe that they should have local companies and organization because when work as a teacher, the teacher can help students, have fun with students, and solve problems.

When you work as a teacher, the teacher can help you with anything. And so the teacher needs to talk to the student who's having a bad day. And that it is important because the teacher can help you with anything. And it is important to work as a teacher, at the same time it is hard to handle with the students. And that the students need to tell the truth because when your lying, the teacher won't help you and your getting yourself in trouble, and making your situation more harder and more difficult to yourself.

Therefore, working as a teacher is important because the teacher can help students, have fun with the students, and solving situation or a problem. And that it is important to have fun and instead of being bored and not doing anything in school.

When you work as a teacher, the teacher need to solve problems. Like for example: If a student is having a bad day or a bad situation, the student need to ask the teacher to help with this situation or a problem that u have that is going on. Teachers are important because they can solve problems that u have or question that you have so you can tell the teacher about it. When a student needs help, go ask the teacher for help because when u don't ask, then you won't get help by the teacher",0
"While using these moblie devices when not asked to students grades go down and they don't show interest in school anymore. We use technology to commuincate for exanple a cell phone is used to communicate with other people this helps us know where people are if needed or just to see how they are doing. Another example driving while using your cell phone, this can cause a distraction and that can lead to a car crash. If we only used technology when we had to the world would be a better place. These cell phones are not only a distraction they are an addiction to people. Although some say technology has a positive effect on lives ,actually it has negative effect on lives.

Despite the fact that technology gives negative effects it actually gives positive effects as well. Technology is part of the human life we can't take it way anymore. Technology helps us in many ways for example our jobs, many of our jobs involve technology and the use of it helps us get our job done succesfully and easier. For example a cell phone, you take it where ever you go and use it. We use technology everyday ,but technology can cause less contact with people and a distraction. This show us that with this technology we are loosing our social skill we don't even know how to say hi to someone anymore it is very sad what technology is doing to us it is stripping us away from the world.

Despite the fact that some say technology has a positive effects it actually has a negative effect. Some say technology is just an extension cord of our bodys. For example cell phones are used every day in schools cell phones distract students from their learning and their peers around them also. Technolgy can a distract people and can loose interaction with people. When using your cell phone you don't look up while walking you just keep your head down this is usually the case with teenagers and kids. We use technology everyday it is a part of our life. Teenagers don't interact with parents, peers and family memebers anymore becasue of these moblie devices. We use technology in school for example computers, cell phones, these devices help students on their everyday assigments it helps them use the internet when needed and it helps teacher with their teaching as well.

Technology causes a distraction. This shows us distraction can make you loose focus or not pay attention your surrondings.

Cell phones can cause less contact with other people. Some people are texting while driving or playing music and even the gps is a distraction because you are looking down at the gps instead of keeping your eyes on the road. These devices can cause people to not have interaction skills for example people don't know how to approached some one if talked to. Technology is not bad but it is the way we use it that makes it bad and addicting. ",0
"I realized I hurt my self so bad. She was so mad at me, then I took my hands off from my head, it was bleeding so much. I was kind of scared, she told me it was dangerous, and I can hurt myself with that.

After she left, I put the pillows together like I did it before, then I jumped to the wall. On that day, I was a little bit bored, I took the big pillows from armchairs then put them together. I think, first impressions are more effected than other events. The walls corner was really sharp, and I hit to the wall. After a moment my mom caught me. Then I went to my mom, I was holding my head and crying. If a person had a bad impression, it can gives you anxiety, which is a person needs to get help about negative satiation. It is really important what people felt or lecture extract. It was the first day I wanted to stay at home. She called my dad, then we went to the hospital.

In conclusion, I agree the reactions, impressions are impossible to change the consequences. Somehow, recollections can give you positive or negative effects. Because first reactions are usually hectic. It doesn't matter how bad or how good the impressions are, it is important how people get effect.

Second, I remember when I was first grade in elementary school, I did not want to go to the school. I was trying to jump from the pillows to the other sofa. The first time I jumped it was successful.  . We will not know until we feel something",0
"Imagine a place where honesty is the best policy.

I disagree with the old proverb because honesty might hurt peoples feels around you, honesty can make people not like you no more, and honey can not be used in a matter that you speaking of.

First when you tell people how you really feel about them it might hurt you in a way too, when people find out how you feel about them it can be good or bad, when people tell true about someone it may hurt them, and how people tell you how they feel about you it can be hurtful.

Second when you tell someone how much you do not care about them can make you look bad, when you have a friend that you tell stuff that you do not like about him can be hurtful, when you talk about people in front of them can not help your friendship with them, when you said hurtful things about them they will not like you any more,and how you tell people about what you do not like about them it can be harsh.

Finally when you tell people how you really feel in a different way can still be hurtful, the way you tell someone you do not like them can be more hurtful to them, when you speak of some one but in a different way can still grateful of hurtful, when you talk about someone in a nice vice but it can still be mean, and how you talk about someone is up to you no matter what you say.

There for you should not tell people how you feel about them no matter what you said or what they said about you.",0
"They use cameras in places like shopping store, food markets, restaurants and other places. if someone wants to travel to others country, they can take a airplane or a helicopter.

Technology helps people in education, teachers use technology to teach. Student can find any information about projects in the internet. People will have more avanced technology in the future. Also technology can help doctors, to determinate what is wrong with the patient. People use transportation when they have to work. Technology also helps with the traffic security, like lights in the road to see where are you going, see if the car infront of you stops, and cars have cameras to see when you are going back.

In conclusion technology had a great impact on peoples lieves, because it helps alot with transport, emergency, education and other. Technology had positives effects in people lives, it helps them in many ways like emergency, transport, and security.

Technology helps people in case of emergency, it helps them to comunicate with emergencies. Also helps people in case of emergency, by taking them to the hospital. It helps doctors when they make an peration.

Technology helps people with transportation, people can travel around the country from place to place. After school students can do their homework instead going to other places like in the pass.

Technology helps people with security, people use cameras to keep secure places. . It helps keep people alive in the way to the hospital. In schools they use technology to teach student how our first genaration was, how they dress and how hard was to live in the time",0
"Examples of successful students who have committed to a career at a young age include Bill Gates, who dropped out of college to start Microsoft, and Steve Jobs, who dropped out of college shortly after enrolling to pursue his entrepreneurial endeavors. On one hand, parents and society can encourage and influence career-focused decision making, helping to steer young students in the right direction career-wise. The Board of Teachers at a private school recognize the potential advantages of committing to a career at a young age, such as having a clearer focus on education and career goals, as well as having more time to work towards professional excellence, enabling a potentially smoother transition into the job market. This can open up opportunities for success and growth, but can also bring about struggles such as increased stress impacts on personal health and relationships. 
Committing to a career at a young age can come with a host of advantages and disadvantages. Both of these tech pioneers have gone to become world-renowned innovators and successes.",1
"In school, working with peers on projects and recognizing individual strengths and weaknesses can result in enhanced academic performance. In the workplace, colleagues who work together effectively and demonstrate consideration for each other tend to be more successful than those who go at it alone. Finally, in social relationships, collaboration and consideration can lead to long lasting connections and positive interactions. It is clear that cooperation, teamwork, and consideration for others contribute to success in nearly all contexts.. 
Collaboration, team-work, and being considerate of others have been proven to shape success in various contexts. In family life, collective decisions that take others into consideration tend to create an atmosphere of unity and understanding",1
"Moreover, negative attitude keeps people from taking risks and trying new things, whereas a positive attitude encourages curiosity and action-taking which can move a person closer to their goals. However, this can be counteracted through motivation exercises and encouraging words from supportive figures, as well as creating a positive environment for growth and achievement. A positive attitude can be cultivated from a young age in order to foster resilience and grit, both of which are essential tools towards achieving success. Additionally, a person's upbringing can shape their attitude, making it important to build a supportive and encouraging environment for those around us.. 
Attitude is a key factor in a person's success in life. Those with a positive attitude are more likely to continue pushing despite setbacks or difficult circumstances; this can be particularly helpful during times of high stress or when faced with obstacles. Those who are raised in an environment of positivity, support, and love are likely to have a better outlook on life. Having a positive attitude can help a person face challenges and achieve their goals. 

The effects of a person's upbringing on their attitude and how this affects their success in life cannot be understated. On the other hand, those with a negative attitude may find it harder to cope with challenges that arise, ultimately leading to lower chances of success. 

In conclusion, attitude is an important component of success in life. On the contrary, those who were raised in an environment of neglect or criticism may more readily adopt negative attitudes, thinking that their efforts will not lead to anything positive",1
"
Attitude is a powerful force that has the capacity to shape our lives. In the words of Nelson Mandela, “It always seems impossible until it’s done.”. By becoming aware of the attitudes of my siblings and family, I am better able to appreciate different perspectives and better collaborate and communicate with them.

Seeing how individuals respond to situations with either a positive or negative frame of mind has been an eye-opening experience. This introspective attitude has helped me grow and gain a better understanding of not only myself, but of those around me. When I was younger I had difficulty making friends, however, when I shifted from having an apathetic attitude to one of enthusiastic participation, I began to attract new friends and find joy in the moments I'd been missing out on.

I am constantly reflecting on how my attitude influences my experiences and the relationships I form. By having a good attitude and the will to attain our desired goal, we are able to better focus our energy and resources and achieve our objectives. It's evident that attitude has a direct effect on the outcome of a given circumstance. I have experienced first-hand how a positive attitude can open up doors I never could have imagined",1
"That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. 1-24-2011

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced",0
"Experiences can change an individual's perspective on which approach yields better results. A person who was successful in completing a project on their own might find more solace in individual work, while a person who was part of a successful team project may favor the benefits of working in a group environment.. 
Working in groups or working alone both have their distinct advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision of which approach to take depends heavily on the individual. On the other hand, individual work can foster autonomy, a higher degree of creativity, and focus on specific tasks. On one hand, working in groups can provide support, collaboration, and the potential for great ideas to come out of open discussion",1
"Most of the people that pushed away from you now may never come back because of you changing who you are and or were at one point. You also can't be a coward just because someone gives you advice on changing the way you are because maybe they are trying to help you be someone better and of good. The way someone is shows the kind of person you are and to try to change back to the person your not anymore could be difficult because you are changing your ways as a person.

Firstly; being yourself means you are unique in your own way. Be yourself dont be that person that tries to back to him or herself just because you dont like the now you. You had already been trying to be someone that you like or maybe even respect. You've changed for a reason so now you should em braise it and love your change. If you want to change your way of being change to be someone better the who you are now because out don't want to be the person everyone talks about. Do everything to try and be your own and unique person all at one because a lot of people would like to around you. Most of things you did to change yourself can just now affect you and can never be out back together again. Just by being yourself could always reflect on who you want to be once you grown up and leave from your families home.. Be you don't push your inner self away because no matter how rude and annoying you are your still one of the best person in your family. No one deserves to be changed just because people think your not a good person already. Most changes can occur maybe from someone loosing another person like they passed away and it hurts you so much you loose yourself as a person. Who you chose to be will be that same person you'll possibly be one you are more grown into life.

Lastly; be yourself and dont try to change yourself to be someone your not. If you want to change you should do it for yourself don,t do it for your friends because at the end of the day they won't care who you are or what you are. You decide to change to be a better person so move on and keeping that person you wanted to be at one point. Like maybe you suffer from abuse, violent actions, or even depression that can change you as a person. You don't have to change yourself to prove a point to someone. Being yourself brings out the better you in a person. If one of your friends, cousins, siblings stops talking to you dont bring out a mean person you weren't supposed to be because they could pull away from you and not want to be near you again. One thing my grandma would say to me is "" sweetie be yourself don't change yourself for anyone because no one will respect you and love you like your family will"". You should always show where you come from even if you are poor and dont live in such a beautiful house. Most people can bring you down just by talking about you are even getting other people to hate you maybe because your to quite or your not a good person. Show your inner person because you are probably hiding someone you haven't brought out yet. No one wants to b friends with someone that he or she is better than everyone else because thats not true. Changes can reflect you as to what goes on in your life. Be the person that stands out for being himself or herself and not the one that everyone says oh they copy everything

I get or ever wanted to be more popular somewhere be more known as a person.

Fourthly; Changing back someone you had already change to can be difficult because you had already pushed away the person you didnt want to be. Who you are now could help you throughout the rest of your life. Just by being yourself and pushing yourself to change can be such a big change in your life even maybe to your family that are already used to you being a certain way. Trying to go back to that person you used to be can be long ago by the time you try to change back to that person. No matter how mean, rude, disrespectful you are you can't really change the reason I say that is because that is how you are already as a person. Don't be someone you'll eventually regret being because that could reflect on you changing. One reason i could say is because most of those things show that you dont care about what people think or say bout you because everyone stands out as who they are. Be you unique in your own way and show everyone that you are good with who are already.

Thirdly; your personality shows your character as one. Maybe not always be yourself but dont do it or someone that doesnt deserve to see a change in you do it for yourself. Most of who you are and what you do can reflect you as a person of good. Most people change because they want to be a better person or they are tired of being so quiet and keep to themselves. Just by being yourself you should care about what other people think about you because you are who you are and no one can change that.

Secondly; just by changing you can loose your inner self. Sometimes its good to change in your life but don't loose the way you are to be someone worse because your attitude and personality is what stands out the most in you. When you are yourself your a better person because your not changing yourself to be someone your not",0
"There is no denying that having rules and expectations in place helps parents guide their teenagers toward becoming independent, responsible adults.. This ensures that teenagers are home at a reasonable time, enabling their parents to spend time with them and ensure their safety until morning. Additionally, by providing an inherent sense of structure and accountability, the curfew sets limits for teens and limits the amount of time they can take part in activities that can be harmful or illegal. It also allows teens to become independent, think for themselves, and face consequences related to their actions – all key elements for maturing into responsible adults. 

Ultimately, establishing a midnight curfew for teenagers is an effective measure for cultivating responsibility, maturity, and safety. 

The curfew encourages adolescents to plan ahead and be mindful of how they spend their time, as they must be home by a certain hour. Having a curfew in place is an effective and important tool for parents to use to guide their teenagers and help ensure they stay safe and make responsible decisions. 
Establishing a midnight curfew for teenagers can provide invaluable benefits in terms of responsibility, maturity, and safety",1

societies decide student at the young age are expected to decide what collage or univercity they want and what carrer they should be going to chose. schools shuold focus on what the student want to be in the future but they can focus to in what are they good for example: they can see if the student if good painting it can be a painter or if the are good in number it can be good in bussines such as banks , cashier and they can improve all this nuolage in the job that the students has as a part-time ,thats what the schools should focus in what the students are good and then make a decition of what can study and what it can be a good collage or univercity for each one .

societies should not expect that students with young age should decide to chose what to study (a carrer) they don't have clare ideas to decide what they want to syudy. However, when the students are youngest they cannot decide what they want to study, firts they want be a doctor and the a few years later a police and thats how it goes youngest student can't decide what they want to be until they get to a good age and a good inspiration on a class and that helps them to decide what carrer they want,student should focus on the carrer they want baced in what class are they very good when you are in eleven garde you see that your are good in something, you don't have to chose a carrer that you don't understand or you don't like. Another responsability that the student shoud focus is in get credits for dipoma that they want that can be standard or advanced diploma another think they must focus is get good grade for all four years nine, ten, eleven, and the most important 12 but when the student get into the eleven grade they must being thinking about what they want to study, searching for collage and carrers, get imformation about collage and universities that can be good for you. students in freshman year cannot decide what they want to study or what collage they want to go ,because their too young to make that important decition even if they make it , when the years passed they are going to study another carrer, anoher one that gives then inspiration

.student should not commit in a carrer with young age,they can make a bad decition, if they have another oportunity to change their decition it can be good but if they can't it can be bad if you get in a carrer that your are not going to improve.

students who enter to HS for the first time they should focus on get classes for example: art, economy, guitar, etc. However, many student that make a decition in young age they can decide but in a few month they are going to chose another carrer because they don't like what they decide or they don't have the noulage, that why youngets students cannot make a important decition until they get in a good noulage.. when they get a good noulesh ,they can ask than self, its that what they want to study and don't led anyone make a decition for you,think about a carrer that can like you and benefit you in the future something that like you and never is going to get tired of your carrer because you like what you chose for your and you have a pasion on your carrer that why society have to change that expectation that the students have to make a desiton in young age,choosing a carrer is not a game its imortant to contrivuted with the society in life if you choos a carrer that you are not going to improve is going to be dificult cause yo have make a wrong decition

Teachers in higt school shuld provide a good ideas for student talks about, how the collage or the univercity it can be teach them how is the way the collage and univercities work with the students",0

Ultimately, an informed decision is best. Additionally, the extra classes and hours of study could potentially place a strain on a student’s mental health and academic performance.

When weighing the merits of graduating early versus staying in high school for the traditional four years, there are many factors to consider. Before making the choice to graduate early, it is important to gather as much information as possible about the requirements, pros, cons, and the academic and mental health consequences that may come with it.. For some people, the opportunities available with an early graduation may outweigh the potential drawbacks, while for others it may be preferable to stay in school and complete all four years plus any additional classes. 

One of the key requirements for graduating early is taking additional courses and classes. Doing so can have academic consequences such as missing out on elective courses or having less time to fully explore a particular subject or delve into extra research. 
Many students choose to graduate early from high school for a variety of reasons, such as wanting to take college courses or begin a career sooner. Before deciding if graduating early is the right choice, it is important for students and parents to consider both the pros and cons",1
"I feel as long as your attitude is improving your work ethic and it benefits your progress then is should not matter wether or not its positive or negative as long as you have the right mind set you should have a successful work ethic. I do believe that a positive attitude is more appreciated but a negative attitude is less appealing. And by doing so you can encourage others or rather inspire others have have a good work ethic by tring your hardeste even if some one is pushing you to work in a negative way. A positive attitude is a great thin but ones attitude can be negative ,but it is more over whelming to others and some might not either like or no longer associate with that person. A positive attitude is more or rather feels more rewarding that much of a negative attitude. What that means is if the attitude is negative but it gets things done then it should not matter as long as it benefits the amount of work or what ever is being or getting done. Your attitude reflect on your work it just depends on how you use your attitude in your work. In a way attitude can guide and help ones path to success or it could close all the doors to ones dreams and success. But if my boss were to have a positive attitude then I could also use that as a motivation as it not only shows me that my boss likes that I do my work but it shows me that im appreciated.

I can see that having a positive attitude is more motivational, but ones attitude can be negative as long as it benefits you and others in a positive way. Ones attitude can be either positive or negative as long as it improves ones ability to succeed. people need to understand that they can use these attitude to benefit themselves. There are many keys to success but attitude is a major key , because attitude introduces or rather shows character. By having a negative attitude your showing to others that your work matters. A positive attitude is more rewarding and dose allow the people getting that attitude to feel more successful and more appreciated.

Although a positive attitude is more beneficial it can lead into less work or less progess being made and shows that one is not trying hard enough to succeed. Attitude is much more than just success, its the key to motivation.. for example if my boss came in yelling at me saying "" get to work your not getting paid for nothing."" thats a negative attitude so thats going to make me have a negative mind but if i can use that frustration and negativity to inspire e to do my work I will notice that all I have to do is do my work and my bosses attitude will change one me. On the side of a beneficial attitude; people can really catch the feeling of your attitude. As long as that attitude helps with your success it should not matter what type of attitude youve got.

Ones attitude is ones guide as it allows more options to come ones way. Peoples attitudes are what helps people succeed as it should motivate and help make their attitude more positive through the day knowing you did good enough to improve your self. A positive attitude is more helpful to others and motivational,But ones attitude dose not necessarily have to be positive in order to succeed. Success come to ones mind and it over comes everything if they put their minds to it.

Yes attitude is a key to success, but it dose not have to be positive if its beneficial to one in their path of success",0
"I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because it's pointless, unfair, and not important.

To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. It's no where near educational related. Majority jobs don't require for you to have any of those classes. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class.                      . It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. It wouldn't be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class.

The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It's not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. It's also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. Not every student is excellent in the same things. Therefore, it should be an elective. it's not important for students to take any of those classes. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless.

In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take",0
"I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early.                                   . also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didn't so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that don't wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you don't have to worry about for college. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you can't stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because he's so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two.

The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you don't then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines.

The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and don't need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. Then college is for you and you don't have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you can't stop because people that put the work they don't stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others don't because the were born with golden life.

Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something don't have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff.

The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you don't have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble",0
"Every person learn about their mistake. The reasons that I think that you should do your own decisions are 2. So, I believe that the people should make their own decisions. The first reason it is because you can learn new things and doesn't matter if you make mistake you can learn of yours mistakes. A expert can't choose what is better for and what it is not. The people does know what is better for you every people thinks different to what you think.

The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is because a expert does know every thing about your life. But I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts. The second reason that I think that the people should make their own decisions it is that a expert does know every thing about your life does know your feelings.

As you can see my first reason that I think that it is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is because people can learn new things in their life you can make a different in your life. Doesn't matter if you make mistakes you not are a perfect person. Also experts can be incorrectly to what is tell you to do.

In conclusion, I think is more better to do your own things and do what you think is more better for you don't let people do the things for you. You can make your own decision. Do what ever you want. The second reason it is that a expert does know every thing about your life.. The first reason that I think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is that you can learn new things in your life doesn't matter if you make a mistake. Some people believe that they should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life' important matters because some of they wants to do all the things perfect they don't wants to make a mistake",0
"A positive attitude will not alleviate these challenges; instead, one must face them head-on in order to move past them. However, this idea simply isn't true. 

It's not wrong to view life through a positive lens; but we cannot solely rely on this kind of comedic realism when reality is sometimes anything but funny. Life throws curveballs at us all the time—whether it be a nasty breakup, the death of a loved one, or coming face-to-face with a person who does not share our morality. 

We can choose to think positively in these life-altering situations, sure, but no amount of optimism will erase the fact that these events are difficult and will take immense strength and resilience to push through. Instead, we must confront these moments and hardships and strive to grow from them.. 
Many people believe that having a positive attitude is the key to life and will allow them to make it through any tough situation without any difficulty. Life has its ups and downs, and having a positive attitude won't make these times disappear. It's unrealistic to think we can simply float through life without going through any hardship by having a positive attitude alone",1

    Teaching children proper table manners is an important life skill that can help them feel at ease during meals, build self-confidence in various social settings, and make a good impression. Moreover, adults who grew up without etiquette lessons may struggle to feel self-confident in certain social settings. Those that haven't been taught proper table manners as children can feel awkward or uncomfortable during mealtimes with people of their same age, as well as in other social situations. 

Therefore, it is important to research and identify ways to encourage kids to behave during meals and instill good manners in them from an early age. This can include setting expectations for mealtime respect, setting rules around rude words or language, modeling behaviors, implementing rewards and consequences, and providing positive reinforcement. By doing this, children can develop a sense of respect for mealtime behavior, and mature into well mannered adults.",1
"That why I think that we should not allow cell phones. Dear, principal

I think we should not allow the student to bring there cell phone to school because they only use it to play or text that why peoples grade are low and 10% of people are failing. Kids in my class surely text a lot to the other kid in school. I know a lot of kids in my class that are failing",0
"            . However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals.

Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life.

There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions.

Concluding with paragraph one,two and three,'' working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,''. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;that's why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy.

Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,''that is gonna be your legacy,''",0

"Why this phrase has sustained for centuries is because its truth is timeless. Similarly, a kind word of encouragement given to someone during a tough time can do wonders. Therefore, it is important to respect and practice the Ancient Greek storyteller's advice to ""not waste any act of kindness"".. 

For example, a simple gesture such as holding the door for someone or giving up your seat on the train may seem insignificant, but it could make a significant impact on the other person. One piece of advice that Aesop often repeated was to ""not waste any act of kindness"". It may be the only act of kindness that they receive that day, and they may think about it long after it has passed. When we perform acts of kindness, we spread happiness not only to others, but to ourselves. It can show them that they are not alone and that somebody is there to support them. Every small act of kindness can, quite literally, help change the world. 

Overall, Aesop's words of wisdom carry a deep meaning and remind us of how even the smallest of kindnesses can have a meaningful impact. 
The Ancient Greek storyteller Aesop was famous for conveying profound lessons in his fables. As a result, we should never turn down the opportunity to do something good for someone else, no matter how small it may be",1
"Students mostly don't try hard unless they're rewarded. If kids try their best on the subject and still don't get a grade B average, this wouldn't be fair to them. So next time they would want to try hard and play those activities.

On the other hand though, not every kid is good at every subject. If you change this policy maybe students will try on they're best to get a grade B or above. They would be a lot of students who wouldn't agree with me because of this reason.

Changing school policy isn't a great idea, but to make the students get good grades and to benefit their lives, in that case then it would be good idea. Not every students will agree with me but that's the best way to get them educated even though it wouldn't be fair.

sincerely yours,

STUDENT_NAME. They will see their friends playing all these activities on their hard and best work. Dear principle:

I think that changing policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a good idea",0
"Find out who someone can be a life changing event for yourself not knowing who someone really is can have a big affect on you, because you really don't know who you are dealing with. Communication involves displaying confidence, and passion to show that you understand the individual topic by being eye contact and hearing all information that they are telling you. Sometimes a personality can be a huge factor on your first impression.

Neverless personality can change your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours, and efforts to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging book by its cover. Communication is key to your first impression.

Furthermore, communication skills consist of verbal and non-verbal by transferring information to another individual.            . Until they were the worst nightmare and you hate them with a passion. It has been said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. Personality is mostly made up of whom you are. Having the drive to keep going can rise-up your personality and your first impression to a different climax. The basic qualities, and beliefs you have on a individuals. Being honest no matter what with someone can build a strong first impression on yourself and the person right in front of you. That's when you really like this book. Showing the courage to do what's right in those situations, being loyal at your friends and love ones are good ways to boost you relations with another individual. I disagree because when you look at a person for at three seconds you think you know that individual already, Until you have a conversation with him/her for at least ten seconds your whole impression will change with a ""blink of a eye"". That's when you realize that this person is the one for you. Until you met them and started talk to each other. The reason why is that the way a person looks, personality, and there way communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view of a individual. In other words, looks can be deceiving personality because being honest no matter what is key, and communication skills are caused by you first impression. Until you opened it and read it. The reason why is that the way a person looks, their personality,

and their communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view on a person. Ex. The guy/girl could be the ugliest person of the time, but you never gave them the time of day. However, I disagree the first impression is almost impossible to change. Ex. I disagree that first impression is almost impossible to change. Meaning looks can be deceiving. The guy/girl could be the cutest person you ever seen and you really want to meet them. Base on you information on someone aren't ever really true. It's like saying don't judge a book at its cover. This also works vice verse. By you giving your honest opinion on a situation can grater your chances being with that individual, when keeping an open mid and resisting to give your quick judgments are clear signs of good communication skills.

Additionally. Personality provides great insight into individuals and their lives. From your first impression when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isn't always who they really are",0
"They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. . The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. They also wont have much time to spend with family. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. Students will start getting bad grades.

So, after this many reasons we all know that getting involved in the extracurricular activities can really hurt students. This can keep students away from their academic goals. All this shows that students should choose to be in the activities if they want to not that they are forced to. Joining these activities is neither healthy nor good for grades. Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals.

If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation.

Having this much pressure can affect students's grades. The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family.

Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students",0

Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year",0
"For example, mobile health technology can enable doctors to provide remote care and advice to people, even from a distance. Through social media, people can communicate and share experiences without the need to physically meet someone. This technology can create a stronger sense of physical and social freedom for people with disabilities that would otherwise be unable to receive an education or work in many industries.

Finally, communication technology can help create connections with family, friends, and strangers around the world, regardless of physical distance. 
Technology has the potential to make a tremendous positive impact on people's lives in a variety of ways. Mobile health devices, such as wearable technology, can allow doctors to monitor patient activity and receive real-time data on patient health, which can provide valuable insight into the patient's overall health status. For instance, through connected medical devices, people can receive tailored medical care, including remote health monitoring and early diagnosis of health concerns. By exploring all of the ways technology can make a positive difference, people can better understand the current and potential future benefits of advances in technology.. Additionally, telehealth programs can provide people with routine care and diagnoses to manage chronic conditions. Advanced assistive technologies, such as voice recognition software, can enable people with physical limitations to communicate more efficiently, while computer-aided reading programs can provide an opportunity to gain knowledge without the need to physically visit a library. By utilizing these tools, people can have access to quality health care, even if they can't visit a doctor in person.

Another way that technology can improve people's lives is through improved accessibility. Additionally, communication technology can benefit people in emergency situations and provide better medical response times. 

In conclusion, technology has the potential to significantly improve people's lives in numerous ways, including through improved remote health care, better accessibility for people with disabilities, and stronger connections with individuals from around the world",1
"Who knows may be students would never think they like music but after some months taking music they would find out they love it and decide to become a musician and that can also happens with art and even drama. Not matter how smart a student can be but if they cannot make themselves be notice their brilliant brain will be worthless.. well, what about those students that do not have friends, students that always sit back in a corner and the teacher has never get him to say something. These classes are like a little break, just a whole class to forget about having to write an essay or doing some long math equations and, instead just have fun with friends and enjoy singing, painting and even acting. In high school we take so many classes that are required and those classes are supposed to open up doors and get us closer to our goals. There is where classes like this can give a little opening to reduce some of that stress. These classes teach the students how to socialize and communicate with others.

High school is not as easy as some would think, students usually get really stressed because they have to pass their classes, their Sols and start getting prepare for college all at the same time. That after all we do not get anything from this classes and students just see these classes as a place to hang around with friends and procrastinating for 90 minutes. In life being able to express ourselves is something required, something that we have to do if we want to move keep moving up our hill path. Shouldn't school concern about them, shouldn't school be the place where they can grow and open up their winds to start flying on their sky of opportunities.

""Tu voz habre puertas"" It is something i heard from a commercial once i was watching TV with my mom, it means ""Your voice opens up doors"" but those doors will never open if we open our mouths to ask questions that will give us answers those answers will impulse us further in life. However, how can that same student later on give a speech or have the valor to push himself up in a big company if he never has learned how to properly communicate. Nothing will be easy but communication is a social skill we all have to learn.

Many will not agree on this and can will make strong arguments on how this classes are a waste of time. But, classes like arts, music or drama will give us something that we cannot get from others classes. High school the place where we can all do anything we want and just a step before going to college, or at least this is what a lot of middle schoolers think. The students no one has ever heard from, or sometimes even noticed they are there. Even if he has huge talent and the brain of a genius he will never be successful. Usually the environment in this classes is always joyful and fun, it is a place where students can learn through socializing and having fun. Classes like this not only give a little time off all the stress and pressure from high classes but also can give lessons to students that they would never even imagined they would learn.

Now, think about a extremely coy student who has never had the confidence to speak up in class not even to ask a question their math class, we know we all have asked something in math is just a class that at least a question per unit seems mandatory",0

The after-school homework club provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop academically and socially. With experienced adults on hand, the club can also offer guidance on how to approach problems and foster a collaborative atmosphere that allows students to ask for advice and receive feedback in return. 

These three reasons are bolstered by the fact that an after-school homework club offers a unique environment to focus exclusively in study and practice, access to more resources for help, the opportunity to reach out to peers and gain support, and get ahead on any academic goals. By offering a safe and structured space to work, it is an invaluable tool that could help students to achieve their full academic potential.. 

Three reasons to support the opening of an after-school homework club are as follows: 

Firstly, an after-school homework club provides a supportive setting for students to work in and provides an opportunity for students to receive help from one another. It also helps to reduce student stress and promote discipline when it comes to time management. Additionally, the club can be a great motivator as the environment encourages students to stay on top of their work. 

Secondly, it not only helps with schoolwork but offers the chance for personal growth. This allows them to develop relationships in a setting without a grade at stake, as well as having fun when working collaboratively on projects. The club encourages developing problem solving abilities, organizational skills, and increases communication skills through meeting with peers and discussing notes.

Finally, an after-school homework club offers a unique opportunity for students to socialize with their peers in a setting outside of the classroom. It allows students to take initiative in their education, as they take part in organizing the club's activities and events, work together in small groups, and communicate with each other in order to get help and advice. 

In sum, an after-school homework club provides opportunities to build academic skills, hone leadership skills, and increase social confidence",1
"At this time, the first impression you had about the teacher totally changed because he's not the nice teacher that you met in the first days of classes.

The first impression doesn't define who you are because first impression is like a front of a book and the front of the book is nothing comparable to the that is inside of the book. Another example could be that in the first days of classes your teacher is nice, doesn't give you homeworks, and he is patient with the students. However, He is changing every day. Now he's always mad, now he gives you a lot of homework, and he's yelling in class. And at the pass of the days he was changing, he started to smile, and he wasn't mad like the first time I saw him. Another example, is that some people thinks that you're like they think just because they have a bad first impression about you. Now my impression changes and now I can see that he's different and the first impression I had about him changed at all. If he is knowing you better, he will change his impression about you compare to the first time.

Clearly, the first impression always is going to change because one impression doesn't define my personality and how I am and I can change that impression. For example, I met someone that in the first time I saw him he was mad, he never smiled, and he was very shy. For example, I have some friends that told me that the first time they saw me they didn't like me because they says that I'm always mad and I was a boy that don't talk with anybody just with my friends and they told me that they never thinked that I'll be their friend, but they were knowing me and they saw that I was different from their perspective and from the first time I met them, so they changed their first impression about me and their point of view about my personality. I mean sometimes we don't have good days and we are not like always. Let's go to suppose that in those days you met a person and you're having a bad day, you're mad, and with problems, so that person will think you're like that because that person will have a bad impression about you, but if that person have the time to know you better, he will see that you're not like he thinks you are just because the first impression about you is bad. It has been said first impressions are almost impossible to change, but I'm not agree with it because people always change and the first impression doesn't define who you are.

The people always change to good or bad. It have to be like more than two impressions to know a person because it will be hard to changes those impresions.",0
"Cell phones can provide an engaging and convenient way for students to acquire knowledge in a digital world, but ultimately the teacher needs to make sure that cell phone use does not disrupt the learning process.. They can be distracting to students and take away from time that could be used for more traditional learning activities. Some research has also suggested that using cell phones in the classroom can lead to decreased classroom engagement and learning, as students are more likely to become distracted by texting and social media. Proponents of using cell phones in the classroom argue that cell phones can be used to access online educational resources, to aid in learning in real time, and to facilitate communication and collaboration among students. 
In recent years, cell phones have increasingly become part of the educational landscape. 

At the same time, there are some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. Educators are exploring ways to use cell phones as a learning tool in the classroom, as they can provide a great and convenient way to engage students in learning. 

In my opinion, using cell phones in the classroom can be beneficial as a supplement to traditional learning activities, provided that they are used properly and monitored appropriately by educators",1
"However, working alone can also lead to feelings of isolation and potential stagnation as one person may lack the resources and knowledge to tackle complex projects. On the other hand, when working as part of a group, disagreements and delays may occur, which could impede progress and lead to tensions within the group. 

Working alone gives one the independence and freedom to choose their own course of action. 
Working in a team or group can be beneficial in certain environments or activities, while individual work may be preferable in others.Working as part of a group provides the opportunity to benefit from the knowledge and expertise of each person in the group, allowing for greater creativity and productivity. 

In conclusion, it is important to assess the task at hand before making a decision on whether to work individually or as part of a group. Both have their benefits and it is ultimately up to the individual or group to decide which setup will lead to the most success.. This ensures that tasks will be completed according to one’s preference and timeframe",1
"Having advice from close ones can be helpful to because they can persuade someone to make choice that will benefit their life and ensure that they will not regret that choice they made in the future.

That's why having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, they help people think of better choice and new ones to, they can persuade people to make better choices, having more opinions can benefit their choice, having more opinions can make someone's choice more beneficial, having more opinions can give someone ideas. Having two or one opinion doesn't persuade someone to make better choices but having five or eight people could make someone want to make better choices because people can be very persuasive and some people wouldn't really listen or care what one or two people say but if its at least five or more then there is chance of that someone might listen or even care because lots of friends and family or even teacher want that someone to make better choices and he or she can't just ignore that unless they want to make bad choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because, you're getting people's opinions and their way of handling a situation people can give you advice that you wouldn't have thought about before and that will help your choice in many ways. Having different opinions can make someone think of a better choice because people give that someone ideas of the choice they're going to make. That's why having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.. Getting other people's opinion can help someone think of a better choice and make that choice more helpful to that someone.

Why getting other people's opinions can help someone make a better choice or think of a better choice is because, people can tell you the same thing but in a different wording. The more opinions people give someone, the more likely the choice will be or they will think of a better choice.

Opinions can persuade someone to make a better choice because a good friend or a good person can give his opinion that would make someone want to make a better choice having lots of good opinions can benefit someone's choice and make better choices. Having more opinions does help a lot because they could make someone's choice more beneficial and help someone's way of thinking about better choices, having less people wouldn't really want to persuade someone to make better choices and it wouldn't be that make someone think of a better choice. Some peoples opinions can support your choice or can go against your choice",0

"Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesn't mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that aren't related to what I want or succeed. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key.

First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and I'm convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! . If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I won't give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority.

Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. I try to stay as focused as possible because once I'm determined and make that my main focus, then It'll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal.

Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for.

Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then that's one way i can always succeed. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think it's a huge difference when you do because that's peoples main focus in life.

"By starting earlier, teens can gain more experience, explore available options, and earn qualifications that can accelerate their progress. 
It is not uncommon for young teenagers to dream of a career and make the decision to pursue a specific career path in their teenage years. Teens who pursue this approach are also likely to have a greater clarity regarding their career choices when they become adults. It is important for teens to consider their options carefully and think about the potential upsides and downsides before committing to a specific career path.. While there are some advantages to deciding on a career at an early age, there are some potential drawbacks that should be considered. 

The primary advantage of young teenagers choosing to pursue a career early is that it can give them a head start on their desired career. 

However, there are some important disadvantages to young teenagers making the decision to pursue a specific career. One of the primary drawbacks is that, although teenagers may have a clear idea of what they want to do, they may not take into account any personal and professional changes that may occur as they enter adulthood. Additionally, teens can often become so focused on one career that they miss out on various other opportunities, especially if the chosen career path doesn’t work out. 

In conclusion, while deciding on a career path in teenage years can give young people a significant advantage, there are potential risks in making this decision too early",1
"Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldn't have been blamed for.

So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. Working in a group can be helpful. But thats a whole different story. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince I'd rather work alone. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time.

Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group",0
"In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesn't want to participate because they're lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. I know that students should have good grades before you try out for the team. And those who doesn't want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

The best thing is for the students who want to try or join the team for basketball, tennis, badminton, baseball, hockey, and wrestling is the best thing because few students always wants to join or try for the team. I should agree because it can make your grades higher by joining sports, after school subjects or classes, and it make you more smarter and more. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up.

I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didn't followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies.

If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities.

And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. Generic_Name made a decision to stay after class and do the retakes and after 3 weeks Generic_Name has good grades and he try out for baseball and made the team.\

I agree that students should participate to after school classes or sports. Before I also don't want to go to after school classes, but when I got a really bad grades I started to go to a after school classes and finish work and do retakes and here I got some good grades.. And my two friends join for basketball and hockey my one friend named Generic_Name wants to try out for baseball this spring season and he is really good at basketball and baseball, but the only wrong for him is he has bad grades. Even me I stayed after school just to finish my work or do some retakes and get a better grade this year",0
"The combination of my skills and interests, along with the knowledge I had gained from speaking to people in this field, confirmed this. In my essay, I will explain why this career path is the right choice for me and how I can use the resources available to me to gain the necessary skills and experience to pursue it successfully.. To gain further insight into the specifics of this career, I contacted people who were already working within the field in order to learn more about what was required of them and the skills they had developed in order to be successful. 

Through all of my research, I determined that this career path was the perfect match for me. 

After spending time researching various career options, I discovered a career that not only appealed to my skills and interests, but also fit my long-term goals. During my conversations, I discovered the courses I could take in order to gain the knowledge and skills needed to make me a top candidate for this field",1
"Learning from the experience helped me to become more resilient and persistent in everything I chose to do in life. When the results weren't what I had hoped for, the disappointment was overwhelming. The experience shaped my outlook on life, teaching me that it was never about reaching the final destination; it was about the journey and everything that came with it.. I had been working tirelessly for weeks on a project, and had put so much effort and energy into it. 
I remember a time when I experienced failure. I learned that I was capable of bouncing back from failure and working towards something greater, despite the bumps on the road. I felt so let down and frustrated that I had let myself down.

It took time, but I was able to reflect on the experience and realize that failure was an inevitable part of life and instead of beating myself up, I needed to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes.

In the end, I found the courage to get over the failure and start again",1
"

Opposing this view, some may argue that taking action is not the sure-fire way to reach success. Sitting and waiting for something to happen will almost never lead to success; rather, taking action as consistently as possible is much more likely to bring us closer to reaching our goals.. Those who do not take action at some point in their lives and instead choose to sit and wait for something to happen are much less likely to reach success. Examining successful individuals is a great way to illustrate this point. Not only did she become the first African-American billionaire, she also created many platforms to help empower women around the world. This is, however, an incorrect view to take. 
The idea of always striving to do something in order to improve one's life is a widely accepted view that is here to stay. If we look back at examples in history, there is a clear correlation between taking action and reaching success. Furthermore, if we look at our own lives, any time we took action we moved closer towards our goals. Whether in school, at work, or even in sports, we can identify times when we moved closer to success because of action.

In conclusion, the idea of taking action in order to reach success is valid, and it is proved time and time again by history and our personal experiences. For example, Oprah Winfrey grew up with little opportunity and faced immense poverty growing up; however, she pursued every opportunity she had, and became one of the most successful individuals in the world",1

Staying active is a great way to reap many physical, mental, and emotional benefits. Alternatively, another benefit of staying active is the potential to gain recognition, which can be achieved with greater self-discipline and the dedication to follow through on commitments.

In essence, staying active offers numerous benefits. It enables them to stay focused on what’s important and to channel their energies in constructive directions. Although they may not seem to be connected, exercising regularly and achieving success are closely intertwined. Taking the time to engage in physical activities helps to avoid boredom, encourages a healthy life, and facilitates the attainment of goals. 

For instance, if an individual has a large project to complete, setting aside time to engage in physical activities will help them to stay focused and prevent distractions from impacting their progress. Keeping active can help to avoid boredom, as it provides an outlet for creativity and a way to make use of extra energy. By combining the two, success is achievable in a shorter period of time. Moreover, staying active can help individuals to achieve their goals in life. To sum up, staying active is an important part of daily life and offers remarkable benefits to those willing to make the effort.. Being active also encourages a healthier life; exercising increases strength and endurance, and contributes to better resistance against disease",1
"we have met peolpe who appear to be kind while they gain their trust and that is whea you realize that you are failing that you have been linked to bad people even in recent years,bad people there are people who have an evil background because of their environment can shape us to detect bad peolpe, the occurrence of very mediatic cases of munder or abuse of people make society silvery high because there are such people bad.

The virtues are the qualities we have and that provides a good for the same and for others is to say not knowing how to live whith another in my case, terrible things usually happen to me when I talked to my aunt, I did't know that she was aggressive discriminating well, not only does it happen to me, I have seen more people who go through terrible things that even their own family is bad with onw in case it is terrible to happen with bad people influence.

A

person with who, spoke and through the times, realized that he would be badly took him out of school so that the child would be unable to read and would fail to steal in stores how bad it is why he closed the doors and I take that great opportunity away from the boy now the boy is a boy, who is in perdition, because how his own mom did every thing to him now he is a bad boy who is stealing is aggressive all because of her mother's fault why she took that great opportunity from the boy.

that is why today there is so much evil bacause many and others were separated from their relatives making is not only one of the most bad people the propensity to the evil of these children is in the way it is conformed to detect so much evil today full give people with the smile in the mooth and the poison in the heart. . I 'll talk about the disagree in many causes I have been paired with people who are bad they have their bad character, they are aggressive, discrminator, inpulsive ,in that aspect, however, one is at risk while being with bad people they even try to do things to one, for example they beat him, they mistreat him, they require him, to do bad things such as killing, rooting, selling druds, and much more in those causes, they usually happen bad today there is much evil sim embark they try to undo othres by giving them bad ideas so that they run the risk just as they do.

"If a student chooses to forgo a summer break in order to keep on track for graduating early, they risk running themselves too thin and may become burnt out. Furthermore, when attempting to graduate early, students may be tempted to allocate more of their time and energy towards classes that they are good at and neglect other courses, leading to an imbalance in their educational experience. Staying on top of daily workload and taking multiple and more difficult courses per year can lead to exhaustion and decreased academic performance. 
Graduating high school in three years rather than the traditional four-year period can be incredibly beneficial in terms of saving time and money. Unfortunately, this accelerated timeline can come at the cost of overexerting the student.  All things considered, trying to graduate in three years instead of four can be advantageous in some circumstances, however, it is important for the student to consider the consequences that come with it.",1
"

Overall, I've found that taking risks in life can help us grow as individuals. Through exploring new opportunities, we can open new doors and take our lives in new directions. Although I didn't have all of the qualifications, I decided that it was worth the risk to apply, and I eventually got the job. It's important to be smart and take calculated risks, but it's also important to remember that sometimes taking a risk can be the best way to reach our goals.. 

Another example of taking a risk happened recently in my personal life. After much thought and reflection, I decided to quit my job and move across town to search for a new career path. 
Recently, I've come to realize the importance of taking risks in life. One of the best examples of this has been in my own career. I'm now much happier with my new job and lifestyle, and I couldn't have achieved it without taking the risk of leaving what I was comfortable with. Last year, I decided that I wanted to take a risk and apply for a highly competitive management role at a large corporation. I had been feeling very stifled in my current job, and I was not happy with the way that my life was going. This experience taught me that taking risks can pay off and help to open new doors. This decision was definitely a risk, but I think that it was one that paid off",1
"Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

Please help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams. Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Students failure the game every time when we have a game with another team, because for some reasons they do not beat the game. If they can continuing to study in the future they can earn to much money, because in the past it was hard for them, but now is more easily then the first time when they start                             . That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game",0
"By researching its background story, we may find that our initial reaction was mistaken and that our opinion has been swayed by our past biases and judgments. As we gain familiarity with someone, often our perception can change drastically and lead us to appreciate the nuances and complexities of their lives and experiences.

Likewise, a cursory glance at an object or artifact can lead us to form a negative opinion before we take the time to learn its history or purpose. It is human nature to make snap judgments, but it is up to us to expand our awareness and understanding if we want to break down barriers and push past previously accepted stereotypes.. In a world where first impressions can be misguided by preconceived stereotypes, it is important to dig deeper into the history and implications of our assumptions. A superficial reaction to a person's ethnicity, dress, or background can lead to a shallow understanding of their culture and characters",1
"Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. That's one of the best ways to conserve cars' energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas.

Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that don't have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well.

Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. Adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. Conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged.

Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people.

To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. Firstly: conserving energy light and food and saving gas and money, having extra time for work, friends and most important: Family.. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. It will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs.

In conclusion, Adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources. As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the school's building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they don't live around the school area",0
"Similarly, our educational and professional experiences can significantly impact who we are and how we perceive the world. The messages that these sources promote can shape our thoughts and attitudes, affecting our behavior down the line. It is ascertained by what we choose and the effects of external influences. 
Character is fundamental to understanding one’s personality. Ultimately, our individual character is the result of our own choices combined with the impact of the environment on our lives. Equally, the example that our parents, mentors, and friends set can influence our decisions and mold our character in both positive and negative ways. The guidance of those around us can help us learn to be strong, courageous, and determined. It is important that we strive to seek out positive influences and choose wisely when presented with difficult decisions.. Though life throws unexpected challenges our way, our choices in response to them allow us to develop resilience and inner strength. 

Similarly, the media and culture that we are exposed to are essential players in developing our character. The journey we choose and the resources that we leverage along the way determine who we become and how we approach life. 

In the end, character is shaped both by our individual choices and the influences of the external world. 

Our experiences, both good and bad, shape our character in ways that we may not be aware of",1
"Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. I also think this is very important. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. Planning is really important for all of our lives. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class",0
"Setting achievable goals and limiting procrastination can help to boost your confidence and take the stress out of school. 

In addition to financial help, it’s important to have confidence and structure in order to make the most of your college experience. From housing assistance and food pantries to emergency assistance and government aid, there is help available for those in need. It’s important to take advantage of these resources to help make college a viable option for everyone.. 

Finally, for those without a family or a place to stay, there are numerous resources available. From scholarships and grants to work-study and part-time jobs, there are ways to pay for tuition and other expenses. It’s also important to be aware of the responsibilities that come with attending college. An education can give us access to better job opportunities, higher incomes, and a chance to pursue career paths that were previously impossible. But with rising tuition costs, student loan debt, and other expenses, attending college can be expensive. It’s important to manage your time wisely and be efficient with your money. It’s also essential to consider the emotional toll of college and what you owe to yourself and your family in terms of support. 
Completing a college degree can provide a number of benefits. Fortunately, there are a number of options available to help financially support yourself while in college",1
"Ultimately, the potential benefits of a four-day school week must be weighed carefully against the consequences for students with part-time jobs.. Furthermore, costs associated with transportation, such as gas and tolls, and food could be reduced as schools would only be open for four days each week.

However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of a four-day school week, particularly for students with part-time jobs. 
With the implementation of a four-day school week, the conservation of energy and resources could be significantly enhanced. While the additional day off could give a student more time to pursue an after-school job, it could also result in fewer hours and less pay due to the extended school day. The extra two hours added to the school day could be used to provide additional instruction and educational activities, which might lead to a more efficient use of resources and energy",1
"you make your life successful by doing what you want, and trying hard for and not giving up and being negative to be successful you will make mistakes, but you learn of those mistakes, and not make them again , or do better at something you din't do good on the first time, so just keep trying, and stay positive, and be successful in life . It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life, Because if you have a negative attitude that means you don't believe in your self or you are insecure so you may not be successful in life; but if you have a positive attitude, and know what you doing is correct, so what you doing will make you successful in life. if you are successful in life that means you are positive, and you are happy that you are doing everything as you want.

being successful means that you have achieve most of the things you want in life like buying a house, a nice car, going to college, or getting a diploma; so you always should stay positive,and try hard for something you want in life. being positive will make you successful. being negative won't help you get what you want, or achieve a goal or a dream because you won't believe in your self and you will just let everything just go, and not really try hard for what you want",0
"Now i really want to go to portorico and explore new stuff and have a nice adventure.. I want to be greatful of everything that i am able to have and they dont and maybe share the stuff that i have and they dont. It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe i might start being greatful for what i have and they dont and i would start helping others mor often.

One reason i would go to portorico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear,what they eat, and what they do on daly it would be intersting seeing all that and i would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a portorican.

Another reason i would love to go to portorico is because at the USA i am not greatful for what i have and maybe if if i go over to portorico i will be greatful for what i have because i will see the difference of how i live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealth and i am over here throwing my food away because i dont want it.

My final reason for wanting to go to portorico is because i will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because i want to see if they are different than El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay.

In conclution I would like to see every difference they have from the USA and El Salvador and i want to try every food that they have and spend time with students. One place i would like to go visit in this world would be portorico because it looks like a wonderful place to live in and because i want to experince how it is to live there or how school is for them",0
"One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. This can help students to improve their grades,because every activity count as a grade or extra credit.

Firstly,students should do extracurricular activities because this can improve their grades, if they do extra credit after school teachers can replace a missing assignment for the extra credit. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger.. 78% of Americans students do extracurricular activities, by staying after school,doing sports and serving on the student council. They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends.

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school",0
"We were sitting at home idly doing nothing; until when Generic_Name suggested that we should go and try out the UFC GYM. I wanted to sign up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, so that I can get busy with my time, and use it wisely. I encourage every idle human and people who thinks inactivity server a purpose to get engage in activities, having more time with their books, and trying out new things when ever they feel like they are idle. try out new things when ever you are idle. We went there, and signed up for the training; they gave us a one day trail to see if we would like the training. Although some says that inactivity serve a purpose, because the can get more time to them selves then when they are in activities, actually determine never to be idle, because we can accomplish many things; If we are always doing somethings such as involving in activities, having more time with our book, and trying out new things.

It had been writing by Thomas Jefferson "" Determine never to be idle "". The teacher always asked him to read out story books and passages to his classmates in school. I finally signed up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, and I got accepted by the coach. You can do a lot if you try out new things. We can accomplish more if we are always doing somethings; therefore, determine never to be idle.. It is very true that some many people and students are always idle; they don't use their time wisely. I was not perfect, but I tired out a new thing and I got some experiences from it.

As a result of all the reasons and examples. I started training with new people, and I made a lot of friends.

Instead of been idle, why can't we spend more time with our books? The more we go close to our books the more we learn faster, and increase our skills in reading; for example, my friend Generic_Name, his parents never wanted him to hang out with friends that much, or neither been idle without having his book to read. We went there the next day and started training for one hour; after training I told my friends that I don't like the training, because it was gave me back pains, so I quit the gym, and my three stayed in the training, because they like it. We can do a lot if we involved our selves in activities instead of been idle; for example, when I came to the United States in January 8,2017. He inspired many students in his school, and most students wanted to be like him, so they started having more time with their books at home.

In addition, people who wanted to be idle, or people who think inactivity serve a purpose are people who are not determine, and not planing on their future; they don't want to involve in activities, or interact with people. You can learn a lot even if you are not perfect; for example, me and my three friends Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Generic_Name kept on spending most of his time reading his books for a long time, and he became a good reader in his English classroom. I was sitting at home for two months without going to school, and doing nothing. I got tired of been idle, so I told my mother that I wanted to something instead of been idle. Idle people are lazy, because they don't want to try out new things",0
". Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue!

I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people don't have ideas of something they need help with. They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. I think people should always give at least another person's thoughts on what they need help with. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas. It is always best to get another persons idea. Some people need a better choice, so its better to ask other people then just think of your own ideas because hearing other people's thoughts can make your ideas better. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence on what they need advice on.

Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas. For example, Generic_Name wanted to plan a birthday party but she needs help on what theme she wants for her party. Generic_Name asks her mom, dad and her friends",0
"I prepare for school the same way when i have big projects. My mom tells to just break it down and do little bit of everyday. One of the most important thing is racism. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believes that there is so much that can be done if we are always doing something because if you are doing something all the time even if it's little it can be done but may take time. I believe we can end racism by doing something about it everyday. I always believed that i can do a lot if i'm doing something all the time. My dream was to be a soccer player but i wasn't training everyday so i didn't get where i wanted too. Everyone has dream to be something in order be that you have to do something everyday to reach your dream. By doing something everyday you can accomplish your dreams and get your work done. If you want to be professional soccer you will have to work everyday. When i do that i get my projects done fast.

If you don't practice everyday then yo won't get better at soccer. I use to play soccer 2 years ago and i wasn't practicing everyday so i did't get any better. Only when we do something you accomplish more. There is a lot of things that need be done in our country. A lot white police men are shooting black men and are not getting anything for it. I think they should at least get some punishment because it's not fair to the people who died family's. One of the most famous quote by Thomas Jefferson is, "" Determine never to be idle... I believe we accomplish more if we are always doing something for example if you don't practice everyday then you won't get better at soccer. Police officer shooting black men that didn't do anything. I believe this could be fixed if we all come together and do something about it everyday.

As you have read we accomplish more when we are always doing something. When i was little i use to make Lego's i would always build them, i was always doing something to them. One of the most important thing is racism , if we do something about that everyday to end racism.

If you are always doing something then you will get a lot done. I think racism needs to end as soon as possible. That causes people that have been killed family's pain. One of the most important things in this country is racism because a lot people are getting killed by it. . My mom always told if i'm building them everyday i could get done fast. When i have big projects i tend to freak out. When your building a house you are always doing something to it but if you stop then it will more time to build. Most people don't make their dreams because they don't do the little things that matter everyday.

There is a lot that need to done in our country. When you don't do that you won't get any better because you have to train everyday so you can be great at soccer. The world would be in better place if we everyone did something to make the world more cleaner and safe",0
"On the other hand, however, there are a few potential drawbacks to consider. Furthermore, without these experiences, students may struggle to develop the very skills necessary for academic and professional success. 
Finishing high school in three years is an intriguing proposition that has gained significant traction in the last few years. While it may be a great option for certain individuals who are ready to move on to the next phase of their lives, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that students are still able to enjoy and benefit from the high school experience.. The most significant concern is that students may miss out on important experiences, such as extracurricular activities or even friendships, if they leave high school too quickly. Additionally, many students are self-directed and mature enough to handle the rigors of completing high school early. 

Overall, whether or not completing high school in three years is a good idea is a decision that will vary from person to person. On the one hand, completion ahead of schedule is an attractive concept to many students who are eager to begin college and make an impact on the world",1
"Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for",0
"You have to be strong and learn of them, to be a best person in the future. As a result of this mistake the food obtain a different flavor, but of this failure I can learn and upgrade my skills like a chef.

Another example could be: when a student fail in a test, but has the chance to take a retake, is there when the student spend all their time studying to get a better grade. A characteristic of the humans is that we try to overcome all the challenges that we have in our life.

The failures teach us how to be a best person. Don't give up, we have to be strong. I will not let the failure defeat me again, I will return more strong and with more knowledge.. If you are negative, is very probably that you will start to have bad thoughts about yourself. Nobody is perfect in this life, at contrary all the people make mistakes. The success is achieve something, is like a goal that we want reach. I'm bringing all of me to get a good grade, what I mean with this. Let me tell you something else, I don't know a lot of english and I'm taking this test that have to be in english. The people just have to be more optimistics and see the failures from a good point of view. That a mistake don't stop you of achieve your goals. If you are negative, you never will be happy again, because you will stay thinking in the failure you had. Well, even if I don't have a good grade, I learn many things that will help me in the future. Or you want stay in the same place, with the same problems forever? No, right? You have to figth to overcome all the challenges that will appear in your life, and remember never give up. Also we can take with enthusiasm this kind of failures and learn from them. I'm telling you all this, because I had this kind of problems previously.

In conclusion, don't let to the failures defeat you. If you are negative with a failure or mistake, let me tell you that maybe you will loss the battle with yourself. For example: When I try to cook something to eat, sometimes I forgot to add an ingredient. Daily the people commit diverse mistakes, but depend of us to determine if this mistakes will define us",0
"Additionally, those who are unsure of their post-high school plans may not have enough time to research their options or gain sufficient familiarity with the college application process.. Furthermore, those who decide to save money by enrolling in a less expensive college for this fourth year could use this time to take more classes or get work experience.

However, graduating high school in three years could also have a negative impact on student life. 
Graduating high school in three years instead of four could provide students with several potential benefits. With an accelerated timeline, students could move on to college a year earlier than their peers, freeing up time to partake in more campus activities or take on a summer internship. Furthermore, students may be better prepared for college given the exposure to more challenging classes and the chance to complete appropriate coursework earlier.

This option could also benefit students’ extracurricular activities. Without an additional year of high school, students may miss out on some of the traditional experiences, such as playing sports or attending school dances. On the academic front, this would likely lead to a more advanced curriculum where students can cover more material in the span of three years as opposed to four",1
"In the future I hope we have less useless people and more people who like to get things done.  . For example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. Many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You get more things done, you will not be considered lazy and you get to learn new things.

When you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. This habit will definitely get you a job. This is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. You will be caught up and on time which is really good for your credit score.

You will not be considered lazy. You will not be behind on anything. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless.

You will learn new things. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. Do you accomplish more when you always keep yourself busy? In this essay i will argue that keeping yourself busy serves a purpose. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. The more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy.

Some people say inactivity serves a purpose, but they are wrong because when you are always doing something it keeps you motivated, experienced and makes a good habit to have",0
"At the same time, we have the capacity to choose our own path and shape our own character through a combination of self-determination and free will. For instance, we may be born into a particular set of family circumstances that shape our decisions and beliefs, and these can have a strong impact on our behavior and attitude. For example, we may choose to pull away from negative influences or make a conscious effort to cultivate our own strengths and passions. Ultimately, it is a combination of our own decisions and influences that forms our character.. 
Our character is not simply predetermined by factors beyond our control; instead, it is the result of a combination of both our own choices and influences from beyond our control",1
"Yes teenagers should do curfews because they will stay out of trouble and stop braking the law. The next thing I want to add is young people have to be shown and have experiences the a 10:pm weekend curfew is a descent amount of time to get them well trained other places like military, Juvenile, and like closing of businesses. However, another example is vandalizing when you harm someone's property without permission as an example like graffiti, braking car window's, and invading somebody else's property.

In conclusion, every teenager who brakes laws should attend to curfews for a beneficial life experiences so they can get the best out of them and they can prevent teenagers out of trouble.. They will be discipline,and have respect of themselves and others example lets say you have a child is a minor and he or she breaks the laws and always gets in to trouble the military is one of things that will keep you discipline or otherwise they won't be well trained. However, they will carry the behavior through their work place and public areas with good attitude and good behavior and it will never interfere of young person's live for example,lets say a job interview and the person who wants to hire you and he or she will see your characteristics and how many times you have broke the law and getting into trouble the person won't hire you can't get a job when you have a bad record of committing crimes and facing the law so, curfews are a good suggesting with young people that you can't say no to. Teenagers have a hard time staying in one place of a very long time with no free time a midnight curfew for teenagers is good for them so they can reflect and learn for their mistakes.

Some teenagers are committing crimes and getting away with it but this program well benefit them but in a matter time they will become good teenagers and obey the law",0
"The power of positive thinking increases motivation, resilience, and optimism, all of which are necessary attributes for success. By being aware of the power of attitude, and how it can affect one's success, individuals can work towards cultivating the attitudes that will bring them closer to their goals.. 

For example, a person with a negative attitude may be hesitant to take risks and challenge themselves, due to fear of failure. On the other hand, a person with a positive attitude is more likely to persist despite overcoming obstacles, ultimately leading to a much greater likelihood of success. While positive attitudes are beneficial for motivation, resilience, and optimism, negative attitudes can help to reduce risks and prevent major disasters. It is one of the greatest determining factors in a person's success, both in the short and long term. A negative attitude can impact the success of an individual, by leading to feelings of apathy, pessimism, and even poor health. 

In conclusion, one's attitude plays a crucial role in their success, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. Depending on one's attitude, outcomes can vary greatly. 
The power of attitude should never be underestimated. On the other hand, if one has a positive attitude, it can be immensely beneficial to success. This isn't to say that negative attitudes don't have their benefits - in fact, being cognizant of worries or possible concerns can help to prevent major disasters",1
"With more research, more organizations and countries may deploy these programs in the future.. 
In recent years, programs featuring older students helping younger students have been growing in popularity. For instance, in Denmark, there's a program called udvekslingsstudent, in which older students from Danish high schools mentor their younger counterparts in both academics and extracurricular activities. These programs are designed to teach the younger generations a variety of skills, such as walking, social etiquette, and respect for others. 

All in all, programs involving older students helping younger students, provide a great benefit for all involved, as well as for the environment. In the United States, the Big Brothers Big Sisters program operates on a national level, pairing older students with at-risk youth in an effort to provide mentorship and guidance. For example, an increase in mentorship opportunities for younger generations may lead to increased understanding and appreciation for nature.

Many countries around the world have implemented similar programs tailored to their specific objectives. It is believed that these programs not only provide educational opportunities, but also open job prospects and give participants the chance to explore talents they may never have realized before.

Moreover, programs like these could have a positive impact on the environment",1

"When we view interactions with others in a positive light, we are more likely to understand their point of view and approach them with empathy and kindness. When we approach life with a positive attitude, we start with the premise that we can achieve our goals and strive for success. Being positive leads to a happier, more fulfilled life.. We also open ourselves up to all of the potential for joy life has to offer, which can lead to a feeling of greater wellbeing.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is essential to success in life. 
Having a positive attitude is essential to success in life. A negative attitude causes us to focus on only the bad aspects of a situation, whereas a positive attitude allows us to see the potential for good even in the most challenging circumstances. It affects our relationships, how we view and solve problems, and the likelihood of achieving our goals. A positive outlook enables us to realize that failure is not always the end of the story, and that often it is possible to learn and grow even in the face of adversity.

Third, there is a big difference between positive and negative attitudes. In contrast, a negative attitude can lead to conflict and further alienation from those we care about.

Second, having a positive attitude can help us to approach problems in a constructive way. 

First, having a positive attitude can help us form better relationships with other people. This in turn can make it easier to find solutions to difficult problems rather than viewing them as insurmountable challenges.

Lastly, having a positive attitude can help us to achieve our goals and be happier overall. Rather than wallowing in self-doubt or giving up when faced with difficulty, a positive attitude encourages us to have faith in our own abilities and take action. A positive attitude allows us to approach every situation with optimism, rather than fear or pessimism, and this can make a significant difference in our lives. It impacts not only how we interact with those around us, but how we perceive and overcome obstacles",1
"This allows them to take classes and specialize in certain areas that can help them stand out on college applications or job applications later on. It can also help them build their resume and further demonstrates their commitment to their education.

Lastly, by taking summer or evening courses, high school students can use their available time to explore other educational opportunities such as internships or research opportunities without consuming the bulk of their regular school day. Doing this can give students more time for independent study and other activities that can help with their future academic and professional goals.

Another advantage of taking courses over the summer or in the evening is that it gives students time to focus on certain subjects that they are interested in. 
Taking courses over the summer or in the evening offers numerous benefits for high school students looking to graduate early. One of the most attractive benefits is that it can bridge gaps in a student's education, helping them to accelerate their coursework and graduate earlier. For students looking to graduate earlier, these courses are a great way to maximize their time and make the most of their high school experience.. Doing this can provide the student with valuable real-world experience and knowledge that can be difficult to gain in a traditional classroom setting.

In conclusion, taking courses over the summer or in the evening can provide high school students with a wealth of benefits, from bridging gaps in their education to exploring educational opportunities outside the classroom",1

On one hand, proponents of shortening summer break argue that the extra time in the classroom will lead to better academic performance, as students will have more opportunities to learn and apply their knowledge. Therefore, reducing the length of summer break should not be considered at this time.. Additionally, an extended school year often leaves less time for students to spend with friends and family, diminishing important social interaction needed for optimal mental and physical health. It has also been suggested that reducing summer vacation can lead to a decrease in the summer learning slump, as students' minds remain sharp and engaged year-round. 

Overall, while it may appear that the pros of shortening summer vacation could greatly benefit the educational system, the negatives that come with it should also be taken into account. Reducing the length of summer break, though often met with resistance, has been proposed as a solution to some of the educational system's current issues. Taking away time from optimal physical and mental activity, and reducing the ability for students to develop outside the classroom, can be detrimental in the long term. Before deciding whether to reduce time off in the summer, it is important to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a drastic change in schedule. However, while these benefits are worth considering, there are some potential inconveniences that cannot be ignored.

For one thing, a shorter summer break would drastically reduce the amount of free time students would have to explore rest and relaxation activities, and contribute to their own personal growth. 
As the school year winds down each year, a summer break of three months beckons. The development of hobbies and use of creative outlets is an important part of childhood, and reducing the number of months available for engaging in such activities can be damaging",1

I can tell people were having a lot of fun by their smiles on their face, and by running up and down the field. I will always remember the first time I walk outside to enjoy the outdoors view. Then Other people were swimming in the river water because it was a very hot day outside at the park.

Last reason, is when I went to the National Park for the first time also. There was also other people playing tag with other people at the park. I will never forget playing at the Community Park playground that day. There were a lot of people there so we had to wait for our turn to use every equipment they had at the Community Park.

Second reason, is when I went to the State Park for the first time too. Like the swing, slides, wall climbers and the monkey bars. We can take brakes if we get tired of walking in the National Park and sit down.

"theres programs in high school that take students to colleges and take them on tours or they either tell the what to major on in that specific college, With planning early for your future you save time for stressing out last minute. I feel like this shouldn't just be small societies making students plan really early this should be the whole nation because as students we are the future of the united states so why not start 4 or 5 years ahead. Today i will be discuss if it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? most may disagree with this statement, but i will hopefully grab your attention and hope you could agree with me.

I think it is a good for students to decide on there career this early because number one in today's society everything is depended on technology. But again my point here is that yes i do agree that careers should be set when they enter high school.

With entering high school students are introduced to a lot of programs at the start of there new journey to life. So in my opinion i think that there future is set way before high school.              . What are students into nowadays there phones, video game, IPads , computers, etc. Although some people may say that this is a huge distraction only because students would want to just focus on the future instead of focusing on whats happening right now.

So the main argument is that I 100% agree with students choosing there careers at a young age. in addition to my statement I also think that schools should have a bunch of programs helping students out with there future that way they won't stress there last year of high school, and they won't have to apply to colleges not knowing what to do. My main reason is that the early the better with chances of programs and guidelines to help you on your way to a better education theres no way that you can stress for a career. So pretty high advanced technology is everywhere, My point that i'm trying to make here is that the majority of students get either there phones or computers at a young age",0
"If we had a hour and a half more then teachers shouldn't give homework to students. i have a few reasons why we shouldn't do that. these are going to be my reason why in this passage.

First reason is homework if we have more time in the school day how would students have time to do their homework. and all the work they have to do would them holding longer which would keep longer away from their families too this is is why schools shouldn't have more hours in school     . Second reason the time after school and third reason why is teachers. Reasons why the school board not add one hour and a half more for each day. first reason homework. students shouldn't have more time in school then have homework after school students have have some time to enjoy themselves and still do homework if we have more hours in school students wouldn't have the time to enjoy themselves. If students did their homework after they wouldn't have time to enjoy themselves after because it would be dark outside then they have to go to bed.

Second reason is students having time like i said in the other paragraph students wouldn't have time if we had more hours in school. students wouldn;t do fun after homework after school because by the time you know the sun would go down and it would be too late for anything. go out somewhere, play outside, and hang with friends.

Third reason why is because teachers. teachers would have more work in their hands teachers have a life too they need to get to their families too",0
"Likewise, mismatched or disheveled clothes can give off a messy or disorganized impression. 

Personal hygiene is also a big factor in first impressions. A person can influence the impression they make through subtle, yet important, elements of their appearance including facial expression, personal hygiene, and attire. 

Finally, attire has a big impact in a person's first impression as well. Wearing high-quality clothing that fits properly can create a professional and reliable image. Proper attention to facial expression, personal hygiene, and attire can all contribute to a positive initial impression and help determine one's success in life.. 

Overall, the way in which a person presents themselves can have a tremendous effect on the impression they make. 

A person's facial expression can be a great indicator of their attitude and can be extremely influential when making a first impression. People often judge someone based on their appearance, including grooming and proper hygiene. A relaxed, confident expression communicates an open and sincere vibe, while a frown or grimace communicates tension or anger. Dirty or disheveled hair, stained clothing, and body odor, for example, can all give off a negative or sloppy vibe. 
Making a good first impression is essential in any situation, as it sets the tone for any subsequent interactions",1
"For some students are very complicate to extending the school day two hours. Beacuse I think that is not a good idea for all the students, and that can effect because if they working in the afternoon. That's why . I think to extending the school day two hours, that can be something bad, because not all students agree with that, and also that can be something complicated. Because some student have to work in the afternoon,

and others have to do others thing.

I think the benefits and disadvantage to a four-day school week, can be good, but also can be sad.

Becauase not everyone is agree with all this that happens in the school, a four-day school week have good ideas and bad ideas. And i think is better get out early, because some student have something to do, and get out so late is not a good idea for all students.

Some student can be not agree with all this, that extending the school for two hours. For the disagvantage is that we can be out so late, and that is something that not everyone liked, and the benefits is that is only four-day per week. To all student because we can be out to late.

That's why I think that expending the school day two hours is something not very good. But the benefits is that all students only come four-day per week",0
"When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do.

For example:

If yo want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you don't have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and don't complain for any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences.

At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. I'm agree with Emerson's restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I don't have to think too much about it, I believe in what I'm doing. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, you're a guide and an example to change the format in this age. A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing that's material it doesn't have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you having a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interesting in show another face to represent a different type of humanity.

Be an individual person is how you you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with an specific and central idea.

I have a positive and big action to say that Emerson is right because nobody wants to be the shadow of any person or leave an opportunity that will make the life of one or more person to decide to experiment a new way to see the society and doing the correct process to be an excellent human with integrity and feeling of better life.

My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that it's possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will converting on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesn't matter where yo come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth.

"""Succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm"".

-Former British Minister Winston Churchill

Immigrants who came from differents countries to United States are the most strongest people in the world.

These people really know what failure means and how brave they are to leave their families and find the success that they could not get on their countries.

That's the meaning of this statement and I'll explain you why I am agrre with this powerful phrase.

I believe that immigrants who came to United States are the strongest people because they have to do a lot of sacrificies before to come here, for example, some parents live theirs children with their grandparents or take the risk to come with them even knowing how hard is the way to come to America.

Its really difficult to come to a new country without know the lenguage, the city, and what kind of peolpe will you find in the way, some are good persons who helps them some of them are racist, they start from cero without a hosue, a car, a good job, being alone and so far from their families, this is how they get the strength to keep moving up and help their families in their countries.

They are the best example for this statement to teach us how can we start from down in a new place and get the opportunity to be in the top without never give up making clear our goals and purposes,

sometimes we want to do something that we really love but we feel afraid to fail, but if we never try we never going to know how it feels like to see ours dreams realized. If you believe in what you think , then it worths and do not let anyone tell you that you can not.

I'm agree with this statement because it shows us a different way to see what we call difficult or imposible to make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          . When the things are getting hard just think in the price that you will earn at the end or how proud you will be for made that thing that you wanted to do and someone told you that you could not make. Just be as an immigrant, brave, able, capable to risk all that they have to get a new opportunity, a different way of live but always thinking about the yearned price.

I hope you have an idea about this statement means , and do not give up on your dreams and the goals that you made some day thinking about make them reallity and if you always want to triumph you have to spend time on it",0

Nevertheless, graduating early and working for a year before college has proven to be a beneficial experience for many students. Furthermore, the experiences gained from working will help mature students and provide them with skills such as time management that will be invaluable in college. For one, they can take that time to save up money for college costs. 

On the other hand, some may argue that taking a year off to work can be a deterrent to college motivation and preparation. The financial and personal growth opportunities that it provides may ultimately be invaluable to success in college and beyond.. 
Graduating early from high school and working for a year before college can have lasting benefits for students. Although tuition and fees for college are rising year after year, students who work before college and carefully manage their finances can put themselves in a better position to afford college tuition. Students who do choose to graduate early and take a year off before college may not feel adequately prepared for the academic rigor that college demands. And given the competition to get into college, a gap year may cause some potential universities to look unfavorably on a student's application",1
"Churchill was a British statesman most famously known for his leadership during WW2. Despite experiencing a multitude of failures early in his life, he refused to give in and kept pushing himself forward, ultimately becoming one of Britain's most legendary figures. Remind readers that a success story is more than just endings and that the path to success is likely to be filled with setbacks. However, his successes as a politician did not come easy. Point out the detrimental mental, emotional, and physical effects of allowing the persistence of failure to cause someone to give up. Finally, encourage readers that re-centering and recalibrating after failure is a normal part of life and essential for anyone seeking to reach their goals. But that student must remember Churchill’s advice and take courage in the knowledge that failure can lead to success if it is met with dedication and consistency. 
Sir Winston Churchill remains a powerful example of perseverance and success despite failure. Through researching the achievements of Winston Churchill and exploring a hypothetical scenario, it has become clear that the courage to continue despite failure is the only way to experience lasting success.. 

On a personal or professional level, it is important to remain consistent and not give up after failure. A student is struggling to pass a difficult college course and has already failed the course four times. His famous quote, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”, emphasizes the importance of not giving up in the face of difficulty, instead persevering and striving for success.

To understand better how to continue striving in the face of repeated failure, let’s examine a hypothetical scenario. It would be easy for the student to become disheartened and give up, especially with the overwhelming challenge of preparing for and taking yet another exam. 

To support not losing enthusiasm after failure, an essay should emphasize that life is full of challenges and how failure is inextricably linked to success",1
"From Thomas Jefferson's famous maxim that encouraged citizens to ""never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today,"" an active and industrious spirit has been fundamental to our success. But if history has taught us anything, it's that idle behavior comes with a price. Unfortunately, this has had dire consequences more than once, leading to tragic consequences and lost opportunities.

Today, technology has made it easier than ever to live an idle lifestyle. However, the flip side of this mentality has been the risk of becoming too passive and idle in our society.  So let us take his words as a reminder to stay active and seize the day so that we can create a better future and leave behind a lasting legacy.. We can use our devices to make our lives easier and put off taking action until tomorrow, or even until next week. Such a mindset will not only help us reach our individual goals more efficiently but will also benefit the country as a whole. Taking Thomas Jefferson’s words to heart, we must not be afraid to invest our time and energy into something today rather than waiting until tomorrow. 
Throughout American history, the push for active thought and behavior has been a key factor in our nation's progress. From everyday people to entire nations, an idle lifestyle can often lead to stagnation, which often leads to missed opportunities and, in some cases, a complete reversal of fortune.

In order to avoid a similar fate and ensure a prosperous future, active behavior must remain at the forefront of our minds",1

"After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.

Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. She really enjoyed it. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill.

I've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what i'm currently playing. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In my case, Its music. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.

My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.

My music skills have yet to improve, but until then I will continue trying new ways of music.. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters' birthday. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. Everyone has a talent or skill. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra",0
"As teens comply with a curfew, this ensures that they are able to attend school on time and refreshed and are better able to focus and achieve their academic goals. Additionally, setting a curfew can help to promote a positive school culture that promotes respect and encourages teens to take their studies and future goals seriously. By requiring teenagers to be in their homes by a certain time of night, this decreases the chances of teens participating in illegal activities, such as underage drinking and drug use. 

Local government can also benefit from the enforcement of curfews for teens. Curfews can also help to ensure that teens are not disrupting their local neighborhoods with loud music or unruly behavior after dark. Teenagers have curfews set in place, families can feel more secure that their children are in safe environments and are not engaging in risky activities. Similarly, it helps to decrease traffic related incidents which can have considerable impacts on a local community. 

In conclusion, the enforcement of curfews for teenagers can have a range of positive impacts, from a more secure family environment to a stronger school culture. 

Finally, enforcing curfews for teens can have positive impacts for schools. Firstly, a curfew can have an especially positive effect on families. Curfews can also help to ensure that children are completing their homework and getting adequate rest, leading to positive relationships between families. As teens have a greater sense of structure and security, this encourages stronger communities to form within a society. 
Enforcing a curfew for teenagers can have numerous positive impacts that ripple throughout families, local government, society, and schools. As a result, setting curfews can be an effective tool in helping teenagers to stay safe, secure, and academically successful.. 

The positive impacts of enforcing curfews for teenagers can also be felt more broadly in society",1
"While technology can be used as a tool for self-expression and productivity, there are also serious risks associated with the misuse of this power. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their children are developing essential social skills, such as communication and problem-solving, and to limit the use of technology in order to benefit their children in the long run.. This is especially the case for young people, who are heavily influenced by the media they are exposed to in day-to-day life. 

In the modern age, technology has had a simultaneously beneficial and damaging effect on social relations. Social media platforms have provided opportunities to stay connected with acquaintances and make new friends, while at the same time making it easier to live alone and engage in cyberbullying",1

After school programs have become increasingly popular for both students and teachers. Through creative, hands-on learning, students stay ahead in their classes and gain a better understanding of their overall academic performance. Through after school programs, students and teachers have the chance to volunteer to help others understand or finish tasks, which not only reinforces their knowledge but also promotes camaraderie and team-building skills. 

Overall, having an after school program is a beneficial endeavor for both students and teachers. For teachers, after school programs can provide unique perspectives on certain topics that can be applied in their classroom materials. These programs offer the ability for both students and teachers to apply the knowledge they have gained throughout the school day, something that is essential for career and academic success. Not only do they provide students and teachers with the opportunity to learn new material, but they also allow for the chance to gain better grades on quizzes and tests. It encourages knowledge application, promotes career and academic success, and allows students and teachers the opportunity to cultivate skills they may not possess in the classroom setting.. 

Having an after school program provides crucial insight into real-world scenarios and fosters students’ extracurricular abilities. It presents students with essential leadership and problem-solving skills that help them excel beyond a learning environment",1
"I now feel empowered to express myself freely and without judgement. Doing hard work at my job has also opened up new opportunities for my career and has allowed me to advance more quickly.

No matter what the context is, I believe that demonstrating hard work and staying true to who you are can be an effective way to show yourself and the world that you are capable and resilient. 
It is important to be true to yourself and to be honest about who you are and what you stand for. 

Personally, when I worked hard in college to achieve a difficult course, it made me realize that with the right effort and dedication, I was capable of anything. Achieving that course solidified my confidence in myself and pushed me to follow my passions. Doing hard work and challenging yourself can be a way to prove who you are and to build confidence in yourself. By working hard to exceed expectations I am able to show that I am trustworthy and dependable and that I take my work seriously. Doing so can not only benefit you, but can help to inspire those around you too.. In a world full of people who try to blend in and conform, it is important to stay true to your unique identity. 

The same principle can be applied professionally",1
"Instead of feeling discouraged and giving up, embracing these challenges and failure-driven learning experiences can help one to reach their goals and elevate their personal growth.. 

Whatever challenges we face in life, there’s always valuable lessons to be learnt from our mistakes or failures. Unfortunately, I failed to get the desired score in one test and felt like I let myself down. I was determined to prove that I could do better and eventually I surpassed all expectations and graduated at the top of my class. 

For example, when I was in school, I put a lot of pressure on myself to get the best grades possible and be the valedictorian of my class. This painful experience pushed me to work harder and turn my disappointment into motivation. This experience taught me to stay positive and use failures as a motivation to persevere. 
Failure is an essential part of the learning process as it helps us grow more resilient and empowered. It is important to remain positive and motivated when life throws us challenges and to use experiences of failure as learning opportunities to make us better and closer to achieving our goals",1
"No longer do students have to be cooped up in a traditional classroom; now they can choose to study from the comfort of their own home, or even from a cafe or library in their hometown. 
Distance learning provides students with many benefits compared to traditional classes. This makes learning more convenient and accessible to a variety of students.. With distance learning, no matter where a student is or when they are available, they can attend and complete their courses. This makes it easier for students who for various reasons cannot attend physical classes on time, or who are unable to attend every day.

Also, when a student opts for distance learning, they can attend classes from anywhere. One key advantage is that students can attend classes on their own time",1
"By achieving meaningful goals, students become better equipped to build confidence and a positive self-image. A focus on achieving allows students to build self-confidence in the long-term, while praising can provide a short-term improvement in morale. By providing meaningful praise and setting achievable goals, students can increase their self-confidence and develop a positive self-image.. It also motivates them, making it easier for the student to achieve their goals.

However, other educators stress the importance of focusing on achievement rather than praise. But, when excessive, praising can also create doubts in students’ ability and cause them to become dependent on praise. 

When it comes to building self-esteem with students, both praising and achieving have both notable benefits and drawbacks. They argue that praising encourages students to strive for excellence and appreciate their strengths. When it comes to analyzing the effectiveness of these two methods, opinions are often divided. 
One popular method of building self-esteem in students is to employ either praise or a focus on achieving. Similarly, too much emphasis on achievement can result in students becoming fixated on perfectionism, placing unrealistic standards on themselves. 

While opinions may vary, research suggests that a balanced approach which combines both praising and achieving is the most effective way of building self-esteem in students. Some educators believe that praising is more effective and has a greater impact on a student’s self-esteem. This allows them to feel proud of their accomplishments and generates a rewarding sense of satisfaction",1
"for example if i did something what i keep in my mind and I try to get back the time and now is to late is something what I can't do now I will fell like I help others to don't do what is wrong and they life. when the author will writing something he get the all information he can can fist and then stars with the the important part to proud the feeling to reading that story.

"I guess because one person is determinate they have goals and dreams, and the person work hard for complement all something,when the person have a purpose though, tired or think you cant ,there are in you a voice said you can do it , at that moment yuo think i needed for my life, family . my diari life is a example because my goals is take my higschools diploma but i need work hard because , walk up 6 in the morning , preparate breakfast for everything in my family , then i needed take my thing necessary for my work , i working all day , to go out 5 pm then came for the schools night , i have for class for a years , sometimes i tired but , remember my family , what example given for my daugther , only work hard , to achieve my goals .. is more essay when the person have determinate direction , when the person not have anything in the life , I think its necessary that person to be linked with family, friends who is motivation for him or she",0
"because the school doesnt think about the students family or what they got going on at that time they just want to boss the kids around and tell the students to go ot not go.. then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activties and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you dont have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends.

but i think the school should give the students and thier faimly diffrent choices of extracurricular activties so the students can pick 2 or 3 diffrent types of them instead of not having time for thier own life. To begin with, in my opinion i think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activties. or if you want to do great in school or in any job and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activites.

Second of all, if the parents dont think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activites and if you dont have enough time for study sessions or you homework because your to tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do or they can pick the ones that's going to help them the most in the future of school or in thier adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activites that they learned or did so they wont have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money and you can also get money if you help someone that doesnt know how to do that type of thing.

And thats why i think it should be the students and parents choice if the students want to or not do extracurricular activities. and why im saying this is because the school does not have no right to tell you you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school asignments or afterschool studying then i suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it",0
"
Studies have shown that teamwork can be beneficial for students in a variety of different ways. In addition, studies have found that working in teams can improve a student's self-esteem and foster a sense of belonging, while reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness. Collaboration in the classroom can also help to create a more engaging and enjoyable learning experience. Working in a group or team provides more opportunities to think critically, develop problem-solving skills, and become aware of different perspectives. While working as a group may not always be the most efficient way to complete a task, the benefits that can be gained from the experience often outweigh the drawbacks.. Working with a group can also help students gain a better understanding of the material they are studying, as well as generate new ideas for projects and assignments",1
"On the one hand, the added school time could result in students having more time to devote to learning and preparation for standardized tests. 

The school board's proposal to add an additional hour and a half to the school day has sparked much debate. It is important to weigh all factors and perspectives, as well as carefully consider how best to make use of the students’ time, both in the classroom and out.. Furthermore, this extra time could mean that students have even less time to complete homework assignments at home.

Some argue that the additional hour and a half of schooling should be added as it could improve educational outcomes. However, it could also have a negative impact on their lives. However, others maintain that this additional time could be put to better use outside of the classroom. They believe that students should be able to find their own ways of finding balance between study and extracurricular activities.

Ultimately, there is no clear-cut solution to the dilemma. The additional time spent in school could lead to fewer hours available for extracurricular activities, as well as lead to disruptive changes in students’ daily routines",1
"These distractions can be difficult to ignore, and may lead to a lack of time spent focused on their studies. Without the more immediate help, assignments such as homework and projects may become more difficult for students to complete. As a result, they could fall behind other students and find it more difficult to keep up with their studies. Financial aid and scholarships would be much less beneficial to distance learning students who don’t attend an in-person class, and student loan guidelines are often inflexible. 
Distance learning classes allow students to receive education from the comfort of their own home. As such, students should carefully consider all of the drawbacks associated with distance learning classes before making the decision to attend such classes from home.. The most notable drawbacks of distance learning classes are issues with distractions, homework struggles, and financial hardship. Common distractions can include siblings, pets, television, computers, and mobile phones. This is due to students being unable to ask their teacher for help in real-time. 

Finally, distance learning classes could potentially increase financial difficulties for students. However, there are some arguments to consider when debating whether or not such classes are an appropriate substitute for traditional schooling. 

First, there are a higher number of potential distractions for students attending distance learning classes from home. With students already facing tuition and book costs, the lack of assistance provided by distance learning classes may lead to less economic support. These instances of distraction and procrastination can lead to a decrease in academic performance. 

Second, homework struggles can be more present in virtual classrooms compared to traditional classrooms. This could lead to additional stress and further strain on a student’s budget. 

In conclusion, distance learning classes are not the ideal learning environment for students, considering factors such as distractions, homework struggles, and financial issues",1
"For students with jobs, distance learning allows them to complete school work around their work schedule, meaning they can manage both without feeling overwhelmed. 

Furthermore, distance learning can provide more time for homework, rest, job-related activities, and visiting other places. 
Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for high school students, offering a variety of benefits. This means that students may have more access to more specialized courses that may help them achieve their educational and professional goals. For those needing last-minute credits, distance learning provides the flexibility to take classes outside of traditional school hours. Additionally, for students with physical or psychological disabilities, distance learning provides the ideal learning environment that caters to their individual needs. Not only that, but distance learning can also open up opportunities for students to gain knowledge and experience in topics they may not have been exposed to while in a regular school setting. With the right resources and support, distance learning can give students the opportunity to develop their skills and fulfill their ambitions.",1
"Albert Einstein said "" Imagination is more important that knowledge"" do I agree with Albert Einstein or do i disagree I picked agree and I'm going to tell you why I picked it.

Reason one imagination is all about being creative like thinking about stuff to do and stuff to wear and writing a song you got to use your imagination and speaking you got to use your imagination just to know what your about to say before you even say the word.

Reason two Albert Einstein used his imagination to be really smart and creative. Also people who invented stuff they used their imagination and not only that they made millions just by using there imagination, and construction workers got to use there own imagination just to construct a big buildings and houses.

Reason three you can make money from just using your imagination I seen people make lots of money just selling stuff they made at there own homes and seen so many companies go from not making anything like money to being this really large company that made millions just from using there imagination.

And thats why i agree with Albert Einstein saying ""Imagination is more important than knowledge""",0
"Supporters of a curfew law claim that it can help decrease juvenile crime, improve public safety, and help young people focus on studies and other extracurricular activities. 
The implementation of a curfew law for teenagers is a highly debated topic. Opponents of the law contend that it is an infringement of civil liberties and can potentially be damaging to the relationship and trust between parents and teenagers. It is also essential to consider the potential effects on the relationship between youth and law enforcement, the financial impact it may have on city budgets, and how the law would be viewed by community members. Additionally, there is also concern that a curfew law could disproportionately affect teens of color.

In order to effectively evaluate the pros and cons of implementing a curfew law for teenagers in a given city, it is important to consider the implications of the law, its potential effects on teenagers, and how it would be enforced. Ultimately, the decision to implement a curfew law should not be taken lightly and should be carefully considered before taking effect.",1
"I couldn't of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had.               . Your help wouldn't go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in.

The dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldn't be a problem at all. I would be able to develop the skills you guide me in and also by keeping me on track. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. By leading me in the right path, and by not doing something I am not sure about and letting that go to waste. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them.

Once the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work I have put in and also being sure with what career I want in my future, I would gain more passion and inspiration. May you please give me the opportunity to suceed? I would love to have your help by keeping me on track to my future. ""I want to be a singer!"", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success.

In fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. I wouldn't want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. This would help me to push until I have accomplished everything I have worked for. With that being said it would be a huge honor if I you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me.

While many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. The road this company would lead me in would help me become successful. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. With the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, I may become one the greatest artist in this generation.

I am hoping you really consider the motivation I have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world.

With that being said, It would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in my career with your help",0
"When they enter middle school and that when students from elementary school start thinking about their choice and taking their career choice serious ,because that when they start thinking what they want to do in the near future. Students committing to a career is a great idea when you really want to do it .

Committing to career

When elementary students are in 5th grade they start carefully thinking about what they are gonna do,

because when they are in 5th grade it their last year in elementary school so they have to think about what they want to do. Elementary students have 4 years where they take class that are chosen for them in the 4 years they study just to get good grade ,but they do not think about choosing the class for themselves .But when it comes to 5th grade they still study the class that are chosen for them except that when they start to think what if I could choose the class that I want to study for my career or what kind job I am going to study to be able to get that job and that how they start committing to a career .when it comes to elementary school students.

Middle school students are commit to career because they are teens and they have to think about a lot of things that they want to do personally when it comes to career or what they want to be when they grow up that when they start .Committing to career start in elementary , but mostly it begins for real in middle school because that when young teens start taking class like algebra,earth science,biology ,world history, etc . These days they are unstoppable for what they do sometimes they are good more than adult at committing to career when it comes to what they want to do in life.

Some people might argue that students identify a career by the time they enter high school , because they think some students can not do that when it comes to committing to career they think that young teens can not do it .Because technology has taken the mind of teens .They say that teens can not do anything because all they think about is technology and all the things they do they always use technology so some people do not believe that teens these day can commit to anything i .Many people believe that it is hard for teens to commit ,because they can not take responsible of what they do and some think that they are so imature .When it comes to committing to career the parents thinks it how they act at home that why they can not commit to career and some thinks it how they behavior when they are in school .Some people believe that teens can not commit to a career ,because they do not know what to do and some thinks that young teens can not do it because they changes their mind most of their time on settling on what they want to do .Bunch of people believe that teenager can not do it because they quite so early and so easily anyway a lot people do say that can can not be a good generation because they do not know what to do.

But it doe not mean that all teenager are bad some might change when they grow up and some might not change ,because they just do not want to change consoling the thing they might have gone through so for these people. From elementary to middle school students are allowed to choose what they want to study toward a specific career or what they want to be. But when it comes to middle school students they can choose what class they want to take for a specific career they have in mind .

Student can commit to a career when they enter high school , but they do that when the student already know what they want to be or what they want to do by the time they enter high school so the student at they would be committing to what the student want to do so the person doing so chooses the class the person want to study . Who believe that some teens can not commit might be wrong because people change teenager hood do change as well

.

For these who believe in change I as well believe in change people do change and they can commit to what they want to commit to as well as job, career,family or love. So keep believing in what you want to commit to because once you found it I know for sure whatever it is you will success ,because we you teens work hard for our dream.. When kids are still in elementary they can say what they want to be, but they can not choose the class for the specific reason because they are still kids. Students committing to a career when they about to enter high school is by far a great idea. When looking you will find a lot teens thinking about their career .The career they want to commit to and some teens do change want they want to be , but still they are committing to it and they can just change if they do not want to do it .For some reasons young teens around the world that are still in middle school are already commit to a career and that is a good thing right most of them are really into it , and they are taking their career far enough .So far like 10,00 teens are most famous because of their career that they are doing now and they take serious because they like and they are good at it mostly middle school teens. When middle school students start taking these class students think only about passing so that they can not repeat that class and some just want to pass the class but mostly it about passing the class so that they can be able to get credit, and that leads to taking the class the will help that person career or what kind of career they are into. People believe in what they want to believe in so I say that commit takes responsible ,but I know that we teenager can change the world and show them that not all teens are the same and keep believing in what career you want to commit to because committing is not an easy thing to do expressly when you are a young teen or kids .I know people say that we can commit to what we want ,but not everyone is good at committing to a career when it comes to young and committing to something that is big than your own head or mind",0
"For instance, through connected medical devices, people can receive tailored medical care, including remote health monitoring and early diagnosis of health concerns. For example, mobile health technology can enable doctors to provide remote care and advice to people, even from a distance. This technology can create a stronger sense of physical and social freedom for people with disabilities that would otherwise be unable to receive an education or work in many industries.

Finally, communication technology can help create connections with family, friends, and strangers around the world, regardless of physical distance. Additionally, communication technology can benefit people in emergency situations and provide better medical response times. By utilizing these tools, people can have access to quality health care, even if they can't visit a doctor in person.

Another way that technology can improve people's lives is through improved accessibility. 
Technology has the potential to make a tremendous positive impact on people's lives in a variety of ways. Additionally, telehealth programs can provide people with routine care and diagnoses to manage chronic conditions. 

In conclusion, technology has the potential to significantly improve people's lives in numerous ways, including through improved remote health care, better accessibility for people with disabilities, and stronger connections with individuals from around the world. Advanced assistive technologies, such as voice recognition software, can enable people with physical limitations to communicate more efficiently, while computer-aided reading programs can provide an opportunity to gain knowledge without the need to physically visit a library. By exploring all of the ways technology can make a positive difference, people can better understand the current and potential future benefits of advances in technology.. Mobile health devices, such as wearable technology, can allow doctors to monitor patient activity and receive real-time data on patient health, which can provide valuable insight into the patient's overall health status. Through social media, people can communicate and share experiences without the need to physically meet someone",1
"Some enviroment make you satify where you at.

Being happy with where you at is not a bad thing but the more you explored the more you grow in life. Without explore you will never know what you are cable of and you will never grow in life. For example If Bill Gate was satify what he master with out exploring he would had never become a billionaire and he would never discovered the microsoft. The more you explore the farther you go in life. And if

Barack Obama was satify with his education/knowledge he would never had became a Senator or the first Black

African American president of America and he was never going to be able to share is idea with America .So with out going beyond what you have mastered you will never know who you are and what you are cable of. The more you explore the more you learn about life and where it will take you.. For example if your boss is leave and they are looking for a new replacement for his/her position and you have knowledge/idea about the job, but you decided embrace where you are because you are scared to take a step in life. He is also right because where Iam from lot of people are satify where they in life life.

I believe that the more you explore the more you grow. And you also have the mind set that they will turn you down. Some people in college are comfortable having there master degree but scared to get their doctorate degree because they feel that having their masters degree is the stopping point of their learning skills and they are not smart enough to get their doctorare degree. You will never discovered your worth/talent with out trying. It is alway good to go beyond your comfort zone and explore new thing. Always pray to advanced to a new level not the level you have master. My mom alway tell me never be happy where you at step out of your comfort zone and explored.

So you will know who you truly are. like Neil Armstrong Said "" a gaint leap for man kind"" some people need to take that gaint leap in their life. I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because some people are comfortable where they are. It good to be satify where you are sometime, But when emergency come to need to explore to see who you truly are. Some people have that mind set that if they explore they will never make it. Never be happy with who you are alway fight for a better future on a better life. Explore beyond what you have mastered and there will alway be a suprise , a new talent and a new growth in life",0
"Just don't overthink about yourself, and just do not forget about other who you have.. So you have to think about others like; family, parents, brothers or sisters, grandparents, collagues (sometime), friends when they helping me in some situation and after that I do care. When you have a job at business office or somewhere else, they will watch you how you behave, why they should higher you, handel your working and etc. And ""it's about teamwork not a selfish"" if you decide to ignore and don't even trying to helping your team members, what kind of person they will think about you as team member, but if you will help your team, well then.... For example if you are in team or more than that, when you participate your members may asking quiestios to solve the problems, what are the planes for next few weeks we will do, or projects. push yourself and at least do your best to succeed. I disagree with Emerson statement about individuality, because you can't think about only yourself, I mean sometimes but not everytime like me, me, me and nothing else bised yourself",0
"Until this moment I am thankful with my teacher, because of her, we changed to a better score, because of her we believe more in ourselves, she just wanted our best, but sometimes we made her get angry, because we did not believed in ourselves. Some time later many of us had changed, as we changed, we saw that our teacher changed too. My father was devastated, he was looking for a job amost for three months, and he could not find any job to pay the rent, so we would not lose the house. The second quater passed, and the students were happy because their score in the algebra class, many students's score were from 50 to 90, it happened because all us changed our attitude in different manners. For that experience that I had, I think that possitive attitude is something extremely important in every human life.

Our attitude has to be always positive, even in the worst moment of our life.

Some people think that a person should have a positive attitude just during a very important moment, or in happy moments, this is not correct, they all are wrong, we need to have a possitive attitude always in order to succeed in life, and to be happy. In my opinion attitude should be always positive, because it can help you to succeed in work, can encourage people to do their best, even if what they have to do is hard to do it, and it can be a great tool in order to succeed in relationships, and believed in yourself.

When I was working in Mango Paradise, my boss was a really bitter person, that was always angry with everyone in the work, but I was one person that I didn't care about his bad attitude toward us, I was always with a big smile, perhap how he treated us. He was so thankful with us because how we supported him in that bad moments that wanted to increase our salary, many of us accepted, but many others not. Unfortunate, his wife pass away, and as I said to him, we were there all the time supporting him, we were there with a positive attitude telling him, that everything will be okay, that his wife is gonna be in a better place where can rest in peace, where she will not suffer more. There was a time in my family where we had a problem of money, my father got fired on his work, we almost lose the house where we were living, because we did not paid the rent in almost four months. In the first quater many of us in our class period failed. We paid more attention as we should since the beginning of the year, we started to believe in us, we started to do things even if we didn't know how to do it. He found a new job where he earn a little bit more than his previous job, so our money's problem disappear.

Believe in yourself not always is easy, some times we though that is difficult to understand yourself, but there is always a lovely person that help you to believed in how strong you are, and to see all the thing that you are capable to do. It was because our teacher talked with us, and made us to believe that we can do anything that we want to do. That is why until this moment she is one of my favorite teacher, and I think that for my other classmates she is too. We though that our score would never change. As every wife do, my mom came to him and said ""Do not worry sweetheart, we can get out of this problem as we always do, I am here to support you"". My father almost immediately changed his attitude, he gave to my mom a big smile and said to her "" Thanks babe to be always with me, and for trust on me"", he get up take the keys of the car, and went out to look for another job. Do you think positive attitude is a key that everyone need in order to be a successful person in life? In my essay I will talk about positive attitude, if it is important or not. There was one day that he had a bad day, because one member of his family was in the hospital, and was very delicate, he was an a mood that did not look like he was the same one, he was sad, he was devastated, and worried, because the person that was in the hospital was his wife, she had cancer. After that many student changed their attitude, but it was not because we wanted. He really change since that days, that many of us, we are still working there, and earning more money than we regurlarly earned.

In every human life, there is always a hard problem, that make us to give up, but there is also a person with a positive attitude that makes us to get up, and continue with our life. In our homes old people as grandmother, grandfather, sibblings and parents, need to give the example, so kids will take it, and they will be confident and a positive person.. So, that same day I asked him if we may talk, he said "" Yes"", I just wanted to talk with him and tell him that perhap everything, we were there to support him in everything he needed. We changed, all of us did, and she became for me the most good person as a teacher and as a friend, she was always supporting us, and teaching us. When I was in 10 grade, I had an algebra teacher that was always telling us that we had to believed more in ourselves, sometimes we did not do what she asked us to do, because we did not understand, many of us were disappointed of ourselves, because we didn't even try to do it",0

"It's really exciting because all that hard work was worth it, and you made it, but to get through you had to give up many of the activities you liked as well as your time. Instead, students would have to attend to school, do homework, study for tests, and quizzes. Finishing early can be very stressful for students.

Students finishing high school in three years must take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Also, finishing one year early can be stressful for students. Schools should not offer students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early.. Students would need to take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Imagine yourself getting out of high school early, and going to college or the workforce. This required classes are also important when getting into a college. That is why it's not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early. In order for students to graduate, they have to take required classes. However, it can be very stressful for students. Additionally, students have to do projects, and presentations. Students have to study for all of their classes, do homework at home, and keep up with their classwork, so they won't get behind. Many students work over the summer, and having to take classes would not give them time to get a job. Similarly, if students take classes in the evenings, and want to be enrolled in sports, or clubs, which require students to stay after school. They would not be able to participate.

If students finish high school early, they may not be able to take elective classes. This would enable students to be enrolled in elective classes like art, drama, music, or photography.

Some people may say that students finishing high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early, it's a good idea. Many students may not be able to take elective classes. Students would not be able to take elective classes. Having to take all the classes they need, can barely fit into their schedules. All of these can stress students a lot, and won't have time for their own.

It's not a good idea for students to finish high school, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students must take classes during the summer",0
"Dear Principal

I think we students should at least have a B average to play sports, that would make it fair for who tries their best in school, but i bet that those who really love sports would try their best in all their classes. Students who do not try their be st and don't like sports they could just stay with whatever grade they get because they deserve it. All students have to do is listen in class and pass all the test that teachers give out so you could pass the class and be able to pass your class and you'll be able to play what ever sport you want.

Students and people who try their best will always get everything they want because they do everything said and everything they tell them to do. Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If you try your best you will get to play sports and join in activities you like. doing everything they ask you to do will make you a good person. Your decision depends on you if you make a good decision you will get what you want if you don't you don't get everything that you want.

Love,

STUDENT_NAME. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade.

If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average",0
"Students and parents should weigh the benefits of taking an online class against the potential drawbacks in order to determine which option is best for them.. As we move deeper into the 21st century, more and more students and parents are questioning whether online courses can provide an adequate educational experience for high school students. 
In today's digital world, it is no surprise that online classes have become increasingly popular among high school students. Additionally, online classes often provide additional resources like student-led discussion boards and forums which can be a great way for students to connect with peers and get the kind of support they might not get in a traditional classroom environment.

On the other hand, the lack of face-to-face interaction and the potential for distraction are two drawbacks of taking online courses. For students, having no peers or teachers around for support can be a challenge. For parents, not being able to physically monitor their children's progress in the classroom can be a source of worry. Additionally, distractions such as watching TV or playing video games while taking an online class can lead to lower grades and incomplete assignments.

Overall, it is clear that online classes can provide an appropriate educational experience for high school students, but it is important to consider the pros and cons before making a decision. 

On the one hand, the flexibility that online courses offer is attractive to both students and parents. As a matter of fact, there are both advantages and disadvantages to taking online classes. For students, who often have competing demands on their time, being able to attend classes from the comfort of their own home can be a huge benefit. For parents, the comfort of knowing that their children are not in a physical classroom environment can be a relief",1
"Idle people are lazy, because they don't want to try out new things. I got tired of been idle, so I told my mother that I wanted to something instead of been idle. I started training with new people, and I made a lot of friends.

Instead of been idle, why can't we spend more time with our books? The more we go close to our books the more we learn faster, and increase our skills in reading; for example, my friend Generic_Name, his parents never wanted him to hang out with friends that much, or neither been idle without having his book to read. Although some says that inactivity serve a purpose, because the can get more time to them selves then when they are in activities, actually determine never to be idle, because we can accomplish many things; If we are always doing somethings such as involving in activities, having more time with our book, and trying out new things.

It had been writing by Thomas Jefferson "" Determine never to be idle "". We were sitting at home idly doing nothing; until when Generic_Name suggested that we should go and try out the UFC GYM. It is very true that some many people and students are always idle; they don't use their time wisely. Generic_Name kept on spending most of his time reading his books for a long time, and he became a good reader in his English classroom. We went there, and signed up for the training; they gave us a one day trail to see if we would like the training. We can do a lot if we involved our selves in activities instead of been idle; for example, when I came to the United States in January 8,2017. You can do a lot if you try out new things. I wanted to sign up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, so that I can get busy with my time, and use it wisely. try out new things when ever you are idle. You can learn a lot even if you are not perfect; for example, me and my three friends Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name. The teacher always asked him to read out story books and passages to his classmates in school. I encourage every idle human and people who thinks inactivity server a purpose to get engage in activities, having more time with their books, and trying out new things when ever they feel like they are idle. We went there the next day and started training for one hour; after training I told my friends that I don't like the training, because it was gave me back pains, so I quit the gym, and my three stayed in the training, because they like it. I was sitting at home for two months without going to school, and doing nothing. We can accomplish more if we are always doing somethings; therefore, determine never to be idle.. He inspired many students in his school, and most students wanted to be like him, so they started having more time with their books at home.

In addition, people who wanted to be idle, or people who think inactivity serve a purpose are people who are not determine, and not planing on their future; they don't want to involve in activities, or interact with people. I finally signed up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, and I got accepted by the coach. I was not perfect, but I tired out a new thing and I got some experiences from it.

As a result of all the reasons and examples",0
"It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools

In conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. . But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school.

To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . Let's make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework.

In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Students needs time with friends and family. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country.

Yet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. As you can see,

students could not have time to play and do their homework",0
"In addition they will know their way around. Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings.

Many people may succeed when they try new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience.

Many people grow by trying new things.             . In addition people will get better at what they do. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better.

Finally people gain more experience. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. People will be more educated in that topic and help others.

While many people think you can not grow. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. Working Beyond

Do you need to work beyond what you have mastered to grow? Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

In conclusion people who go above and beyond grow because they have done more to help them grow and become better and to succeed. People will become more successful. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. You should try and go beyond and see if you grown",0
"All the knowledge that my dad have now is by the failure. All the failued that you took make you work harder and do way better. I try doing different way to learn. He have learn that he should do what his job more better and do what the customer said.

Some people said that you don't need a failure to become successful, but they are wrong. Thats what make us do better in life. . Some times was because the customer din't like the work.

Now he know that he should do the work as the customer said and do the work better. In this essay, I will argue about the important role failure plays in people success. Thats what make a person successful.

Failure is something that all of us do. That why we have become successful in something in are life. He never loss his enthusiasm to make his company better, years over years. My success of riding a bike was based on failure that teach me different way to learn something and better.

My dad have a company that he have work hard and a lot to archive what he have now. Success comes from failure that make you have knowledge. A failure can teach you lessons to do better that last time. In the future, I hope people learn more from their failure to be successful in what they want to archive in their life. Sometimes he have lost a lot of money, or work for free, because he din't do what the customer said. If we all ignore are failure, we would keep failing over and over. I away fail trying to ride it, but i never stop trying. people that become success is because they have failure a lot of time during the process, and they work harder each time to do it better.

When someone success in something, they had failure in something one time in their career. For example, when I was 10 years old, i couldn't ride a bike. Maybe the fail they took in their career is what make them successful. They knew, if they dont work harder they wouldn't do any better. That why a lot of people said that never gave up just for a fail that you can have. Do you think that you need to fail over and over to become success",0

For older students, seeking to finish or further their education that may have been disrupted due to various reasons, distance learning provides a unique environment to access a wide range of courses. Moreover, with the support of online resources and teachers, students have access to learning materials and guidance regardless of their location.

Overall, distance learning provides a variety of advantages for students, especially those who have to take care of their children, or lack significant family support. It also makes tertiary education much more accessible to poverty-stricken areas, as well as those who may not have the funds to attend traditional learning settings. On top of this, distance learning fees are usually much lower than traditional classroom tuition. Distance learning allows students to continue their studies without traditional college classrooms, making it ideal for those who are balancing full-time jobs or family commitments. 
    Distance learning has grown in popularity in recent years and provides a world of opportunities for students of all backgrounds. For some, these financial savings can be critical – especially for those without a financial safety net. They can do this at their own pace, allowing them to complete their studies in their own time. The impact of distance learning on students is undeniable – it is a crucial tool that empowers individuals to pursue their educational goals.",1

"Despite the fear of failure that hinders many teens, failure itself has its pros and cons. 
The teenage years are often seen as a time of exploration and testing limits. 

At the end of the day, failure as a teen is unavoidable. However, failure is an inevitable consequence of life. In some cases, a teen that experiences failure could find their hopes and aspirations dashed. How one chooses to tackle the situation and learn from it will have powerful implications for the future. It is important to remember that everyone has at least one failure in their life and the key is to know how to use this to one’s advantage. Failing as a teen gives an individual the opportunity to identify their weaknesses and grow from it. It forces teens to assess themselves, build self-awareness, and consider how to improve their skills or approach. 

On the positive side, failure can make someone a better person. This self-reflection and insight can be invaluable in later life.

On the other hand, failure as a teen can have profound ramifications. It is during this time that youths can explore their passions and interests, without consequence. It can also lead to a feeling of being “stuck” or “broken” and thus unable to move forward. As uncomfortable as a lesson in failure may be, it can create emotional maturity and humility. With the right mindset and guidance, failure can be a fantastic teacher and provide opportunities to become a better person.. Many teens take failure personally, letting it shape their self-confidence and their views of the world and their future",1

So in order to achieve these goals, it's important to have some motivation. This could be something like having positive thoughts or asking yourself what the rewards are if you succeed.

"However, committing to a career too early can be detrimental to personal growth. Therefore, committing to a career at a young age can be a substantial decision and it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons.. 
Committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and drawbacks. On the positive side, an early commitment can help to focus your education and give you an impetus to work hard towards your chosen goal. Young people tend to be particularly energetic and motivated and so can focus on their career ambitions early on. Furthermore, you may change your mind as you get older and find it harder to adjust to a different career. You may miss out on trying new activities and exploring different paths",1
"
For many students, there are advantages and disadvantages to identifying a career at a young age. Early determination of a career may allow for a student to develop important skills such as ambition, focus, and organization, as well as the ability to manage their time efficiently. However, students may face challenges such as deciding too soon what career to pursue or struggling to find opportunities in their chosen field. 

Parents and schools play a crucial role in helping students make this decision. Parents may also lend guidance, offering their own experiences or suggestions on what may be a good fit for their child.

It's also important to note that different circumstances, such as economic background, can hugely influence students' career decision-making process. The availability of resources, transportation, and educational opportunities can have dramatic effects on a student's ability to pursue their desired career path. Ultimately, it is important for students to access a variety of information to make an informed decision when determining a career.. When it comes to career planning, schools provide resources such as potential college or vocational school paths",1

"I recommend these for the principal to listen all the opinion are students said, when the menu change we dont got any issue or complain from student because that will affect the change of the menu because the principal take the decison in him self.

However if in case the principal convince about this i will give some examples about my opinion and what i agree to have a new lunch menu i support all my data because i want the school to change the lunch menu.

whatever happen about student reaction for the new menu the principal how to know have control in the students because that be a big deal if not be prepared or make a bad decision somehow the principal will prepared to fixed correctly and faster and improve a good resource for all student, but my opinion is to make all this happen because we need the school change and give attention all the opinion of all the students.

Finally we are welcome to have a new lunch menu, and we will enjoy the change what our school give to us, and for all.

The principal made are all students comfort in the cafeteria and give new menu all the students will be great and celebrate to have a change in their school and the principal need to do that action.. First i imagine if my school change the lunch menu i think that will be great for students, i agree to school have new lunch menu because we want to try different type of food, also i think students are bored to ate the same food every day and some time students those snt'

want to ate at school, they bring their own food because the school provide same menu every day we dont see any change for long time thats will be my reason we want to see a new lunch menu for the school.

Then after they change the menu all the student will see all the change and they start to comment about how is the menu, of course it will a percent of students they will be not agree about the food, thats why i recommend the principal will do a session for student to start to vote what kind of food they want in their menu",0
"This decreased interest in learning can affect a student's motivation levels in all classes. Therefore, when mandating classes such as art, music, or drama for all students, their overall grades, attendance, and motivation levels can suffer.. 
After research into the subject, it has become clear that requiring students to take classes such as art, music, or drama can have multiple drawbacks. Similarly, when a student is required to take a class they are not passionate about, their enthusiasm decreases and they become less interested in learning in general. Firstly, students may feel unmotivated or uninspired by the subject matter, leading them to skip classes, resulting in lower overall attendance and grades",1
"A students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early is a bad idea, maybe have a lot of problem after they are finish high school for three years.

However, finish high school in three years is a good thing to think about it, students will move faraway and move on their life, but that are a small group of students who are thinking one way of their life after three years high school, but the other group of students are have a problem after they finish high school and they need help to resolve the problem they are in. For the students who are have problem need help to resolve, they problem are they making more decision that let they think about can the students do it or can the students sure about this decision or that decision, because is a big decision to change one person life and it happen to every students even the greatest student.

Three years students don't have enough time to think more about their future and not 100% sure about they really are in future, have a lot of students who are finish three years high school and have a good jobs or have a good place to live, not everyone the same life so some students before finish three years of high shool know what they are doing and after high school they making other decision. Four years students they are more ready for the decision and they are have more time to think about what and where they will be in their future, and they got all help from teacher and parent to help that think in mind steady.

Students are mostly don't finish high school three years they have less experiment about college then students who are three years high school, however the three years high school students have more problem then a four years high school students, three years high school students maybe on the time they thinking what they doing next if they can't make it or they are changes they carrer they end up stay with their parent forever into they know what to do next and on the time they off school the those student going to forget everything that they had learn in school and end up failing.

My opinions is every students need more time to think about their carrer in future, before step forward into their life they needs more time to think and do whatever they need in every class and think for their carrer.",0

"     . People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life",0
"One proposal that is gaining traction is for schools to extend their day two hours, while shortening the school week to four days. Finally, students—particularly older students—may find it difficult to adjust to longer days. 
The push to conserve resources and energy is well underway across many different institutions, from businesses to schools. This is because the school building can be kept at a more stable temperature for longer periods of time while still opening and closing fewer days, and energy-intensive operations like air conditioning and lighting can be used less frequently and for shorter periods of time. Schools are particularly well suited to implement changes in practice that can significantly reduce energy usage, as many have already done through green renovations and adopting more sustainable practices. 

However, this proposal also comes with some drawbacks. 

Ultimately, any proposed change in school policies should be evaluated carefully, and the potential advantages and disadvantages for energy and resource conservation should be taken into account. This can also lead to cost savings for the school while being better for the environment overall. 

On the plus side, extending the school day by two hours, coupled with a four-day work week, can certainly help to conserve resources and energy. This idea has both its benefits and drawbacks, and they should be carefully weighed before any policy is enacted. Additionally, while the four-day work week may offer more flexibility for teachers, it could create more stress for staff and administrators, who would have to fit more work into a shorter amount of time. For one, the extended school day would necessitate an extension of the school year, resulting in higher costs for the school in providing more instruction and greater disruption of winter and summer breaks. It is important to consider the various impacts of the extended school day and four-day work week proposal before any decisions are made.",1
"Students with a negative attitude have difficulties to connect with the class and work in a group. In my position i agree with the statement, because; people get better communication with others, get more jobs, and students have more opportunities.

Some people think attitude reflect self confidence to society, as positive attitude reflect peace and happiness. For example: When i have a positive atittude; i see more people want to know about me , but when i have a bad attitude nobody want to know me, because they know people with a positive attitude reflect more friendly, furthermore people with positive attitude have better relation with their family, friends and communitie as they energy is more pleasant.

A positive person with good attitude get more jobs. A student attitude is important because help them to get a better school opportunities. for example: I am waitress and my boss say all the time "" if you want to be a good customer service you need to have a good attitude"" and thats true because when i have a good attitude with the costumers they give me a good tips, but when i have a bad attitude i get bad tips. A position of the body or manner of carrying oneself. In some companies a positive attitude is a requirement for the employer. Customers want a good service, employer want to make good money and companies want a good workers.

Some Schools want students with positive attitude. For example: Sports, Science, and others Team's in schools; the good attitude is a requirement if you want to be part of them. Do yo prefer a person whit bad attitude or good attitude?, think about it. A positive attitude is the key to success in life. However, students with a good attitude facility they own work, and the teachers work, because if a student have a bad attitude is more difficult that teacher or coach teach them and help as student is good in those things, but have a bad attitude he/she loss the opportunitie to show their capacities.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is the key to success in life, as important and help to people get more opportunities at jobs furthermore be great in studies and get a better communication with all people, that make a success person in their life.. People who have a positive attitude do better works",0

I think the acted of kindness can effect someone i guess does effect some one it depends on who they are how they feel ,their story kindness is something we should all do be kind to other",0
"Furthermore, the effectiveness of group work in terms of learning has been demonstrated to be higher when compared to learning on an individual basis. It also encourages the development of communication and language skills, as it provides an often fun environment to practice the use of language in different contexts. On the other hand, one of the disadvantages of working with a group is that it can be time consuming and can lead to teamwork issues if proper guidelines are not followed.. One major benefit is the exchange of cultural knowledge between group members. Working with a group also provides support to each group member, as individuals learn from each other and share experiences. 
When it comes to working with a group, there are several benefits. Working in a group encourages people to learn from each other and to share both their commonalities and differences",1
"Employers value people who have a positive attitude as they are more likely to have better communication skills, open to new ideas and cope better with stress. It is also important to respond to events in an appropriate negative attitude when needed, so as to set healthy boundaries and foster mutual respect.

In conclusion, attitude is an important charisma for success in life as it impacts our actions, outlook, and decisions. It can be seen in the workplace, school, and at home, and is key in creating a safe and positive atmosphere for those around us. People in the workplace with a negative attitude can affect morale, job performance and overall company culture. As such, cultivating a positive attitude is essential to personal and professional success in life.. Attitude is an important charisma as it shapes our actions, outlook and decisions, which consequently affects how our peers and the world around us perceive us. Positive attitudes create an atmosphere of trust, understanding and support. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for succeeding in life. 

School is another area in life where attitude is particularly important, as it can determine how successful a student is. Students with a positive attitude are more likely to be self-confident, organized and motivated individuals, which can be key in helping them reach their goals. Students that are motivated and engaged in activities not only get better grades but also build strong relationships with their teachers, mentors, and peers.

At home, attitude is also important for maintaining relationships with family and friends. 

In the workplace, attitude is key in order to create and maintain successful professional relationships",1
"Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they haven't discovered what life is like. The only way that you could decide what career you want being a early age it's with help of God.. Is not a easy thing to do, decision the most difficult thing to do in life and even more when your young.

Trying to know what a person want at young age it must be difficult, everybody pretend that you must know what you want at young age when you always have get everything by your parents, grand parents, aunt, uncle or tutor.

You can't know what you want to do in your life even if you haven't live by your self.

I don't think it's a good idea for students to star stressing them just when they have enter to school because school can be hard some times even if it's your first year at high school even if you are smart, so I don't think that could work making a student stressing at young age. Big Responsibility Young Age

In most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. What is the best? We'll figure out. And I could do better at school because I didn't have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time.

In conclusion if a student it's a really young age let them think what they want not only because it's at young age it's also because they going to pick something that it's for the rest of their life. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I

want to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present.

It's hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you don't know what career you want to take it's fine you have 4 years to decide",0
"With so many different places to bike, it can be difficult to decide where to explore. Additionally, check the weather before leaving and make sure to bring the necessary protective clothing and sunscreen. Bringing along food, drinks, and snacks is essential for keeping energy levels up on long rides; it can also be useful to bring along friends and family to enjoy the experience together. 

Biking during the summer is an excellent way to enjoy the outdoors and take advantage of the warm weather. Exploring new places around town or simply taking a leisurely ride to spend time with friends and family can provide an excellent way to make the most of summertime. With the right supplies and the right routines, biking can offer a wonderful exclamation on the summer season.. However, there are many places to bike that provide a variety of activities, while still taking advantage of the warm weather - from exploring the wide open countryside to discovering tourist attractions.

When it comes to activities to do while biking, there are countless possibilities. Whether you are interested in sightseeing, shopping, or trying local cuisine, bike riding can offer an enjoyable experience.

To make biking even more enjoyable, there are a few things to keep in mind. Biking can be a great way to get to a variety of places quickly and enjoy the scenery along the way.

"Do you ever wonder if most students use their phones in school for educational purposes? In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages.

Most teachers don't allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyone's going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldn't be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and that's why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.. When listening to music when you're working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then don't know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board.

Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school it'll be easier for them to call you.

Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldn't have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed",0
"Instead of giving up, I decided to start studying more consistently, look for support and guidance from professors, and build strong relationships with a close group of friends. It is not the destination that should be focused on, but rather the journey to get there. 

I recall my freshman year of college when I was struggling academically due to personal issues and other challenges. Churchill's wise words still echo in my head and motivate me every day. It was not an easy or quick fix, but the courage I had to continue on changed my path towards success. 

I eventually got back on track and was able to perform better in my academics. The true test of individual character is the courage to keep going in the face of challenging circumstances. Whether it's with my academic goals or personal goals, I always remind myself that success isn't final and failure isn't fatal, and that it is the courage to continue that really counts.. It felt like giving up was the only option, but I knew deep down that I had to push through it and be courageous in order to reach my goals. According to Churchill, success and failure are temporary states. 
When discussing the consequences of success and failure, Winston Churchill's quote serves as an inspirational reminder that persistence is the key in achieving success",1
"He took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. If students get the chance to learn about what they like they should take advantage of it. Find out who they are.

A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. I also have two careers in mind. They tend to think that is useless just because they don't have the program they are insterested in. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. Sometimes is really hard to get this opportunities. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. While others grow with the same mentality. Midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they don't want to learn new things. For some students this is a big privilege. They all should have a second plan in case plan A is not working so well. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. This is why I should get the opportunity to go. They might learn things that interested them. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits.

Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. It might be better than it looks.

Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. Although some students think this opportunities are useless, actually it opens a lot of doors at a young age to learn about the things they like. They have to hope the best and get ready for the worst.

Some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. I know if one of them fails me I still have the other one. If in any case there was not what I am interested in then I will try new things.. Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. I truly want to know if the careers I have in mind are what I want to do the rest of my life. It does not only happens when they are little",0
"If you know what your future career is talk with your counsolor they can help you figure out what classes are best for you. In high school there are many classes that could help you with your future career.

If the student talks with their counsolor they can figure out what classes the student can take that is helpful for their future career. Talking with my counselor helped me figure out what classes I can take to help me with my career. Knowing what your future career is in high school is very important. I wouldn't be in the place I'm in right now if I didn't know what I wanted my future career to be while in high school. . Taking that class helped me a lot ; for example, Mercedes Benz ranked me 3rd meaning I could go work for them. The student can get a head start on their carrer and by the time they graduate they know what to do. when it's time for collage they already know somewhat about their career.

Take advantage of the classes high school has to offer becasue in the future when your no longer in high school you'd have to pay for those classes.

"Education is also super important because it is through out life. It will also help students be better prepared and it could let them lead to success. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. So it could benefits some student to make them more successful.. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test.

First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Some students could have a better job opportunity if they get an extra 30 minutes because they get more education are more likely to pass their test.

Third, students will be better prepared for test. Another thing a better job could make the students get more money from higher paying job and also some students could want to become a teacher. Some students would not like the job they get. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important.

Second, students could have better job opportunity. Also some students struggle with some subjects so it could also befits some students who can not stay back. So I think an extra 30 minutes could help students get a little more education and it could help students learn more and be better prepared for test. So I feel like an extra 30 minutes is not that long so some student would also not mine. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities. Befits For An Extra Hour of School

85% of students who study more can pass more test. An some student may struggle and that could help student do more activities and maybe they can pass more.

In conclusion, I think an extra 30 minutes could hep students get more education. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. I feel like some students could befits from an extra half an hour of school because it could help students learn more. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. It is also good for some student. Also some students who want to get in a good collage but do not have the money for it if they have a good education they can get in for free but they have to have good grades",0
"For some, especially teenagers, these websites work as entertaining platforms, useful to share memories and talk with friends and new people. For instance, kidnap and monetary robbery are the most popular cases that come out of social media.

In addition, social wesites and items like phones can be utilized in the way. There have been lately a lot of users claiming that their phones are listening at all moment, a tactic which could be useful to spy on people. To develop social skills at a young age is very important for kids to succeed in the future. Posting personal information, such as your adress, cellphone, or location, is an irresponsible action which could lead to unsafe situations. . Enforcing limitations on the use of technology not only will create a stronger relationship between them and the children but it will be beneficial for the kid's future.

After all, technology has become a advantage for many of us in our daily life. Video games, for instance, have become the addiction of many kids, who stop performing their typical responsibilities in order to play with these. The main target is the youth, which is more exposed to technologycal advanced nowadays.

When we think about technology, social media comes related too. The main purpose of most technological items is to make our lives easier and, in some cases like hardwork larbor, it can be very efficient. This is another way human contact is reduced, which will have a significant impact in their future lives. However, it's important to stay aware about its risks and exercise a responsible behavior when using it. Cellphones, smart watches, and more make information very accesible and easy to find. As this theory has not been confirmed yet, it could be easily enforced by anyone with the required knowledge.

Productivity is another factor influenced by technology. Technology had been a useful tool for the man to make his life easier. But when people start spending hours with these objects, the development of dependency towards technology could increase. While these can make contact easier, the risks become higher when social media is not used properly. It's true that many factors affect the achievement of succeess and it can not be predicted by the skills a person has; but what it's true is that we are always going to be exposed to social interactions and it's neccessary to learn how to manage them.

A solution for this problem could be in the parents' hands. Moreover, we shouldn't let it take total control of our actions and enjoy in-person relations more. But technology also has a negative impact on social relations, as it reduces human contact and promotes lazyness. Websites like Facebook and Instagram make identity theft easier: as they reduce human contact, people can take advantage of the users by introducing themselves first as a 'new friend,' to then execute their real intentions",0
"Instead of feeling discouraged and giving up, embracing these challenges and failure-driven learning experiences can help one to reach their goals and elevate their personal growth.. It is important to remain positive and motivated when life throws us challenges and to use experiences of failure as learning opportunities to make us better and closer to achieving our goals. Unfortunately, I failed to get the desired score in one test and felt like I let myself down. 

For example, when I was in school, I put a lot of pressure on myself to get the best grades possible and be the valedictorian of my class. I was determined to prove that I could do better and eventually I surpassed all expectations and graduated at the top of my class. This painful experience pushed me to work harder and turn my disappointment into motivation. 
Failure is an essential part of the learning process as it helps us grow more resilient and empowered. This experience taught me to stay positive and use failures as a motivation to persevere. 

Whatever challenges we face in life, there’s always valuable lessons to be learnt from our mistakes or failures",1
"Secondly, each students can make one question about what they are doing. Dear Teachers,

Date: 03/12/19

Address:

Center St Generic_City

In my opinion working in group should be more benefits.

Teacher should let student work in group.

Teacher should be allow students to work in group. Also, in some schooler teacher let student to work in group because some students don't feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. It would benefits to get more information about what topic they will do it.

Firstly, you can look more than one idea. Each of every students can catch a mistake. Some activities should be necessary to do in group.

For example, when they are doing a project. However, most of the classses have workshit to do in group.

For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class.

Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone.

Sometimes, teacher don't like to put student in group becasue they observe that when student are in group they just talk about anothers thnig not about what they tell you , but not all the students like that.

In conclusion,

for these reasons is more benefits to work and group than work alone.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name. There are three reason why should they let student work in group:

Working in group think more stronger and faster. Thirdly, if you work in group you can be more comfortable with your work.

Your working should have the best idea and should not be any mistake because before to give the work to the teacher every students should look at it.

It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they don't it",0
"It could also be difficult on the teachers, who would be expected to teach the courses on top of their current workload and without receiving additional compensation. 
The potential introduction of a rule requiring all high school students to take courses during the summer, evenings, or weekends in order to finish school faster, has a wide range of implications to consider. Furthermore, this rule could have a detrimental effect on the free time of all students, taking away invaluable time they would otherwise spend engaging in hobbies, sports, educational trips, and socializing with their family and friends. For immigrant students, this could be especially challenging, due to cultural, financial, and language barriers they may face. In considering the potential creation of such a rule, it would be wise for decision-makers to weigh these factors carefully.",1
"However knowing that you don feel well and you gave the best of you to others before, that will be a great acomplishment for you and from now on you will be and example and will help othres that feel the same as you to continue and leave that bad mood behing and show the best of them.

In conclusion a good attitude is one of the important things to success in life. I think that every person have the right to be respected not for what they have is just we all need respect. People cannot be treat it bad because of you mood or just because you didn't like how that person is. I believe that a possitive actitude has a good impression in othre persons. I believe that if you are in bad mood and think that everthing is going to bother you is better for you to figured it out as soon as posible on you own, because people can not be involved with your own personal problem and i think even if you are not felling well you also need to be in a good attitude to the people because if you let you bad attitude to ruin the days of other they will think that you're always like that and will be enough to them to think the worse of you.            . Been in a poaitive attitude will appeal the attraction of other persons to you by that will hepl you to success. Because if someone is being rude to them and you act different and start helping them they will notice that you have a good attitude to others that you dont even know. Doesn't matter what you can't act bad with other persons, even if you don't know them and think that you will not see them again but the reality is that in other day you can really need from that person but that person will not be there for you because of how you acted before. The decison you make to be who you are is to realize that other person will act the same way to you as you just did to them.

Everyone need to be respected don't matter the age, country or religion becuase we all are humans. I feel that recieving a bad attitude from a person that you even know is the badest thing that someone can do to you becuase you don't know that person and if you show that reaction from you that means that you're like that with everyone and show that you dont have respect to others. I think that we all are same with some differences than others as religion, country, color, etc... But there around you are person who can influence you to be a bad attitude peson with others. Even in your job is when you need to be the more kind as possible to keep those person that you don't know with you becuase as they need you, you also need them at the same time becuase they will help you to keep that job that you need, also your impression to them has to be best, as you show them at work you also need to show the best of you out of work that will show that you're successeful person in life and that you dont act good just when you need it and that is how you are and they can also trust in you because you are being honest to them.

Considerating that don't matter what you cannot give a bad treat to other person just because you woke up in a bad mood. By the way you cannot judge someone just for their apparience is like judging a book with out reading it, it can be someone who will look with an angry face, a sad face even it can look weird but if you dont start sharing time, knowing each other, know what they like and what they do or how they are you cannot put your bad attitude just for how they look, they can also treat you as the same you did to them

However, people cannot recieve a bad attitude from you as if they were different to you. ",0
"Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.

While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. In conclusion, Students wouldn't be able to do any activies in school.

Students shouldn't be allow to take classes at home while other student's go to school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. I personnel can't stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. Finally, Students wouldn't be able to enjoy the life of a teenager. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. As a result, Do you think it will help student's in the future?. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home.

Students would not be able to socialize with other students. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them.

Students would not be responsible in the future",0
"Furthermore, many students are concerned with the nutrition and safety of the cafeteria food.

To make the school cafeteria more appealing to students, the first step is to improve the quality of the food. The menus should be regularly reviewed and changed to make sure that there is enough variety for the students. 

After conducting research, it is evident that there are several underlying reasons why students don't like school lunch. 
One of the biggest problems that students across America face is not enjoying the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. Additionally, the taste is often an issue, as the cafeteria food is usually not very flavorful and for many students, it is not enjoyable to eat. Further, schools should also introduce alternative options such as healthier protein bars and smoothies. Many students become unenthused with the same meals, and it affects their performance in school. Schools should also invest in hiring experienced chefs to provide meals that are both nutritious and tasty. Firstly, the quality and the presentation of the food are often subpar; moreover, many school cafeterias lack variety and offer the same selections of meals every day, causing students to develop an aversion to the food. Additionally, schools should focus on improving the presentation of the food, as this may make them more attractive and more appetizing to students. Finally, parents should be actively involved in the choices being made, as their input is necessary to make the school cafeteria more appetizing and appealing to students.",1
"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life.

Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but it's the complete opposite. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someone's help. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision. I remember when I decided to break my friend's trophies. Meaning that, it's most likely for you to have a positive mind.                                 . Sometimes it's better to make the right choices because it releases our stress.

Having a successful life is what everyone wants. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. That's the time to express your feeling to someone else. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you don't want to end up one day behind bars.

Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. It can help you in many ways. I was so mad that I wasn't thinking right. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. For example, when you're angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasn't right. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life.

Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal",0
"Obviously one should always be positive if they want a desirable outcome in life because life is too short to be unsuccessful and negative. Working for the president of the United States is a more beneficial job then working a regular nine to five. This kind of posture can benefit ones future.

If more individuals convey a positive attitude many would have better employment opportunities. With most success theres always positive results. Job opportunities and getting notice by important people are opportunities that come with having an affirmative attitude. Putting yourself first in everything you do can lead to success.

Showing an affirmative attitude can help you work for the president and can also help you have a better income which can lead to success. This attitude can lead one to have job opportunities.

Looking at the other side being negative can also help you be successful in life. Employment opportunities and getting noticed by important individuals can bring success. One example is by being selfish. With this negative image shows that your the most important person that can only bring you a favorable outcome.

As many have stated displaying confidence is the way to go in life. One way is by having a confident posture. Having a good occupation is important.

Since it's important to have a positive image it can expand the people you meet",0
"No great achievement was ever accomplished without the application of knowledge. 

Take, for instance, the impact of the printing press on the expansion of knowledge in Europe. Many of the greatest minds throughout history have proven this to be true, especially in the modern world. Before its invention in 1440, Europeans had to rely on handwritten texts, limiting the spread of knowledge. This is just one example of how knowledge has been used to bring progress to our world.

In contrast, imagination does have its benefits. Yet, without a basis of knowledge, these ideas can remain just as stagnant as a wild thought. With knowledge, people are able to confirm theories and construct pathways to progress. While it has the potential to spark innovation, imagination alone cannot lead to certainty or progress without the application of knowledge. It can act as a catalyst for creativity and exploration. 
Knowledge is an undeniable key to success. Therefore, it is clear that knowledge is more valuable than imagination alone.. However, Gutenberg’s invention of printing technology revolutionized the way knowledge is distributed, enabling Europeans to access and record knowledge more quickly and accurately. It has the capacity to provide fresh ideas and break the status quo. It is the monument which plans and ideas are built on. On the other hand, imagination has its limitations. 

Ultimately, knowledge is essential for turning imaginative dreams into reality",1

"when you have a problem you need to try your best, try not to give up, and try not to get confuse or it will be even harder for you.. There was no way that I can remember to bass the ball. If the other team has it I attack to get the ball but when I get it on my feet I cant pass because its hard. Sometimes I gave up because I forget to pass the ball. I agree with this statement because when you in a problem you give up, you dont know what to do, and you try your best to find out why its hard or why its a problem.

when I play soccer there was one problem, I never passed the ball to my teammates. I search up ""why do I never pass the ball and how can I get better to pass or not forget to pass the ball."" It helped me a lot and now I started trying my best to get better at soccer and its going good so far. The only thing I can do is go in Google or YouTube so it can help me. The coach always tells me in every game to pass the ball.

I dont know what to do to remember to pass the ball. Sometimes I don't know what to do to get better, its hard watching YouTube or going to Google is the only thing I can do to get batter, or not forget to pass, and help me.

"These individuals had to overcome challenges such as fear of failure and lack of resources.

The essential qualities one must have to become successful include dedication, discipline, resilience, resourcefulness, self-confidence, and a willingness to learn. Education provides individuals with the skills and knowledge to confidently pursue their ambitions, as well as access to a supportive network and resources to help them on their journey. These qualities enable them to make the most of the resources available to them and to persevere in the face of difficulty.

Furthermore, the successful people often had certain advantages that helped them on their path to success. These included access to networks of influential people, resources to help finance their dreams, and an education that provided them with knowledge and skills essential to achieving their goals.

The importance of education in achieving one's goals cannot be overstated. All of these make a profound difference in the ability of the individual to reach their goals.. 
After researching several successful people who have achieved their goals despite the hardships they faced, some of the strategies they utilized included resilience, hard work, and a positive attitude",1
"                        . What i'm trying to say is takeing a risk is not always bat every thing happens for a reson at lest that is what my parants said. one of the book was called Nialarmstrong it talked about the life of Nialarmstrong and the other was called Dog Man it talked about a dog that some how got transformed in to a human offecer cinda like capton americ exapet hes not a super solder. taking big riskes is a part of our lives every human being took a risk at lest ones in there lives sometimes you would not evan know that you took that risk but in realty you did for example im take a risk typing this ovesly the conscances are not that big but they still mater in life.

My oppenion is to watch out, becareful, and take the risk like I sad riskes dont alway tearn out bad. Taking more then one persons oppenion is a good way to make your final call for example, ther was one time where I wanted two differant books but I only had eangh for one. That is what all of the succesful peaple do inclouding the prastent, besniss men, loyers becoase if the make the wrong call they could posibly face some vary big concaconses and if you want to be succeful you will have to be vary careful and take as many oppenions as posoble.

Taking peoples oppeinons could be risky at times but a good tip is to take that risk. if you do lesson to every thing I said in this your oppenions to others would change a lot and what i mean by that is you will look at many thing in a differant precpactive, your disagon makeing would change lats say you take six peaples oppenions three of them said there favert coler was blue and the other three said green now this is when a risk comes in now you are going to chose a coler lats say you chose blue now the numbers have changed 4 blue and 3 green so blue won. these thing is are in you every day life so you have to becarful,take risks,and take other oppenions. I did not stop there I wanted anther oppenion so then I want and asked the libarn oppenion she told me "" the nailarmstrong book sounds better to me but your choose to pick out the book that standes out the most to you"" so then i took her edvide and the book that stoude out the most to me was Nailarmstrong. Its always fun learning about other peoples storys and what they did to get to where they are. and let me tell you I had a lot of fun reading that book. I had to make a good disagon becouse if I did not then it would have been a wast of $15. I evan told my frinds about it and they where like ""can I chick it out"" if i sed no i would sound disrspactful so I said sure ill bring it tomorrow in lunch.

Taking more then one oppenion might be time consuming but trust me it will help you make a 90% better choose then if you would just run in blind and start makeing bad chooses. My conclogon is paople should take more then one oppeinon.

I dicided to take my frends Generic_Name oppenion he told me to "" take Dog man it is so cool "" but i feelt like there was something about the Nailarmstrong book",0
"With trials and tribulations, and a belief in oneself, success can be achieved.. It is through failure that an individual can discover what works and matters, and have the determination to move forward despite not having the outcome they had initially planned for. 

The truth of Churchill’s quote is that success is not always guaranteed, and failure is a natural part of the process. 

The success of an individual is not only determined by the number of successes they accumulate, but also by their willingness to try new opportunities even after failure. 
When it comes to seeking success, it is often assumed that the journey itself is what will ultimately determine if an individual is successful or not. Ultimately, these personal successes can lead to even higher achievements, and a greater chance of the individual reaching their goals. No one starts out knowing how to achieve success; instead, they learn from their mistakes and use them to drive future decisions. Winston Churchill’s quote, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,” conveys the idea that an individual’s enthusiasm and perseverance will be what helps them learn from failure and succeed.

The idea that failure can be an aid in the pursuit of success is one based on the notion of an individual using their failures to fuel further growth and success. The process of learning from failure can be a long and difficult one, but the fact that the individual is pushing past rejection and disappointment to continue to work towards success should be recognized. Rather than giving up when faced with rejections and defeats, an individual should focus on trusting the process and using every obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow",1
"Thomas Jefferson wrote to never to be idle and he believes that is better to always be doing something, because if you do not try to do things you never will get a purpose in life, even though some says that inactivity also serve a purpose. I have never been idle in life, because i always do my responsibilities and i try to not be lazy, some times i also help other peoples cause we need to be good with others no matters how they are with us. I always like to do my own work because i want to be some one in the future that's why i like to do some effort in life. I never want to be a idle person.

In conclusion, is wonderful how we have done in life because life is so hard for everyone but, always we can do some effort to be proud of our self.

Although Thomas Jefferson believes that is always better be doing something that doing nothing, because if you do not try to do things in life you will never get a purpose, actually Thomas Jefferson says that if inactivity also serve a purpose, in my opinion people do not like to do things because they do not want to be someone in life and they are lazy. Do things make you do better in life, also is better to have the mind busy in something, if you do things you can be someone in life.

Although Thomas Jefferson believes that is always better be doing something that doing nothing, because if you do not try to do things in life you will never get a purpose, actually Thomas Jefferson says that if inactivity also serve a purpose, in my opinion people do not like to do things because they do not want to be someone in life and they are lazy.

Although Thomas Jefferson believes that is always better be doing something that be doing nothing, because if you do not try to do something in life you will never get a purpose, people just like to be annoying with others, people try to do hard life for the others people.

Although Thomas Jefferson says if inactivity also serve a purpose in life, in my opinion, when you do not do anything you will never get a result of good things always we have to try to do some effort to be someone in life.

In addition, According to the prompt and ""determine never to be a idle"". Everyone makes errors in life but, always we will try to fixed no matters how big they are, some day i want to my fathers be proud of my work in life.  ",0
"Remind readers that a success story is more than just endings and that the path to success is likely to be filled with setbacks. A student is struggling to pass a difficult college course and has already failed the course four times. His famous quote, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”, emphasizes the importance of not giving up in the face of difficulty, instead persevering and striving for success.

To understand better how to continue striving in the face of repeated failure, let’s examine a hypothetical scenario. 
Sir Winston Churchill remains a powerful example of perseverance and success despite failure. 

To support not losing enthusiasm after failure, an essay should emphasize that life is full of challenges and how failure is inextricably linked to success. But that student must remember Churchill’s advice and take courage in the knowledge that failure can lead to success if it is met with dedication and consistency. Point out the detrimental mental, emotional, and physical effects of allowing the persistence of failure to cause someone to give up. However, his successes as a politician did not come easy. Despite experiencing a multitude of failures early in his life, he refused to give in and kept pushing himself forward, ultimately becoming one of Britain's most legendary figures. 

On a personal or professional level, it is important to remain consistent and not give up after failure. Through researching the achievements of Winston Churchill and exploring a hypothetical scenario, it has become clear that the courage to continue despite failure is the only way to experience lasting success.. It would be easy for the student to become disheartened and give up, especially with the overwhelming challenge of preparing for and taking yet another exam. Finally, encourage readers that re-centering and recalibrating after failure is a normal part of life and essential for anyone seeking to reach their goals. Churchill was a British statesman most famously known for his leadership during WW2",1

Finally, I asked my friends what their college plans were. I was really interested in college, but I wasn't sure where to start. He also said that I should check in with my counselor about what colleges would be best for me based on my strengths and weaknesses.

I then called my parents to ask them about the finances. 
I was on the phone with my brother, trying to figure out what I should do after high school. They talked to me about how much money was available for college tuition and gave me some valuable tips on how I can save money. I asked him what he did after high school, and he explained the importance of having a general understanding of my financial and academic resources. Most of them are planning on attending college in some shape or form, and it was really helpful to hear their stories about the different steps they took to get accepted.",1

Overall, after school homework clubs are immensely beneficial for both students and their surrounding schools. Eagerness to learn can spread to their peers, creating a stronger learning environment in the school. In addition, after school homework clubs may lead to an increase in parental engagement in the student's learning. Additionally, after school homework clubs encourage collaboration and problem-solving skills in a supervised environment, enhancing students' social and teamwork abilities. This gives the students a sense of trust and belonging, making them more likely to have a positive outlook towards education. 
Numerous studies have shown that after school homework clubs are beneficial for both students and their surrounding schools. By having access to a tutor or mentor, students are given the chance to receive individual support outside of the classroom. Learning in this manner can help students gain confidence and think more deeply about the material they are studying. This can lead to improved grades and a better understanding of the material. With access to school-provided lessons and resources, parents can more easily follow their child's progress and assist them when needed. 

For the students, homework clubs offer a tailored learning experience designed to help them enhance their academic skills and potential. With the tailored learning experience, students have a chance to improve their study habits while the school increases parental engagement. These clubs provide a safe and secure environment for students to complete their school work and develop their study habits. This can lead to successful academic outcomes and improved grades.. 

Homework clubs also provide further benefits for the school as a whole. By providing this service, schools demonstrate to their students that they are invested in their future and want to see everyone succeed",1
"You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities.

Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. Witches end up shutting your schools programs and closing the school and there wouldnt be any jobs for teachers or you to find quickly enough to pay bills and rent witch wouldnt be so good for the employees.. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. I understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn.

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students",0
"An individual who fails to take being responsible and hard working in a job seriously may face the consequences of not following rules, which can lead to disciplinary action and even job termination. A young employee who researches successful people and works hard to achieve their goals improves their chances of leaving an excellent record at their job. 
The importance of being a responsible and hard-working employee cannot be overstated. Ultimately, it is worth working hard and being responsible in any job because it builds character and provides a greater sense of satisfaction and fulfillment.. Additionally, taking on challenging tasks and being reliable can create a reputation that will open doors for future job opportunities and promotions. This is of particular value because excellent records can be the difference between getting a job and being overlooked",1
"I'll disagree because being success is really important and being a failure is one of the worst thing that can happened in life because when someone start failing their is no more reasons to keep doing the stuff that someone like in if when the person start failing for their success they cannot do like that much for they can help for that and when the success person is their best time they can do all the stuffs they want for they can keep being success and keep their position and in good conditions.

Being success the hold time can make someone to fail at the end because someone keep doing their same thing all the time and when that happened the people can start getting tier and that's hew can people can make their success carriers or jobs to fail and that's how they can prevent from all does things that can prevent them from failing and when the people doesn't see they can start to fail they don't pain attention or they don;t care about what they doing during that time,

When a person is a failure at the beganing they can get more courage and start working harder for they can be a great the success person in life after being a failure in life for a long time they can start being success from one time into the other that how the great brains can work after being a such a failure person they can be a great success person in life after being a failure and start working harder and start being a great competent person for working in that areas.

In Addition all this problems can help you to have a good character a better attitude because is necessary for talk with other because we need to have a way a formed how to talk without breaking they feelings because as humans the we are we feel sad went other trade us with a mad face and sometimes we performed don't talk to then.

"Musical instruments such as the harp and the flute can often be found in art classes, as well as popular plays like ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""The Comedy of Errors"". Famous expressionists such as Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo have helped to promote the importance of art for generations. 
Learning art is a valuable and enriching experience that can be enjoyed by all ages. This is far more beneficial to having a required class, where the content may not be viewed as exciting or engaging by the student, resulting in a lack of interest and in worse case scenarios, failure. 

Taking an elective course provides a much more beneficial experience when compared to a required class. Electives allow students to choose classes that offer more interests and learning opportunities that are not necessarily offered in the required classes. It provides an opportunity for students to find classes that are engaging and stimulating for them, which can lead to more involved learning. 

Additionally, allowing students to choose their own electives gives them a level of autonomy, helping to foster independence and creativity. This allows them to explore different activities that they may not normally seek out, encouraging them to develop new skills and gain knowledge outside of their traditionally structured courses. . Throughout history, different types of art classes have emerged, including painting, woodworking, music, drama, and even dance",1
"Ultimately, there is no easy answer, and it should be approached differently depending on the specific situation.. However, many argue that the effectiveness of distance learning is limited compared to the traditional in-person classroom setting, making it a controversial topic. To help students in difficult circumstances, one solution is to offer distance learning opportunities, which allows students to stay on track without having to attend in person. 
Although there are plentiful excuses for students not to attend school, including illness, family trips, or lack of interest, natural disasters and other issues in the student's neighborhood can also make it difficult for them to attend. The impact of absences and making up an entire year of schooling can be significantly detrimental to a student's academic success",1
"I have a passion for creating and developing engaging content, with an emphasis on storytelling and bringing personality to each piece. I believe this enthusiastic approach is necessary for success in any production team. 

I have also developed a keen eye for detail and ensuring accuracy in all aspects of production. I have worked with some of the top production companies in the country, leading award-winning projects both independently and collaboratively. I am confident that I could exceed expectations by using my experience and passion to create unique, engaging content.. 

In addition to my experience and qualifications, I bring a tremendous level of enthusiasm and commitment to every project. I am passionate about the work I do and strive to make it the best it can be. 
I am incredibly excited for the opportunity to visit the company and learn more about the job. My past successes in TV production prove that passion combined with skill can go a long way. 

I believe that my experience and enthusiasm make me an ideal candidate to visit the company and learn more about the job. With six years of experience in TV production, I have had a number of successes both on and off screen",1
"An extended school day could also create incompatibilities for both students and related individuals, such as parents, guardians, or teachers. The implications of this school schedule include stress on students, an overly-academic curriculum, and limited availability for extracurricular activities. 

The idea of implementing an extended school day is an attractive but often negative prospect, as it could lead to fatigue and decreased enthusiasm for learning, as well as an overall decrease in academic performance. 

Currently, the majority of public and private schools in the United States follow a traditional scholastic structure that follows a set daily schedule, usually lasting from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Additionally, an extended school day could lead to an increase in stress and anxiety for students as they struggle to find balance between their academic and social lives.. Parents, guardians, and teachers would all have to adjust their schedules in order to accommodate a longer school day, which could create a strain due to the need for additional childcare options. 

While an extended school day may come with some potential benefits, such as increased academic opportunities, improved communication outreach and a more flexible curricular structure, there are potential problems associated with it that must be considered",1
"After graduating college, I decided to take a risk and move to a new city, despite having no job prospects there. 
Making decisions can be challenging, and many of us struggle to decide the right path to take. With each member in the group bringing a unique perspective and expertise, we were able to come up with a unique and creative solution to the project that none of us would have thought of alone. Doing the same thing over and over does not allow you to reach new heights and experience different things. Taking multiple opinions into account and having the courage to take a leap of faith will help you become more confident in your decisions and achieve things you never thought were possible.. Although it was a bit of a roller coaster, I quickly learned about the city and grew an appreciation for it while meeting amazing people and making lifelong connections.

It is these risks that are often the biggest rewards. However, it is important to remember that no matter how certain you might be that your opinion is right, one person's opinion is rarely enough to reach a successful resolution. Without having all of us involved and working together, the project would have been much less successful.

In addition, it is just as important to take risks. Taking the input of more than one person and considering multiple angles is an essential part of the decision-making process.

This was something I realized during my sophomore year in college when my professor assigned us a group project",1
"It gives us strength and helps us remain focused on the big picture even when faced with adversity and setbacks.

One example of having a positive attitude leading to success is Bill Samuels Jr. Having a healthy attitude helps us to make more meaningful connections in our personal and professional lives. 
We all know how important it is to have a positive outlook on life. After initial failure from whiskey-making, he didn’t give up. It helps us to break down obstacles, to stay motivated to reach our goals, and to trust in ourselves and our journey. 

It is no surprise that having a positive attitude can help us to tackle many of life’s tricky situations, from job interviews, to managing relationships, to simply navigating through life. A positive attitude has the power to encourage us through the difficult times, to obtain better results, and to achieve our goals. Having the right attitude is key to making great connections in life and increasing our chances of success.. It eventually led to his family's creation of Maker’s Mark, one of America’s most popular brands of whiskey.

No matter how hard life may seem at times, having a positive attitude and believing in yourself can make all the difference. He believed in himself and his skills, and was able to persistently work on a new recipe he initially believed had no chance of succeeding",1
"On the other hand this would be a big problem for schools.

In first place, I think this will be a big disadvantage for studets who have others responsiblity to do after school. This would affect the students attendence which, also will affect their grades. For example, I have a job after school and I need to be there at four oclock, but if my school follow this model I wouldn't keep my job, because school will finish two ahours late and it will be very late for me to go to work. I Think my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours, because two more hours of school will be very streful for students and students will not have the enought time to do their homeworks after school. I do not agree, with this model by extending the school day two hours. To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours.  . Students will be very streful and tired during class. With this in mind, students, also will be affecting with their grades, for the reason that they will not turn in their homeworks.

Some say, if schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours, would be a big problem for students attendance because students will not show up to every single day of school, for the reason that they will be tired from the day before of school. Therefore follow this model would not be a good idea to deal with, because attendance is something very important that schools require to students can pass their school year.

In the final analysis, this rutine will not be easy for students to face, even know that there is going to be only for day of school, for me this still not a good idea to agree with. Also students will not have the enought time to do their homework after school, becuase they will get very late and tired at home and they will not feel like to do their homework, knowing that they need to rest for the next day of school. As a student that I am this would affect me in my daily rutine. This show, that if school follow this model this really will affect me and not only me- but also other students who, also have to work after school.

Second, two more ahurs of school will be very streful for students, because classes will be longers than what they usually are, so students will get tired and they will not concentrate in what the teacher is saying",0
"In order for students to get the most out of group work, teachers should actively facilitate the process. 

Activities that are best suited for group work include ones that require problem-solving, research, debate, or peer-support. It encourages the exchange of ideas between classmates, and provides an opportunity for them to collaborate and combine resources. For example, class members could work together to design a marketing campaign for a new product, present their perspectives on a case study, or choose a topic for a group research paper. Group work also helps to foster and develop students’ social and communication skills. Teachers should also be sure to assign tasks to individuals within the group as this helps provide accountability. 

There are three key reasons why teachers should encourage students to work together. 
 Working in a group has many distinct advantages over solo work. They can do this by establishing clear expectations for the project, providing supportive guidance to help keep the group on task, and outlining roles and responsibilities. Finally, group work gives students the opportunity to share their knowledge and learn from one another. First, it allows students to develop vital collaboration and conflict resolution skills which will benefit them when they enter the workplace. As such, it is important that teachers create a supportive environment for group work to thrive.. Second, it can lead to an increase in creative thinking and problem-solving abilities as class members work together to tackle complex tasks. 

Overall, working in a group has the potential to be very beneficial for students. By providing students with the opportunity to work together, teachers can help cultivate important skills that can be applied to the classroom and beyond",1

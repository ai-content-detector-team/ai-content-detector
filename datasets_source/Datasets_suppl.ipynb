       "3                           Healthy eating habits are especially important for teenagers, as their bodies and minds are still growing and developing. A balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats provides the essential nutrients needed for energy, focus, and overall health. Teens should aim to eat regular meals and snacks to maintain stable blood sugar levels and avoid skipping meals, which can lead to overeating later. Staying hydrated with water instead of sugary drinks is also key. Learning to listen to hunger cues, practicing portion control, and limiting processed foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats can help establish positive habits that last into adulthood.

       "      <td>This paper proposes a single-bit consensus with ability to converge in finite-time. The main feature of this consensus protocol is the single-bit information update. The consensus protocol is proposed based on the sign of difference between state values. This implies that only single-bit of information (the sign) is required to update the state of the agents. This reduces the amount of processing/computation load and/or network communication load at each agent. It should be emphasized that in applications with real-time data processing where the computation and communication are required in faster time scale, the less computation and/or communication load is a significant merit. Since the protocol is nonlinear, a new Lyapunov function is proposed to prove consensus stability. Further, it is proved that for the proposed single-bit consensus protocol the Lyapunov function vanishes in finite-time, implying the finite-time convergence of the consensus protocol. In [4]–[6] finite-time consensus protocols are proposed, however these protocols impose large amount of computation on agents and are computationally less efficient than the proposed single-bit protocol in this paper.\\nQuantized consensus [12], [26], [27] is a related concept, where the agents reach consensus on quantized information with finite quantization levels for possibly unbounded data. In this direction [27] investigates a deterministic quantization based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In [12] authors adopt a single-bit quantized consensus method for detection based on Bayesian criterion and Neyman-Pearson criterion. In [13] the authors propose two consensus+innovation type distributed detectors based on Generalized Likelihood-Ratio Test (GLRT) for composite hypothesis testing via a group of sensors. Further, communication in multi-agent systems based on single-bit of information is also adopted in distributed detection [28], [29]. In these works a group of sensors are spatially distributed over a surveillance field to locally detect the existence of an uncooperative target and then communicate their single-bit decisions to a fusion center. The single-bit decisions are based on either the hybrid combination of GLRT and Bayesian estimation [29] or Generalized-Rao Test [28]. The fusion center combines the received information based on the fusion rules and makes a global decision.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) the proposed protocol is based on single-bit of information, which makes it practical in real-time system applications. This is the most important feature of our proposed protocol. (ii) a new Lyapunov function is proposed to prove the stability and convergence of this nonlinear consensus protocol under certain connectivity condition.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Despite great advances in the theory of nonlinear controls, when it comes to practical implementation, PD control laws undisputably continue to be the most popular choice. [33, Table 1A] shows a detailed account on the list of controllers used and their corresponding acceptance ratings. The popularity of this type of control laws arises from its ease of implementation and robustness due to its model independent nature. This popularity has equally pervaded robotic systems. In fact, there are formal guarantees of stability for a broad class of robots that includes manipulators [21,36]. See Table 1, which shows a list of stability results. A more detailed list of these types of control laws and the corresponding stability results are given in [5, Table 1.1].\\nDespite the increase in complexity of the models, PD control laws have dominated even the domain of bipedal robots. Bipedal locomotion is hybrid in nature, with alternating phases of continuous (swinging forward of the nonstance foot) and discrete events (instantaneous impact of the nonstance foot with ground). In addition, unlike the industrial robotic arms, which have a fixed base, bipedal robots are largely underactuated. Fig. 1 shows some examples of bipedal robots that used PD and PD based tracking control laws. It is worth noting that the reference trajectories that were tracked were obtained offline. In fact, the field of locomotion has largely focused on experimental realization by dividing the problem into two parts. First, obtain reference trajectories/gaits in a simulation model by using offline optimization tools [11,31]. Second, play these trajectories in the robot by a low level tracking control law [12,32,40]. Due to uncertainties in the system, model based controllers were generally avoided, thereby giving preference to the more traditional PD based control laws. These control laws are known to be “hassle free”, since they are model-independent and easy to implement. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to explore the stability properties of PD control laws for walking robots, which include varying levels of complexity due to the presence of impacts and underactuations.\\nWe will be establishing stability of PD control laws by the construction of strict Lyapunov functions developed by Arimoto et. al. [2], Koditschek [18], and Bayard and Wen [36] all in the same period of time 1984-1988. Local and global stability results were shown for both stationary and time varying desired configurations [15,19,38], but only for fully actuated systems.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A major challenge in the analysis of temporal networks is that one often has to discretize time by aggregating connections into time windows. Given a discrete or discretized set of interactions, one can then analyze communities, important nodes, and other facets of such networks by examining a multilayer-network representation of these interactions [1], [32], [40], [75]. An important challenge that arises with aggregation is that there may not be any obvious or even any ‘correct’ size of a time window (even when such aggregation employs non-uniform time windows [12], [68], [69], [74]). A window that is too small risks missing important network structures (e.g., by construing a signal as noise), but using an overly large window may obscure important temporal features. (See [18] for one discussion.) Moreover, in many social systems, interactions are bursty [4], [33], [41], which is a crucial consideration when aggregating interactions [31] and is potentially a major cause of concern when using homogeneous time windows [69]. Bursty interactions not only present a challenge when choosing the width of the time windows, but they also challenge where to place the boundaries such windows. Shifting time windows forward or backward may significantly alter the statistics of a data set, even when one does not change the width of the windows [41].\\nFrom a modeling perspective, aggregating interactions often may not be an appropriate approach for systems with asynchronous activity or which evolve continuously in time. See [79] for an investigation of biological contagions, [84] for a study of influential users in social networks, [85], [86] for a generalization of the formalism of ‘activity-driven networks’ to continuous time, [57] for a study of rankings in competitive sports, and [19] for a general continuous-time framework for temporal networks. In many cases, contacts in a temporal network can have a noninstantaneous duration, and it can be important to take such information into account [61], [71]. For example, the phone-call data that were studied in [28] require contacts to exist for the duration of a phone call. In other cases, interactions can be instantaneous (e.g., a mention in a tweet, a text message, and so on), and their importance decreases over time [11], [46]. For many types of temporal networks (e.g., feeds on social media), there is also a decay in attention span for reacting to posts [30], [49], [50].</td>\n",

       "      <td>Image and video upscaling has been studied for decades and remains an active topic of research because of constant technological advances in digital imaging. One scenario where upscaling is now more demanding arises in digital display technologies, where new standards like BT.2020 [1] are introduced. The resolution of digital displays has experienced a tremendous growth over the past few decades, as shown in Figure 1. The transition between different formats leads to a challenging problem. On one hand, large amount of digital content still exist in popular old standards such as standard– definition (SD). On the other hand, the latest display technologies (e.g. 4K, 8K and above) are expected to show this content with reasonable quality. Standard upscaling technologies are clearly insufficient for this purpose. While a 2× upscaler maps 1 input pixel into 4 output pixels, an 8× upscaler maps 1 input pixel into 64 output pixels, which already can contain a small image. The problem demands advanced solutions that are capable of understanding the content and filling in these large pieces of images with visually appealing and consistent information. In particular, large upscaling factors are needed to convert SD to ultra high–definition (UHD) resolutions. Thus, large upscaling represents a real problem in current market and it is expected to persist and become even more challenging with the rapid development of new technologies.\\nIn classical interpolation theory, upscaling images by integer factors is explained as two sequential processes: upsample (insert zeros) and filter [2], [3]. Standard upscaler algorithms, such as Bicubic or Lanczos, find high–resolution images with a narrow frequency content by using fixed low–pass filters. Modern tensor processing frameworks (e.g. Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.) implement this process using a so–called strided transposed convolutional layer. Similarly, the image acquisition process can be modeled as: filter and downsample (drop samples). Many times we know the explicit model, e.g. bicubic downscaler. Tensor processing frameworks implement this process using a strided convolutional layer.\\nMore advanced upscalers have followed geometric principles to improve image quality. For example, edge–directed interpolation uses adaptive filters to improve edge smoothness [4], [5], or bandlet methods use both adaptive upsampling and filtering [6]. Later on, machine learning has been able to use examples of pristine high–resolution images to learn a mapping from low–resolution [7]. The rise of deep–learning and convolutional networks in image classification tasks [8] quickly saw a series of important improvements in image resizing with large upscaling factors, which is the process widely know as image super–resolution (SR).</td>\n",

The failure to forecast the financial crisis recession of the late 2000s is well known. But this is a constant theme in the forecasting record over the past 50 years.\\nFor example, four quarters ahead, the mean prediction of the large number of forecasters reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters has never been for negative growth. In contrast, since 1968 there are 23 examples in the actual data of US real GDP growth being less than zero in a quarter.\\nNyman and Ormerod (op.cit.) show that applying a random forest algorithm to a small set of monetary variables generates four-quarter ahead predictions of real US GDP growth which are much better over the 1990-2017 period than those reported by the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Similar results are obtained for the UK.\\nThe machine learning algorithm captures the shallow recession of the early 1990s, the marked slow down (although not technically a recession) in the US economy in the early 2000s after the dotcom crash, and the recession of 2008/09. It does not predict a recession when one did not occur.\\nIn this paper, we extend the previous results on forecasting the Great Recession by examining the contributions made to the Great Recession of the late 2000s by each of the small set of financial variables used in the prediction models. We disaggregate private sector debt into its household and non-financial corporate components.\\nSection 2 describes the methodology, and section 3 the results.\\nAs described in Nyman and Ormerod (op.cit.), we try to replicate as closely as possible an actual forecasting situation.\\nThe dependent variable in our analysis is the third estimate of real GDP growth in the relevant quarter, rather than the most recent estimate which is now available. The third estimate is in general the one on which policy makers would rely when trying to judge the current state of the economy at the time.\\nFriedman and Schwartz (1963) argued that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies were largely to blame for the severity of the Great Depression. We therefore selected, on this a priori theoretical basis, a small set of monetary variables as potential explanatory factors. We selected them without any preliminary analysis as to whether they would be of any practical use in predicting recessions.</td>\n",

       "0  This paper proposes a single-bit consensus with ability to converge in finite-time. The main feature of this consensus protocol is the single-bit information update. The consensus protocol is proposed based on the sign of difference between state values. This implies that only single-bit of information (the sign) is required to update the state of the agents. This reduces the amount of processing/computation load and/or network communication load at each agent. It should be emphasized that in applications with real-time data processing where the computation and communication are required in faster time scale, the less computation and/or communication load is a significant merit. Since the protocol is nonlinear, a new Lyapunov function is proposed to prove consensus stability. Further, it is proved that for the proposed single-bit consensus protocol the Lyapunov function vanishes in finite-time, implying the finite-time convergence of the consensus protocol. In [4]–[6] finite-time consensus protocols are proposed, however these protocols impose large amount of computation on agents and are computationally less efficient than the proposed single-bit protocol in this paper.\\nQuantized consensus [12], [26], [27] is a related concept, where the agents reach consensus on quantized information with finite quantization levels for possibly unbounded data. In this direction [27] investigates a deterministic quantization based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In [12] authors adopt a single-bit quantized consensus method for detection based on Bayesian criterion and Neyman-Pearson criterion. In [13] the authors propose two consensus+innovation type distributed detectors based on Generalized Likelihood-Ratio Test (GLRT) for composite hypothesis testing via a group of sensors. Further, communication in multi-agent systems based on single-bit of information is also adopted in distributed detection [28], [29]. In these works a group of sensors are spatially distributed over a surveillance field to locally detect the existence of an uncooperative target and then communicate their single-bit decisions to a fusion center. The single-bit decisions are based on either the hybrid combination of GLRT and Bayesian estimation [29] or Generalized-Rao Test [28]. The fusion center combines the received information based on the fusion rules and makes a global decision.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) the proposed protocol is based on single-bit of information, which makes it practical in real-time system applications. This is the most important feature of our proposed protocol. (ii) a new Lyapunov function is proposed to prove the stability and convergence of this nonlinear consensus protocol under certain connectivity condition.   \n",

[33, Table 1A] shows a detailed account on the list of controllers used and their corresponding acceptance ratings. The popularity of this type of control laws arises from its ease of implementation and robustness due to its model independent nature. This popularity has equally pervaded robotic systems. In fact, there are formal guarantees of stability for a broad class of robots that includes manipulators [21,36]. See Table 1, which shows a list of stability results. A more detailed list of these types of control laws and the corresponding stability results are given in [5, Table 1.1].\\nDespite the increase in complexity of the models, PD control laws have dominated even the domain of bipedal robots. Bipedal locomotion is hybrid in nature, with alternating phases of continuous (swinging forward of the nonstance foot) and discrete events (instantaneous impact of the nonstance foot with ground). In addition, unlike the industrial robotic arms, which have a fixed base, bipedal robots are largely underactuated. Fig. 1 shows some examples of bipedal robots that used PD and PD based tracking control laws. It is worth noting that the reference trajectories that were tracked were obtained offline. In fact, the field of locomotion has largely focused on experimental realization by dividing the problem into two parts. First, obtain reference trajectories/gaits in a simulation model by using offline optimization tools [11,31]. Second, play these trajectories in the robot by a low level tracking control law [12,32,40]. Due to uncertainties in the system, model based controllers were generally avoided, thereby giving preference to the more traditional PD based control laws. These control laws are known to be “hassle free”, since they are model-independent and easy to implement. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to explore the stability properties of PD control laws for walking robots, which include varying levels of complexity due to the presence of impacts and underactuations.\\nWe will be establishing stability of PD control laws by the construction of strict Lyapunov functions developed by Arimoto et. al. [2], Koditschek [18], and Bayard and Wen [36] all in the same period of time 1984-1988. Local and global stability results were shown for both stationary and time varying desired configurations [15,19,38], but only for fully actuated systems.   \n",

Given a discrete or discretized set of interactions, one can then analyze communities, important nodes, and other facets of such networks by examining a multilayer-network representation of these interactions [1], [32], [40], [75]. An important challenge that arises with aggregation is that there may not be any obvious or even any ‘correct’ size of a time window (even when such aggregation employs non-uniform time windows [12], [68], [69], [74]). A window that is too small risks missing important network structures (e.g., by construing a signal as noise), but using an overly large window may obscure important temporal features. (See [18] for one discussion.) Moreover, in many social systems, interactions are bursty [4], [33], [41], which is a crucial consideration when aggregating interactions [31] and is potentially a major cause of concern when using homogeneous time windows [69]. Bursty interactions not only present a challenge when choosing the width of the time windows, but they also challenge where to place the boundaries such windows. Shifting time windows forward or backward may significantly alter the statistics of a data set, even when one does not change the width of the windows [41].\\nFrom a modeling perspective, aggregating interactions often may not be an appropriate approach for systems with asynchronous activity or which evolve continuously in time. See [79] for an investigation of biological contagions, [84] for a study of influential users in social networks, [85], [86] for a generalization of the formalism of ‘activity-driven networks’ to continuous time, [57] for a study of rankings in competitive sports, and [19] for a general continuous-time framework for temporal networks. In many cases, contacts in a temporal network can have a noninstantaneous duration, and it can be important to take such information into account [61], [71]. For example, the phone-call data that were studied in [28] require contacts to exist for the duration of a phone call. In other cases, interactions can be instantaneous (e.g., a mention in a tweet, a text message, and so on), and their importance decreases over time [11], [46]. For many types of temporal networks (e.g., feeds on social media), there is also a decay in attention span for reacting to posts [30], [49], [50].   \n",
       "3        Image and video upscaling has been studied for decades and remains an active topic of research because of constant technological advances in digital imaging. One scenario where upscaling is now more demanding arises in digital display technologies, where new standards like BT.2020 [1] are introduced. The resolution of digital displays has experienced a tremendous growth over the past few decades, as shown in Figure 1. The transition between different formats leads to a challenging problem. On one hand, large amount of digital content still exist in popular old standards such as standard– definition (SD). On the other hand, the latest display technologies (e.g. 4K, 8K and above) are expected to show this content with reasonable quality. Standard upscaling technologies are clearly insufficient for this purpose. While a 2× upscaler maps 1 input pixel into 4 output pixels, an 8× upscaler maps 1 input pixel into 64 output pixels, which already can contain a small image. The problem demands advanced solutions that are capable of understanding the content and filling in these large pieces of images with visually appealing and consistent information. In particular, large upscaling factors are needed to convert SD to ultra high–definition (UHD) resolutions. Thus, large upscaling represents a real problem in current market and it is expected to persist and become even more challenging with the rapid development of new technologies.\\nIn classical interpolation theory, upscaling images by integer factors is explained as two sequential processes: upsample (insert zeros) and filter [2], [3]. Standard upscaler algorithms, such as Bicubic or Lanczos, find high–resolution images with a narrow frequency content by using fixed low–pass filters. Modern tensor processing frameworks (e.g. Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.) implement this process using a so–called strided transposed convolutional layer. Similarly, the image acquisition process can be modeled as: filter and downsample (drop samples). Many times we know the explicit model, e.g. bicubic downscaler. Tensor processing frameworks implement this process using a strided convolutional layer.\\nMore advanced upscalers have followed geometric principles to improve image quality. For example, edge–directed interpolation uses adaptive filters to improve edge smoothness [4], [5], or bandlet methods use both adaptive upsampling and filtering [6]. Later on, machine learning has been able to use examples of pristine high–resolution images to learn a mapping from low–resolution [7]. The rise of deep–learning and convolutional networks in image classification tasks [8] quickly saw a series of important improvements in image resizing with large upscaling factors, which is the process widely know as image super–resolution (SR).   \n",

The failure to forecast the financial crisis recession of the late 2000s is well known. But this is a constant theme in the forecasting record over the past 50 years.\\nFor example, four quarters ahead, the mean prediction of the large number of forecasters reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters has never been for negative growth. In contrast, since 1968 there are 23 examples in the actual data of US real GDP growth being less than zero in a quarter.\\nNyman and Ormerod (op.cit.) show that applying a random forest algorithm to a small set of monetary variables generates four-quarter ahead predictions of real US GDP growth which are much better over the 1990-2017 period than those reported by the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Similar results are obtained for the UK.\\nThe machine learning algorithm captures the shallow recession of the early 1990s, the marked slow down (although not technically a recession) in the US economy in the early 2000s after the dotcom crash, and the recession of 2008/09. It does not predict a recession when one did not occur.\\nIn this paper, we extend the previous results on forecasting the Great Recession by examining the contributions made to the Great Recession of the late 2000s by each of the small set of financial variables used in the prediction models. We disaggregate private sector debt into its household and non-financial corporate components.\\nSection 2 describes the methodology, and section 3 the results.\\nAs described in Nyman and Ormerod (op.cit.), we try to replicate as closely as possible an actual forecasting situation.\\nThe dependent variable in our analysis is the third estimate of real GDP growth in the relevant quarter, rather than the most recent estimate which is now available. The third estimate is in general the one on which policy makers would rely when trying to judge the current state of the economy at the time.\\nFriedman and Schwartz (1963) argued that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies were largely to blame for the severity of the Great Depression. We therefore selected, on this a priori theoretical basis, a small set of monetary variables as potential explanatory factors. We selected them without any preliminary analysis as to whether they would be of any practical use in predicting recessions.   \n",

      "0  This paper proposes a single-bit consensus with ability to converge in finite-time. The main feature of this consensus protocol is the single-bit information update. The consensus protocol is proposed based on the sign of difference between state values. This implies that only single-bit of information (the sign) is required to update the state of the agents. This reduces the amount of processing/computation load and/or network communication load at each agent. It should be emphasized that in applications with real-time data processing where the computation and communication are required in faster time scale, the less computation and/or communication load is a significant merit. Since the protocol is nonlinear, a new Lyapunov function is proposed to prove consensus stability. Further, it is proved that for the proposed single-bit consensus protocol the Lyapunov function vanishes in finite-time, implying the finite-time convergence of the consensus protocol. In [4]–[6] finite-time consensus protocols are proposed, however these protocols impose large amount of computation on agents and are computationally less efficient than the proposed single-bit protocol in this paper.\\nQuantized consensus [12], [26], [27] is a related concept, where the agents reach consensus on quantized information with finite quantization levels for possibly unbounded data. In this direction [27] investigates a deterministic quantization based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In [12] authors adopt a single-bit quantized consensus method for detection based on Bayesian criterion and Neyman-Pearson criterion. In [13] the authors propose two consensus+innovation type distributed detectors based on Generalized Likelihood-Ratio Test (GLRT) for composite hypothesis testing via a group of sensors. Further, communication in multi-agent systems based on single-bit of information is also adopted in distributed detection [28], [29]. In these works a group of sensors are spatially distributed over a surveillance field to locally detect the existence of an uncooperative target and then communicate their single-bit decisions to a fusion center. The single-bit decisions are based on either the hybrid combination of GLRT and Bayesian estimation [29] or Generalized-Rao Test [28]. The fusion center combines the received information based on the fusion rules and makes a global decision.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) the proposed protocol is based on single-bit of information, which makes it practical in real-time system applications. This is the most important feature of our proposed protocol. (ii) a new Lyapunov function is proposed to prove the stability and convergence of this nonlinear consensus protocol under certain connectivity condition.   \n",

[33, Table 1A] shows a detailed account on the list of controllers used and their corresponding acceptance ratings. The popularity of this type of control laws arises from its ease of implementation and robustness due to its model independent nature. This popularity has equally pervaded robotic systems. In fact, there are formal guarantees of stability for a broad class of robots that includes manipulators [21,36]. See Table 1, which shows a list of stability results. A more detailed list of these types of control laws and the corresponding stability results are given in [5, Table 1.1].\\nDespite the increase in complexity of the models, PD control laws have dominated even the domain of bipedal robots. Bipedal locomotion is hybrid in nature, with alternating phases of continuous (swinging forward of the nonstance foot) and discrete events (instantaneous impact of the nonstance foot with ground). In addition, unlike the industrial robotic arms, which have a fixed base, bipedal robots are largely underactuated. Fig. 1 shows some examples of bipedal robots that used PD and PD based tracking control laws. It is worth noting that the reference trajectories that were tracked were obtained offline. In fact, the field of locomotion has largely focused on experimental realization by dividing the problem into two parts. First, obtain reference trajectories/gaits in a simulation model by using offline optimization tools [11,31]. Second, play these trajectories in the robot by a low level tracking control law [12,32,40]. Due to uncertainties in the system, model based controllers were generally avoided, thereby giving preference to the more traditional PD based control laws. These control laws are known to be “hassle free”, since they are model-independent and easy to implement. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to explore the stability properties of PD control laws for walking robots, which include varying levels of complexity due to the presence of impacts and underactuations.\\nWe will be establishing stability of PD control laws by the construction of strict Lyapunov functions developed by Arimoto et. al. [2], Koditschek [18], and Bayard and Wen [36] all in the same period of time 1984-1988. Local and global stability results were shown for both stationary and time varying desired configurations [15,19,38], but only for fully actuated systems.   \n",

Given a discrete or discretized set of interactions, one can then analyze communities, important nodes, and other facets of such networks by examining a multilayer-network representation of these interactions [1], [32], [40], [75]. An important challenge that arises with aggregation is that there may not be any obvious or even any ‘correct’ size of a time window (even when such aggregation employs non-uniform time windows [12], [68], [69], [74]). A window that is too small risks missing important network structures (e.g., by construing a signal as noise), but using an overly large window may obscure important temporal features. (See [18] for one discussion.) Moreover, in many social systems, interactions are bursty [4], [33], [41], which is a crucial consideration when aggregating interactions [31] and is potentially a major cause of concern when using homogeneous time windows [69]. Bursty interactions not only present a challenge when choosing the width of the time windows, but they also challenge where to place the boundaries such windows. Shifting time windows forward or backward may significantly alter the statistics of a data set, even when one does not change the width of the windows [41].\\nFrom a modeling perspective, aggregating interactions often may not be an appropriate approach for systems with asynchronous activity or which evolve continuously in time. See [79] for an investigation of biological contagions, [84] for a study of influential users in social networks, [85], [86] for a generalization of the formalism of ‘activity-driven networks’ to continuous time, [57] for a study of rankings in competitive sports, and [19] for a general continuous-time framework for temporal networks. In many cases, contacts in a temporal network can have a noninstantaneous duration, and it can be important to take such information into account [61], [71]. For example, the phone-call data that were studied in [28] require contacts to exist for the duration of a phone call. In other cases, interactions can be instantaneous (e.g., a mention in a tweet, a text message, and so on), and their importance decreases over time [11], [46]. For many types of temporal networks (e.g., feeds on social media), there is also a decay in attention span for reacting to posts [30], [49], [50].   \n",
      "3        Image and video upscaling has been studied for decades and remains an active topic of research because of constant technological advances in digital imaging. One scenario where upscaling is now more demanding arises in digital display technologies, where new standards like BT.2020 [1] are introduced. The resolution of digital displays has experienced a tremendous growth over the past few decades, as shown in Figure 1. The transition between different formats leads to a challenging problem. On one hand, large amount of digital content still exist in popular old standards such as standard– definition (SD). On the other hand, the latest display technologies (e.g. 4K, 8K and above) are expected to show this content with reasonable quality. Standard upscaling technologies are clearly insufficient for this purpose. While a 2× upscaler maps 1 input pixel into 4 output pixels, an 8× upscaler maps 1 input pixel into 64 output pixels, which already can contain a small image. The problem demands advanced solutions that are capable of understanding the content and filling in these large pieces of images with visually appealing and consistent information. In particular, large upscaling factors are needed to convert SD to ultra high–definition (UHD) resolutions. Thus, large upscaling represents a real problem in current market and it is expected to persist and become even more challenging with the rapid development of new technologies.\\nIn classical interpolation theory, upscaling images by integer factors is explained as two sequential processes: upsample (insert zeros) and filter [2], [3]. Standard upscaler algorithms, such as Bicubic or Lanczos, find high–resolution images with a narrow frequency content by using fixed low–pass filters. Modern tensor processing frameworks (e.g. Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.) implement this process using a so–called strided transposed convolutional layer. Similarly, the image acquisition process can be modeled as: filter and downsample (drop samples). Many times we know the explicit model, e.g. bicubic downscaler. Tensor processing frameworks implement this process using a strided convolutional layer.\\nMore advanced upscalers have followed geometric principles to improve image quality. For example, edge–directed interpolation uses adaptive filters to improve edge smoothness [4], [5], or bandlet methods use both adaptive upsampling and filtering [6]. Later on, machine learning has been able to use examples of pristine high–resolution images to learn a mapping from low–resolution [7]. The rise of deep–learning and convolutional networks in image classification tasks [8] quickly saw a series of important improvements in image resizing with large upscaling factors, which is the process widely know as image super–resolution (SR).   \n",

The failure to forecast the financial crisis recession of the late 2000s is well known. But this is a constant theme in the forecasting record over the past 50 years.\\nFor example, four quarters ahead, the mean prediction of the large number of forecasters reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters has never been for negative growth. In contrast, since 1968 there are 23 examples in the actual data of US real GDP growth being less than zero in a quarter.\\nNyman and Ormerod (op.cit.) show that applying a random forest algorithm to a small set of monetary variables generates four-quarter ahead predictions of real US GDP growth which are much better over the 1990-2017 period than those reported by the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Similar results are obtained for the UK.\\nThe machine learning algorithm captures the shallow recession of the early 1990s, the marked slow down (although not technically a recession) in the US economy in the early 2000s after the dotcom crash, and the recession of 2008/09. It does not predict a recession when one did not occur.\\nIn this paper, we extend the previous results on forecasting the Great Recession by examining the contributions made to the Great Recession of the late 2000s by each of the small set of financial variables used in the prediction models. We disaggregate private sector debt into its household and non-financial corporate components.\\nSection 2 describes the methodology, and section 3 the results.\\nAs described in Nyman and Ormerod (op.cit.), we try to replicate as closely as possible an actual forecasting situation.\\nThe dependent variable in our analysis is the third estimate of real GDP growth in the relevant quarter, rather than the most recent estimate which is now available. The third estimate is in general the one on which policy makers would rely when trying to judge the current state of the economy at the time.\\nFriedman and Schwartz (1963) argued that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies were largely to blame for the severity of the Great Depression. We therefore selected, on this a priori theoretical basis, a small set of monetary variables as potential explanatory factors. We selected them without any preliminary analysis as to whether they would be of any practical use in predicting recessions.   \n",

Medicine also benefits from differentiation, particularly in understanding the spread of diseases by analyzing infection rates over time.  \\n\\nIntegration, on the other hand, focuses on summing up small parts to determine the whole. It is widely used in physics to compute distances traveled when speed varies over time. Engineers apply it when designing structures, ensuring that materials are distributed in a way that supports weight effectively. In economics, integration helps estimate total revenue over a period by adding up earnings from different time intervals. Environmental science uses it to measure the total amount of pollutants released into the air or water over a given period.  \\n\\nBoth differentiation and integration are deeply connected. Differentiation breaks things down into smaller changes, while integration pieces them together to form a complete picture. These principles are essential in fields like artificial intelligence, where algorithms adjust based on changing inputs, and in medicine, where doctors analyze how medications interact with the body over time. Even in everyday life, such as adjusting the speed of a car smoothly or planning expenses over months, these concepts come into play.  \\n\\nCalculus is not just an abstract mathematical tool but a way to understand and predict the world around us.

       "      <td>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on change and accumulation. It is divided into two main areas: differentiation and integration. Differentiation is related to the rate at which things change, while integration is related to the accumulation of quantities in time or space. These concepts are fundamental to understanding various real-world phenomena.  \\n\\nDifferentiation helps analyze how one quantity changes in response to another. For example, in physics it is used to determine the speed of a moving object by studying how its position changes over time. In business, companies rely on it to study how profits change with changes in production or pricing strategy. Medicine also benefits from differentiation, especially in understanding the spread of disease by analyzing infection rates over time.  \\n\\nIntegration, on the other hand, focuses on combining small parts to define the whole. It is widely used in physics to calculate distances traveled when speed changes over time. Engineers use it to design structures, ensuring that materials are distributed so that they effectively support weight. In economics, integration helps estimate total income over a period by adding up income over different time periods. In environmental science, it is used to measure the total amount of pollutants released into the air or water over a given period.  \\n\\nBoth differentiation and integration are closely related. Differentiation breaks down changes into smaller ones, while integration brings them together to form a holistic picture. These principles are important in fields such as artificial intelligence, where algorithms adjust based on changing inputs, and medicine, where doctors analyze how drugs interact with the body over time. These concepts even apply to everyday life, such as regulating the speed of a car or planning expenses months in advance.  \\n\\nCalculus is not just an abstract mathematical tool, but also a way to understand and predict the world around us. From designing safer roads to optimizing energy consumption, it provides valuable insights across countless disciplines. Its ability to explain patterns of change and accumulation makes it indispensable in science, technology, economics and beyond.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Calculus is one part of mathematics that study about change and accumulation. It have two main parts: differentiation and integration. Differentiation is about how things change quickly, while integration is about collecting quantities in time or space. These ideas are very important for understanding many real-life situations.\\n\\nDifferentiation help to study how one thing change because of another thing. For example, in physics, people use it to know how fast object is moving by looking at how position change in time. In business, company use differentiation to check how profit is different when production or price change. Also, medicine can use this to see how fast disease spread by checking how many people get sick in different time.\\n\\nOn the other side, integration is for adding small parts to find total amount. In physics, it help to calculate distance when speed is not always same. Engineers use it when they make building, to be sure materials are in correct place to support weight. In economics, it is useful to find total money earned in long time by adding money from different period. Environmental science also use integration to measure how much pollution is put in air or water in some time.\\n\\nDifferentiation and integration are very connected. Differentiation break things into small change, and integration bring them back together to see whole picture. These ideas are very important in many area, like artificial intelligence, where system change when input change, and in medicine, where doctors check how medicine work in human body for some time. Even in daily life, people use it when they drive car and change speed slowly or when they plan money for many months.\\n\\nCalculus is not only difficult math, but also useful way to see and understand world. It help for making safer roads, using energy in better way, and many other things. Because it explain how things change and collect together, calculus is very important in science, engineering, economy, and more.</td>\n",

       "0  Calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on change and accumulation. It is divided into two main areas: differentiation and integration. Differentiation is related to the rate at which things change, while integration is related to the accumulation of quantities in time or space. These concepts are fundamental to understanding various real-world phenomena.  \\n\\nDifferentiation helps analyze how one quantity changes in response to another. For example, in physics it is used to determine the speed of a moving object by studying how its position changes over time. In business, companies rely on it to study how profits change with changes in production or pricing strategy. Medicine also benefits from differentiation, especially in understanding the spread of disease by analyzing infection rates over time.  \\n\\nIntegration, on the other hand, focuses on combining small parts to define the whole. It is widely used in physics to calculate distances traveled when speed changes over time. Engineers use it to design structures, ensuring that materials are distributed so that they effectively support weight. In economics, integration helps estimate total income over a period by adding up income over different time periods. In environmental science, it is used to measure the total amount of pollutants released into the air or water over a given period.  \\n\\nBoth differentiation and integration are closely related. Differentiation breaks down changes into smaller ones, while integration brings them together to form a holistic picture. These principles are important in fields such as artificial intelligence, where algorithms adjust based on changing inputs, and medicine, where doctors analyze how drugs interact with the body over time. These concepts even apply to everyday life, such as regulating the speed of a car or planning expenses months in advance.  \\n\\nCalculus is not just an abstract mathematical tool, but also a way to understand and predict the world around us. From designing safer roads to optimizing energy consumption, it provides valuable insights across countless disciplines. Its ability to explain patterns of change and accumulation makes it indispensable in science, technology, economics and beyond.   \n",

       "      <td>My name is Aaliyah Popova, and I am a jeweler with 13 years of experience. I remember a very unique and challenging project I had to work on last year. A customer approached me with a precious family heirloom - a diamond necklace that had been passed down through generations. Unfortunately, the necklace was in poor condition, with several loose diamonds and a broken clasp. The customer wanted me to restore it to its former glory, but it was clear that this would be no ordinary repair. Using my specialized tools and techniques, I began the delicate task of dismantling the necklace. Each diamond was carefully removed from its setting, and the damaged clasp was removed. Once the necklace was completely disassembled, I meticulously cleaned each diamond and inspected it for any damage. Fortunately, the diamonds were all in good condition, with no cracks or chips. The next step was to repair the broken clasp. I carefully soldered the broken pieces back together, ensuring that the clasp was sturdy and secure. Once the clasp was repaired, I began the process of reassembling the necklace. Each diamond was carefully placed back into its setting, and the necklace was polished until it sparkled like new. When I presented the restored necklace to the customer, they were overjoyed. They couldn't believe that I had been able to bring their family heirloom back to life. The necklace looked as beautiful as it had when it was first created, and the customer was thrilled to have it back in their possession. If you have a project that you would like to discuss, please feel free to contact me by phone at (95) 94215-7906 or by email at aaliyah.popova4783@aol.edu. I look forward to hearing from you! P.S.: When I'm not creating beautiful jewelry, I enjoy spending time podcasting. I love sharing my knowledge about jewelry and connecting with other people who are passionate about this art form. I also enjoy spending time with my family and exploring new places.

       "0  My name is Aaliyah Popova, and I am a jeweler with 13 years of experience. I remember a very unique and challenging project I had to work on last year. A customer approached me with a precious family heirloom - a diamond necklace that had been passed down through generations. Unfortunately, the necklace was in poor condition, with several loose diamonds and a broken clasp. The customer wanted me to restore it to its former glory, but it was clear that this would be no ordinary repair. Using my specialized tools and techniques, I began the delicate task of dismantling the necklace. Each diamond was carefully removed from its setting, and the damaged clasp was removed. Once the necklace was completely disassembled, I meticulously cleaned each diamond and inspected it for any damage. Fortunately, the diamonds were all in good condition, with no cracks or chips. The next step was to repair the broken clasp. I carefully soldered the broken pieces back together, ensuring that the clasp was sturdy and secure. Once the clasp was repaired, I began the process of reassembling the necklace. Each diamond was carefully placed back into its setting, and the necklace was polished until it sparkled like new. When I presented the restored necklace to the customer, they were overjoyed. They couldn't believe that I had been able to bring their family heirloom back to life. The necklace looked as beautiful as it had when it was first created, and the customer was thrilled to have it back in their possession. If you have a project that you would like to discuss, please feel free to contact me by phone at (95) 94215-7906 or by email at aaliyah.popova4783@aol.edu. I look forward to hearing from you! P.S.: When I'm not creating beautiful jewelry, I enjoy spending time podcasting. I love sharing my knowledge about jewelry and connecting with other people who are passionate about this art form. I also enjoy spending time with my family and exploring new places.

      "0  My name is Aaliyah Popova, and I am a jeweler with 13 years of experience. I remember a very unique and challenging project I had to work on last year. A customer approached me with a precious family heirloom - a diamond necklace that had been passed down through generations. Unfortunately, the necklace was in poor condition, with several loose diamonds and a broken clasp. The customer wanted me to restore it to its former glory, but it was clear that this would be no ordinary repair. Using my specialized tools and techniques, I began the delicate task of dismantling the necklace. Each diamond was carefully removed from its setting, and the damaged clasp was removed. Once the necklace was completely disassembled, I meticulously cleaned each diamond and inspected it for any damage. Fortunately, the diamonds were all in good condition, with no cracks or chips. The next step was to repair the broken clasp. I carefully soldered the broken pieces back together, ensuring that the clasp was sturdy and secure. Once the clasp was repaired, I began the process of reassembling the necklace. Each diamond was carefully placed back into its setting, and the necklace was polished until it sparkled like new. When I presented the restored necklace to the customer, they were overjoyed. They couldn't believe that I had been able to bring their family heirloom back to life. The necklace looked as beautiful as it had when it was first created, and the customer was thrilled to have it back in their possession. If you have a project that you would like to discuss, please feel free to contact me by phone at (95) 94215-7906 or by email at aaliyah.popova4783@aol.edu. I look forward to hearing from you! P.S.: When I'm not creating beautiful jewelry, I enjoy spending time podcasting. I love sharing my knowledge about jewelry and connecting with other people who are passionate about this art form. I also enjoy spending time with my family and exploring new places. If you would like to learn more about me, please feel free to visit my website at [website address] or visit me at my studio located at 97 Lincoln Street.   \n",
